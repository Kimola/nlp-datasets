# Datasets
Is the best way to truly discover a place by going there or by checking out people’s experiences first? We chose the latter and created a comprehensive dataset by collecting user reviews of various places on **TripAdvisor**! Reviews in different categories reveal visitors’ satisfaction, criticisms, and what impressed them the most. We uploaded this data to GitHub so you can analyze it and create interesting reports. In other words, the most data-driven way to discover a place is right here!
## British Museum (Attraction) Dataset
**The British Museum** is a cultural treasure that sheds light on human history and is home to one of the most impressive collections in the world! [This dataset](https://github.com/Kimola/nlp-datasets/blob/main/tripadvisor-reviews/British%20Museum%20(Attraction)%20-%20Tripadvisor%20Reviews.csv), which we created by compiling user reviews on **TripAdvisor**, includes how visitors evaluate their museum experiences, their opinions on the works on display, the density of the crowds and the directions inside the museum. While some are fascinated by the Rosetta Stone, others complain, 'How am I going to visit all these things in one day?' If you want to analyze what kind of experience the British Museum offers from the visitor's perspective, this dataset is for you!
## Giolitti (Ice Cream Shop in Rome) Dataset
