"Tons of stuff. Indigenous from Canada, and still practice our culture. Give us back those pipes you are not supposed to have them!!! It was gone during our observations and being 'studied'. Not nice, please contact me if management reads this.Pipes are very sacred, and are not to be put together unless you have the gift and right to do so. My guess is that it is touched all willy nilly.Even if you drank alcohol within 4 days of touching it you are disrepecting it.Even if you have partner 'relations' and touch it you are disprecting it.If it is put together for no good reason (ie. ""Studying it""), this means connecting the pipe stem and bowl (they're in 2 different pieces), you better have a darn good reason why, because you will catch the attention of alot of spiritual helpers and the Creator.I'm sharing this because we learn through education. I'm sharing this because ignorance got us here in the first place and education will get us out.Some of these pipes were taken from gravesites (archaeological digs). When a pipe carrier is done physically on this world they either:1. Pass it on to a worthy carrier who is clean from drugs/alcohol/bad mind. Even deeper meaningful restrictions as you keep following the pipe road.2. Buried with carrier to help them get to the spirit world.If you have any decency, please feel free to reach out to me. Too long have my people stayed silent. We carry pipe (my family), and we dont take it lightly. We come from this picture you have displayed and the same area where Poundmaker is from.ekosi maka,Sincerely,wapastimWhite Horse",2023-01-06
"I had the incredible opportunity to visit the British Museum for two consecutive days, and even that didn't feel like enough time to truly explore this cultural treasure trove. The museum is a colossal space, housing an awe-inspiring variety of artifacts and exhibitions. For anyone who loves history and art, it's an unparalleled experience.I opted for the audio guide by downloading the museum's app, hoping for an enhanced experience. While the audio guide was somewhat average in its delivery, it still provided useful context and narratives that enriched my visit.The museum itself is bustling, drawing crowds from all corners of the world, testament to its global significance. For a more intimate experience, I highly recommend visiting early in the morning. Despite the crowds, amenities like cafes and bathrooms are plentiful, making the visit comfortable and convenient.The only downside was that the Elgin Marbles were not accessible during my visit, which was disappointing but didn't detract from the overall enriching experience.In conclusion, the British Museum stands as one of the world's leading museums, offering an overwhelming array of exhibits and artifacts. While the audio guide could use improvement, the museum's offerings are so expansive and intriguing that it's easily forgivable. Whether you're a casual tourist or a dedicated history buff, the British Museum is an absolute must-visit when in London",2023-01-03
"Whatever your position is in relation to the morality of Britain acting as a keeper of important historical artefacts from all around the world, it's undeniably amazing to visit such a place as this museum. Be prepared. If you're the kind of person who likes a more in-depth approach to each exhibition, you will not be able to see a significant part of it in a single day. It will be mostly a succession of visits over the years until you've covered it. You will see historically famous artefacts such as the Rosetta Stone and busts that inspired well-known memorable poems, amazing creations from the dawn of humanity, and other breathtaking wonders kept in pristine condition and given the respect they deserve. Be aware that because of its free entrance, even on weekdays and on school days, it will be eternally crowded, and you may have to fight your way through platoons of touring visitors with their guides, and battle to get in front of instagrammers and influencers to see main attractions. Nevertheless, completely worth it.",2023-01-06
"The British Museum, a place where history seeps from every nook and cranny, and the architecture is so impressive that even the statues are wondering if they could pull it off. It's like a labyrinth designed by an ancient history-loving architect with a sense of humor as dry as the Sahara.You'll encounter more artifacts than a seasoned time traveler's garage sale. From Egyptian mummies trying to play hide-and-seek with you to Greek statues striking poses that could give yoga instructors a run for their drachmas, the museum is a real-life ""Antiques Roadshow.""And if you ever lose your way amidst the treasures, don't fret; just consider it an exclusive behind-the-scenes tour. If the artifacts had a voice, they'd likely say, ""We've been collecting dust and historical anecdotes for eons, but we're always up for some witty banter and a chance to be the life of the museum party!"" 😄🏛️",2023-01-02
"Beautiful museum!It’s huge, so wear your walking shoes!The museum is free. I went on a Thursday afternoon and it was pretty busy. There are school field trips, bus tour groups, and plenty of other people visiting.You can check your cost for £2 and a bag for £2.50.The highlight is the Rosetta Stone! But there’s plenty of very interesting and amazing artifacts and art.The gift shop is huge and has tons of wonderful things to buy. Prices are a little high. It was £13.50 for a metal bookmark. You can spend an hour just in the gift shop.There’s a place to eat and drink inside.Give yourself at least 3-4 hours to go through.There are black cabs parked right outside if you need one. I got the nicest lady driver named Zoe to take me to my hotel.I’m going to go back again before leaving London. It was a wonderful experience.",2023-01-05
"Come to London to learn about your home country! All jokes about the British Empire aside, this actually is a really nice museum. The self guided audio tour through the application was quite nice.I will say, the History of the World tour does take you up and down the stairs several times and at one point even has you back track, but I imagine it's trying to do it in chronological order.As a result you walk through many other galleries between POIs on the self guided tour so you get to see a fair bit of it. It's quite interesting seeing all the things you've learned about in history class in person. Was even more amusing seeing things from my home town in the museum.Also: Visit the room with all the clocks. It's probably my favorite room. So many fascinating clocks from throughout time.",2023-01-02
"Love this place you canFind this place by South Kensington tubeBus 360 stops outsideThe museum is quite a  large place.

"Uno de los museos más completo del mundo, con acceso gratuito a una muestra permanente inmensa. Culturas desde Grecia, Babilonia, Mesopotamia, Romana, China, Hindú, Europea, entre otras. Se brindan guías gratuitas con cupos limitados. No hay mapas en español y la aplicación con audioguia no está apta para todos los países,  recomendable descargar otra. Existen cafés dentro por si da hambre (luego de tanta historia).Discrepo de la tenencia por parte de Inglaterra de estos objetos, pero es cierto que los han preservado adecuadamente.Imperdible en Londres.",2023-01-05
"A place which will make you to understand our history , era of civilisation , explicit countries prosperity and architecture, a must visit place , need minimum 4 hours to 5 hours , if you are photographer and want to click many photos than you need a power bank as your battery will run out of charge by clicking photos . It is free but not for some galaries , better to book online in advance to avoid waiting period particularly during week ends .",2023-01-02
"Wspaniałe zbiory obejrzane trochę bo co to jest pół dnia dla zbiorów kultury i religii całego świata. W każdej sali mnóstwo skarbów niczego nie można odpuścić trzeba tam wracać przy każdym pobycie. W zasadzie wszystko o czym czytamy oglądamy filmy tam jest. Mumie egipskie ,porcelana chińska złote  bożki  posągi rzeźby a wszystko to w ogromnych ilościach. Wejście bezpłatne ale długie kolejki szybko posuwające się. Audio przewodnik jest.",2023-01-05
"Hay más historia dentro de este museo que en el propio Egipto y otros países. Las expropiación de riquezas es increíble. Si quieres conocer mundo en un sólo día, éste es tu sitio, aunque es una pena no poder ver todo esto insitu. Las entradas son gratuitas, debes reservarlas a través de la web, así que recomiendo la visita del 100%. Yo lo hice de manera muy organizada porque contaba con menos de 2 horas, pero recomiendo 4, 5 horas...",2023-01-05
"My husband and I love the British Museum. But when we arrived the queue was enormous. We are both in our mid seventies and there was no way we were standing in a extremely long queue. So gave up and walked down to Trafalgar Square to the National Gallery, then lunch in St Martins in the Field, followed by a walk to Buck House. I'm not sure if you can buy timed tickets but I would certainly check that out before trying to visit again.",2023-01-07
"El museo es muy recomendable para ver todo lo que los ingleses se han traído de otros países, y sobre todo de Egipto.  Destacar la piedra Roseta y momias varias.  Eso sí, esas salas suelen estar llenas de gente y hay mucho más que ver.La visita es gratuita. Nosotros reservamos la entrada por su web, y al llegar nadie nos pidió nada.Recomendación: hay salas increíbles, piérdete por ellas y lo disfrutarás mucho más.",2023-01-06
"Great collection of artefacts. I highly recommend joining a free walking tour because it really helps to focus on the key exhibits. Worth buying a ticket for a specific timeslot as security queues can be really long during the weekend. Also bear in mind that  there are 2 entrances, the Main entrance has a massive queue for security checks, however northern Entrance queue can be much shorter.",2023-01-06
"Es impresionante el volumen expuesto. Tienen muchísimo material de diferentes culturas y civilizaciones antiguas. Personalmente, destacaría lo impactante que es la parte de Egipto, y también de Grecia, así como la temporal de Japón. El hecho de que la entrada sea gratuita es genial. Lo malo es que suele estar demasiado masificado, pero aún así, creo que es un imprescindible de Londres.",2023-01-01
"Uno de los museos más famosos de Europa y del mundo. Es impresionante desde que uno ingresa, la cantidad de cultura e historia que hay en su interior es tremenda.Lo bueno: la enorme amplitud de piezas que se pueden ver. El acceso no es complicado si a uno le gusta caminar. Sus salas son amplias. Es gratis.Lo malo: cierra temprano, solo por buscarle algún punto negativo.",2023-01-05
"The British Museum is the oldest museum in the world, they have a lot of items in their collection. The most famous one is probably the Egyptian collection. They have pieces of incredible value, like the Rosetta stone and the Younger Memnon. The other collections are also very interesting, although the Americas exhibitions were closed so I didn't get to see those.",2023-01-06
"Great educational experience, the museum is honestly so huge that it could be a full day experience. I was a little disappointed the app was all pay per section, there was only 1 free audio guide. I suppose that comes at the cost of free admission. I do recommend getting a timed ticket which will cut down on the time spent in line getting in.",2023-01-03
"One of the best museums in the world.  Egyptian collection very complete with the Rosetta Stone as rock star, lots of very interesting mummies, statues,  and many artifacts..... and just talking about one collection. There are many other collections in there. The bookstore is awesome.  Visiting this museum is mandatory if you go to London.",2023-01-07
The staple of museums in London in terms of collections and size. The only hitch for me was it was very crowded in every section (even if the museum was really hugee) and also they closed some of the sections which are very interesting for me (the greek section) but other than that it was a marvelous visit,2023-01-03
"Despite a good amount of the antiquities was stolen from their original countries in the past, it’s an amazing place to visit!The display is exceptional!The antiquities are taken care of professionally.A must visit for sure!Oh and one more thing, no tickets, entry is free, but you can donate if you like.",2023-01-06
"Te recomiendo reservar tus tickets con antelación por internet, es sencillo y gratis. Yo reserve a las 10 de la mañana y 15 minutos antes no había apenas gente (por la puerta de atrás), la gente se acumula en la principal, mi consejo es que entres por la parte de atrás es más rápido y hay menos cola.",2023-01-07
"Most knowledgeable. If you even remember your school studies it will virtually takes you to the great imagination of ancient civilizations like Aztec , Mayan , Egyptian,Roman , Hindu etc. I feel I should visit several times to unearth this hidden treasure. This museum is outstanding 👍👍👍👍👍",2023-01-07
"There's no need to rate it, of course it's amazing. free? ! I was surprised by that (donations are collected, so I put a considerable amount in the box)The gift shop is large but mainly sells books. I had high expectations, but I was disappointed that I couldn't find what I wanted to buy.",2023-01-03
"When in with the perception of "" stolen goods"" , but it was nice to see so many people reading about  Indian things and being curious about it.I thought they probably would never get an opportunity to go to India. Maybe this tiny exposure might be there chance to see our stolen goods.",2023-01-02
"Beautiful tourist attraction. Most of the rooms are free. You’ll need a good 4 hours minimum to explore the museum. Loads of things to see.. Ancient Egypt is marvellous with the Mummy view. Africa section is a must see, Yoruba and Benin history. The museum is satisfactory..",2023-01-01
"Immenso, spettacolare, reperti da tutto il mondo. Forse tra le collezioni più complete esposte in un museo. Impossibile da visitare tutto in un giorno per quanto è grande. Ma il fatto che i musei a Londra sono gratis invoglia a fare un altra visita. Assolutamente da vedere",2023-01-07
"It's very nice. It has many things and exhibitions from all over the world. Inside is the rosette stone.The entrance is very beautiful architecturally, and the visit is also free.I'm not one to go to museums too much, but I really liked this one and I recommend it.",2023-01-02
Can spend multiple days in the British Museum and still not finish looking at artifacts. The Egypt and Assyria collections are incredible. Recommend coming in when the museum opens to enjoy some time before the big afternoon crowds. Need multiple days to enjoy it.,2023-01-07
"Haven't been for nearly 40 years, but wow!  One of those places that just take your breath away.   Only had time to see the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles, both with a short guided talk.  You need a day, or ideally a few, to really take it all in.",2023-01-05
It’s a must see for anyone visiting. Free entry and if there is no queue you get in almost instantly. It’s full of tourists but that also a vibe … people from all over the world. You get to explore many continents in one place … interesting experience,2023-01-07

I found the souvenirs shop more interesting than the museum itself 😅 You can download an audio app but there aren't that many things to listen to...there are more things to read than to listen to~,2023-01-07
"There are so many people gathered around the Rosetta Stone that it is difficult to take a calm look at it.Because there are few Japanese tourists, there are no audio guides available in Japanese.",2023-01-03

"전시물들이 잘 정리되어 전시되었으며, 편리하게 관람할 수 있게 구조적으로 잘 설께된 것 같음. 런던을 방문하면 한번쯤은 꼭 와보면 좋을 곳이라고 생각합니다. 그리고 주변에 런던 대학과 공원도 있어서 다양한 볼거리도 많습니다. 트라팔가 광장과도 가까워서, 저녁에 뮤지컬 한편을 보는거도 강추합니다. ^^",2023-01-07

"You could spend all day here, it’s clean and so much to see. It’s free entry, please donate what you can afford as it can go towards maintaining the museum.",2023-01-08
見るべき物が多過ぎて時間がいくらあっても足りません。1日中見て歩いても良い位です。予め予備知識を持って見た方が効率的です。初めてだと展示場所が分かり難いので、右往左往するばかりとなります。休憩場所があり、適度に休みながら見学してください。入場料金は無料なのでじっくりと見学するのが良いと思います。,2023-01-04
