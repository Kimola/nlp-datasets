7/6/22,FedExField - Landover,"This was my second time to see Coldplay, and once again, it was a thrill! From the moment the guys came on stage, the music was awesome, as were the lights and fireworks. I have been a Coldplay fan for many years, and seeing them live has created some of my very best memories. It's amazing how good music can make you feel. I also love the fact that Coldplay does so many positive things with their fame and money, which is not something you see that often from celebrities. There were images and information projected prior to the concert to show some of their worldwide projects. As far as the musical selection, there was a great mix from all of the albums, from Parachutes to Music of the Spheres. My daughter's boyfriend, who is actually a country fan, was impressed and even commented that ""Chris Martin has the voice of an angel."" (Well, I already knew that, but still...) It was a really fun night, and I can't wait to see my British Boys again!"
9/7/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,I’m tears from the moment the fireworks went off to the very end. An amazing experience I’ll never forget. I wish I could live this concert again ❤️
6/9/22,FedExField - Landover,Amazing. Judt like last time. Took my son this time (he's 9) and he had a blast too. Will come see them again next time they come!
6/10/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"I bought a ticket to see Coldplay by myself for their show in Chicago on the 28th of May. I had such a GREAT time that I decided to purchase a ticket for their show on the 29th. I’m glad that I did, this experience was so surreal. Definitely one of the best concerts that I’ve EVER been to"
6/10/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"The light show was amazing! It was like a big EDM party with lights flashing, pyrotechnics, and Chris Martin's insatiable energy. They played for over 2 hours on 2 stages and Lupe Fiasco joined them to sing 2 songs. Opener H.E.R. seemed off rhythm with her guitar but first opener Drama was an amazing Soul singer. Venue was so-so, but seeing Coldplay for the first time in 20 years was very different than the first 2 smaller venues I saw them at. Good that they're trying to keep up though."
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"This was the best concert I’ve had!!! All the experience was great (with the exception of the parking logistic). But everything was awesoooome!! The sound, the show, food, seats, EVERYTHIIIIING!!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"I wasn’t even that into Coldplay, just going with a friend, but I was quickly won over. They waited to start because so many people were held back by the horrible traffic, so I didn’t miss the show! The event made an effort to have environmental initiatives that I’ve never seen before, including having people on bikes and kinetic floors powering it. I loved the performance aspect of engaging the crowd as well as the music- even though I only knew their old stuff, their new songs were great too. So much fun!"
6/12/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The Coldplay concert was well worth attending.  It was an entertaining event.  The two acts preceding the main event were all right.  
My husband and I hope to attend future concerts as long as they keep touring."
7/12/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"I loved seeing Coldplay at Soldier Field. It was my first stadium concert and my first time seeing Coldplay. I loved every second of it. I did NOT sit down. I danced the entire concert, with the exception of going to the bathroom and beer runs. I HIGHLY recommend going to see Coldplay!! They put on a great show. If Coldplay comes to your town GO SEE THEM!!!"
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay was amazing!! Had such a great time, they played a wide variety of songs and really incorporated the fans well!"
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay's live performances are nothing short of spectacular. Their concerts are a visual and auditory feast, with stunning visuals, vibrant light displays, and Chris Martin's infectious energy captivating audiences worldwide. The band's ability to connect with their fans on such an intimate level, creating an atmosphere of unity and collective euphoria, is a testament to their genuine love for their craft.

Coldplay's enchanting melodies and thought-provoking lyrics will undoubtedly leave you craving for more.

Truly one of the beat shows I have seen!"
10/3/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Okayish performance compared to previous concerts I have attended. The wristbands lights were for a very short time and not very good.
10/3/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,My hubby & I had a blast seeing Coldplay for the first time at Snapdragon stadium in San Diego Sept 28!  They were humble and put on a fantastic show!  So glad we didn’t miss this opportunity to see them so close to home.  LOVE COLDPLAY!!!
10/3/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Absolutely loved the concert! Loved all the songs played by Chris. I just felt the sound system was not at par with their previous concert in San Diego. Also for a few songs the wrist band (lighting effect) was not turned on (like for Viva la Vida). Not sure if that was intentional but would have loved more lighting around that song.
Overall great experience just a few things here and there that could have been better. Also i am not entirely sure but looks like Chris ended it a little earlier than what I expected."
10/3/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay TOTALLY brought the energy, enthusiasm, fun, and connection with the crowd. But unlike the other three Coldplay shows I've attended in the past, this one was different. Being on the floor was a disaster what with all of the constant video taping by other concert goers around me. I am only 5'11"", and I couldn't see most of the show due to the perpetual video taping of every song by everyone around me. I will not plan to be on the floor at a Cold play performance again in the future. Why can't folks just be in the moment and enjoy the music and the crowd with their own eyes instead of through the screen of their phones?"
10/4/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Although my feet ended up completely destroyed, it was so worth it! I bought floor tickets and was standing (and jumping and dancing) for around 6 hours but I didn't even feel them. They put on one of the best shows I've ever seen live, the way they interact with the crowd is so wholesome, and also (one of the many reasons I am a huge fan of theirs) what they stand for is heartwarming. It hits you all at once, when you're screaming your heart out to songs that heal, to songs that hug you, you can feel that every second.

I highly recommend everyone to go at least once, because on top of all that, the lights and props make the show so fun! Thank you, Coldplay, for everything!"
10/4/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This is a show you must see at least once in a lifetime. Chris and the band make the whole experience very meaningful and with the purpose of giving back - from the light up, recyclable wristbands that everyone in the crowd gets to wear, to your ticket purchase going towards the One Tree Planted organization. The band plays all their classic hits, acoustic versions of some of their older songs, and delivers the entire new album as well. Their love of performing is evident with the energy they bring to the stage and they sound anything but incredible live. Make the trip to see these guys light up the stage- you won't regret it."
10/4/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Everybody should attend a Coldplay concert in their lifetime. Best experience ever. Amazing band, best energy and great entertainment. Still feeling the vibe of that day. Amazing!"
10/5/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,I am from mexico and i always want to experience a concert coldplay and see he was talking in spanich some words it means a lot for me becausr he knos we where in la frontera and living this experience with all the show but mostly was the messege he brouth us the love the sustentability to help the world amaizing i want a be part of this proyect any concert defenitly i will be there. Love coldplay
10/8/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"My friend wanted to go to this concert and then she couldn’t make it! Was glad I decided to take someone else instead of reselling my tickets. 
Coldplay is so entertaining, engaging and they really connect with the crowd. The LED lighting is so enjoyable, sets the mood. Their songs are so heartfelt and non-political. Really had a good time. A truly Magical night!
It was my first time taking the shuttle from Walnut Street it’s the only way to get to the Rose Bowl. 
Only problem is we got there too early and had to wait over an hour to get in. Hoping event organizers will consider to open the gate a little earlier if you are asking the crowds to arrive early."
10/8/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay know how to put on a show. The demographic was anywhere from 50-60 year old to kids. Shows how good Coldplay have been. They’re timeless and their songs brought a lot of nostalgia for me. I felt like they went for like a Disney theme with the entrance music to the fireworks to the stage screens being in the shape of Mickey Mouse hats. People singing along together with not a care in the world. 10000/10
10/9/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The show was amazing! I hope watching them again soon. Coming to the Rose Bowl parking lot was easy and well organized. Leaving was a bit confused due everyone was out at the same time, but in general it was expected."
10/9/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay is an amazing band, and the concert was amazing, don’t have words to express how I felt but it was wonderful!"
10/9/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay was amazing. I have no complaints about them. Their show was out of this world!!!! 

The venue, however, needs better organization. Gates were supposed to open at 5:00; they opened almost 40 minutes later. The entrance  lines were very disorganized. People were cutting in line. The merch lines were horrible!!! They cut across the wakway, and people had to walk across the lines and that was very hard to do. I sure won’t go to another concert there."
10/9/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"This was a fantastic experience, especially for a stadium show, which I'm not really big on in the first place.  My only slight beef was the long line held outside prior to the stadium being opened, but I believe had we not gotten there early (as was stressed via email etc) that we could've avoided the line and walked right in an hour or so later and not missed much with the exception of the first of three openers....Rose Bowl does a nice job of coordinating everything tho. We parked at Parsons lot and opted to forego the shuttle and walk the 1.2 miles into the stadium and again after the show (we beat the shuttles back!). If you're physically able, I highly recommend this!  It's actually pleasant and takes about 24 minutes is all, plus you beat much of the crowd!"
10/10/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay puts on the most unbelievable, heart warming concert so full of love. Music was just amazing. 
The venue does not seem to met code. Tiny seats, steep steps with no railing. 
Restrooms were to few, smelly 
and dirty
Getting to the shuttle buses was a nightmare!!!Hours of waiting."
10/10/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"With so many songs and so many great fans, a Coldplay concert is a great experience. They always put on an awesome show. You definitely will not be bored. Everything from the light show to pyrotechnics to even better songs to sing along to, there is something for everyone. The just get better and better!!"
10/12/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I have had the pleasure of attending numerous concerts by some of the biggest artists in the world, but Coldplay's performance at the Rose Bowl stands out as the absolute best. No one has ever come as close to creating an unforgettable experience as Coldplay did that night.

From the mesmerizing light show to the playful release of balloons, confetti, and fireworks, every moment was pure magic. Chris Martin's ability to not only enthrall the audience with his music but also interact with everyone on a personal level left me in awe. He exudes humility, which is a rare and beautiful trait in a performer of his stature.

The surprise appearance of a special guest on stage was the icing on the cake, adding an extra layer of excitement to an already exceptional evening. I can't help but wonder if anyone can ever surpass the sheer brilliance of Coldplay's performance at the Rose Bowl. Many may try, but I believe most will fall short.

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Coldplay for giving my family and me the best time of our lives. This concert will forever hold a special place in our hearts."
10/14/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Honestly one of the best concert experiences I have been to! The venue and parking was not great, but the concert experience was amazing! If you enjoy any of Coldplay’s songs, I highly recommend attending a concert. Great vibes and better music. Chris Martin is a heart."
10/18/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"One of the best concerts i have been to and i have been to quite a few. It was an experience to remember and i will most definitely be at the next tour whenever that time comes. The vibe, the energy, it was EVERYTHING."
10/18/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The Coldplay concert, like past concerts, did not disappoint.  It’s such a top notch production.  No one does it better.  And of course the energy of the band and music is sooo good.  The light shows and fireworks just top an already exceptional show!  Love this band and music as they are full of Love and share their love and gratitude with every audience member.  Highly recommend if you’ve never seen them live to go."
10/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay has been on my bucket list and now it’s been another check mark completed. If you have been wanting don’t! Do it! They are so amazing live!!
10/26/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"SO beyond expectations!!  Off the chart!!  Coldplay went beyond and above in every way, right down to the near-end by going to the ""other""end of the stadium and playing to the folks there.  Best concert of my life."
6/13/22,FedExField - Landover,"great opening acts.  gave us enough break in between to the real show start.  When Coldplay came out, the fireworks were unexpected.  The energy of the concert from the band to the audience was so lively. I was entertained the whole time.  Vibe of the concert was high the whole time! We had a couple of encore songs! It was fantastic! I can't wait to go again!!"
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Ambianxce was great. Lincoln Financial Field was the perfect place for such a big crowd. Stationary bikes and kinetic floors provided some energy to the stage and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Fireworks and giant spheres made the stage uniquely lively. One of our wristbands didn't work but otherwise everything was perfect!
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This band, their eco causes and support, their music and stage presence, the palpable energy and vibe, the light show, the interactivity of their performance and audience -- ALL WORTH THE HASSLE OF GOING INTO THE CITY! Dancing and singing in the rain has never been so fabulous <3"
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The performance was amazing, the stadium was really bad on organization and to let people in, it wasnt just the parking. They didnt communicate properly where the entrances were. And they did the bag checks and all and then they will say that wasnt your entrance i had my bag checked 3 times and we had to walk around the entire stadium to wait in line for over 30 minutes because they werent checking anyone at some point"
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The lights/sound and playful effects were exceptional. Great and amazing show fireworks, confetti balloons OMG! Like the greatest experience…. My recommendation is that if you are going to their concert choose standing room…"
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The band makes the crowd feel nothing less than greatly appreciated.  The entire show has an energy that you leave with, and the concert never has a dull moment.  Highly recommended."
6/13/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"My 11 year old son, wife & I went to see Coldplay. It was an out of body experience. To the extent that every time I play videos from that night, I get teary eyed. The world would be a better place with more Chris Martin's in it. Thank you for providing such positive vibrations to everyone at the stadium.

God bless you :)"
6/13/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I will forever be thinking about this concert. It was truly a dream come true to see Coldplay, and to finally have them a few feet away was absolutely incredible. I can’t wait to see them again one day, just phenomenal! I really cried."
6/14/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was great, but traffic getting to the venue was a DISASTER. There were no traffic police and  I guess the parking attendants decided to start letting everyone in at the last minute because whatever they were doing wasn’t helping the flow of traffic. Basically, I stayed 5 minutes from the venue and it took me 45 minutes to get to fedex field because of stand still traffic. So I missed 45 minutes of the show. The LED bracelets were great but I wish they would’ve worked for every song."
6/14/22,FedExField - Landover,"I cannot tell you how much I have taken this group into my heart.  My husband has been a fan from the start but ever since seeing them in Melbourne in 2017 (birthday present for hubby) I have been a little in love with them.  Their music and ‘stage show’ (wristbands) are fabulous, they seem like such lovely human beings and thank their fans after every gig.  Who could ask for more?"
6/14/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Best show ever! The lights, the music,  the balloons,  the energy of Chris Martin and his band! 55,000 people meeting in peace and happiness. It can be done!"
6/14/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I will never not be amazed at the level of show they put on. From start to finish it’s fin, interactive, enlightening and pure musical joy. Their words, the lights, the fireworks, the level of talent & their environmentally friendly show should be experienced once. I will go every time I am able!"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"My second Cold Play concert at Met Life!  Loved everything about the experience!  Chris and his band have all this energy which shows in their performance of every song!  Electricity was in the air with the fireworks, lights from the watches, attendees who couldn’t sit down set the stage for the entire night and let’s not forget the airplanes flying over us!  Amazing band which made an amazing night possible!"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,This was a truly once and a lifetime concert that was so unique and filled with energy that I believe all ages and demographics would enjoy.
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Sunday, June 5, 2022 Show at MetLife Stadium:
Wow Wow Wow!!! First big stadium tour since pandemic lock downs. I took my family of 4 to see Coldplay. All the big hits with all of the new Spheres awesome songs in full stadium in fabulous weather! We had standing only floor tickets and had plenty of space around us between the end of the long stage and the satellite stage. We were amazingly close to performances on both stage areas. Bruce Springsteen showed up to add to the magic. The stadium crowd was full of energy, singing, doing the wave, and those lighted wrist bands, fireworks, confetti, laser lights, and beach balls were so entertaining. What's not to love! I took this same crew to Coldplay's show in Liberty State Park in August of 2009. Cant wait for the next tour or maybe this tour again... :)"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I’ve been a longtime fan of Coldplay and have always wanted to see them live.

They put on one hell of a show.

The energy in the stadium is unreal and out of this world. The band sounds fantastic live. They pour their love into their shows and send it out into the crowd and the world.

Thank you for the best concert experience I’ve ever had. Looking forward to many more with Coldplay."
6/15/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The best concert I’ve ever experienced, period. The whole experience was completely immersive, between the amazing wristband lights, the fireworks, confetti, and other visual effects.  The band made amazing efforts to engage the crowd with a local touch through the staging, interaction with individual members of the crowd, narratives from Chris Martin, and even performing their version of the local team’s fight song with a Coldplay flair.  The performance was impressive and soulful, the crowd was energized and fun, which added up to an amazing experience. Thank you Coldplay for a very memorable rainy Wednesday in Philadelphia!"
6/15/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Completely blown away by the music and the show. A real sensory experience! My friend and I had so many goosebump moments that it was well worth the drive. We got the $20 Infinity tickets - if you are even thinking about it DO IT!  A bunch of Infinity tix holders were seated together at this show and just in awe of the quality of the seats and our good fortune.
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Coldplay has been on my bucket list, I was pretty excited when they had a show in a nearby state. One thing is, I will never miss a show of theirs again! I have never experience a concert like theirs. I sat pretty high up, nearly the last row, and didn't miss a beat. They are inclusive, they make sure you're aware that your ticket $$ isn't just for them- things like conservation, pollution, recycling. The lights and colors were just beautiful to watch. And wow- they even showed a list of Credits for their stage crew/ staff at the end of their show. It wasn't just another concert, it was a full music and visual experience. Definitely see them on their tour if you can!!"
6/16/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay put on an amazing show as always, My wife and I met our friends at the stadium to eat dinner there as we had heard about the good food selection that was available. My wife and I and our friends decided to try the BBQ Bacon Cheesesteak that was being hawked when we walked in the entrance. We split our cheesesteak between the two of us. The first thing I noticed was how little meat there seemed to be compared to the bread. The next thing I noticed was the relatively bland taste of the sandwich once I took a bite. Definitely not worth the $15 they charge for this so called sandwich. Once we made it into the stadium we walked around checking out the other food offerings and we saw Love and Honey Fried Chicken and decided to try it. I noticed the signs they had up at the registers promoting the positive reviews that they have received. That always makes me a little nervous as I’ve had experiences where places glide along on good press and nothing else. I am happy to report that Love and Honey lives up to their press. After being handed our chicken sandwich which was bigger than the bun I couldn’t wait to split this with my wife due to the enticing aroma. After one bite of this sandwich I was hooked. This is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. I look forward to eating one of these sandwiches again and I will make the trek to there original location so I won’t have to wait until the next time I am at the Linc"
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Beautiful. Not even the biggest Coldplay fan but we had to see this iconic band. So creative and mesmerizing experience, not a concert, and experience. Cried twice, got drunk. Yeah 😎"
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"One of the best shows I have ever been to.  Great music, great show, excellent sound, and outstanding visuals with the wristbands and the video displays.  Excellent that the band plays along the length of the venue so they connect with everyone instead of just those at the front or on the floor."
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was by far the best concert I've ever been too! The venue was cool and we had awesome floor tickets and were able to be so close to the stage. The entire band walked through the crowd right where we were standing! They played hit after hit and of course the technical aspect of the concert was top notch - cool lighting, kinetic floors, arm bands that light up, and confetti. I am still on a high from this concert. This whole experience was a dream come true!"
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"WowowoWOW. This was a show checked off the bucket list for sure!!!
Chris Martin + his fellow band mates are more than musicians. They're true performers. And man, can they put on a show. They care so deeply about their fans experiences. I knew to expect some pyrotechnics and a sick
 light show, but my expectations were far surpassed. The wrists bands were AWESOME. To look out into a sea of color radiating from the audience... Now that was just magical, and I can only imagine how incredible it looked from Coldplay's perspective on stage. 
Everyone seemed to be having a great time! I went with my parents and husband, and was delighted to see how many families - with parents and children of all ages - were also in attendance together. I have never seen my dad so happy or in his element! I was thrilled. The only show"
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"All excellently well, very good organization and one of the best concerts I've ever been in my life, I would see them again."
6/16/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I can't describe how perfect this night was. I had the best nosebleed seats and I'm so happy I did because I was able to experience the full effect of Coldplay on the crowd. It was the most memorable sing along in my adult life.
6/16/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Received a last minute email about $20 tickets. You did not know where the seats would be and had to pick them up at will call. They were uppers with limited view on the side of the stage. That's fine with me as I've seen them many times and really go to hear them. Well what a show they put on. The energy was off the charts and they sound amazing live. The bracelets really add a new dimension and the fireworks completed the atmosphere. They played all the fan favorites along with a few songs from the new album which I really didn't know the words to. Then as a special treat New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen came out for a couple of encore songs with Chris. Needless to say it was a perfect ending to a magical night."
6/17/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay was amazing. They can throw a show and have you smiling all night. Fireworks, interactive bracelets and a good time!"
6/17/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The whole experience was awesome! The sound, the brazalets and their scene experience. This is going to be unforgettable for all the people that were there."
6/17/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Went to this concert on a whim. Did not regret it. The most amazing concert ever. If you have a chance to see coldplay live. Do it
6/18/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Sound quality for opening act H.E.R. was terrible, very echoey and distorted. A bit better during her acoustic songs, moved down to 2nd level concourse across from stage… still bad"
6/18/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The venue, the show, the crowd interaction, the special effects… There is nothing I would change. Coldplay is and always be the best live performance you will ever see!"
6/18/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I took my HS twins to their first show.  They may never see a better one because i haven't.    Only thing close was U2 Achtune Baby.
6/19/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"Exciting show and entertaining, but it was very obvious those in charge of sound had not gotten out from behind their headphones, because the speaker sound was incredibly bad. I've been to other shows where speakers end up bursting, and this sounded very close to that. Really was a MAJOR distraction to the show."
6/20/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay never lets you down!! Whether you are on the floor or in the nose bleeders, they seem to manage reaching everyone with a great live show!! The light up wrist bands are one of my fave parts!!!"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I will remember this concert for life, Cold Play puts on an awesome show (family friendly, with the exception of a few curse words) and the lights were amazing! Unfortunately the opening acts (Gigi and H.E.R), do not put on a very good show.  I'd expect a bigger/more well known talent to open for these guys.  In addition, the opening acts dragged on for over 90 minutes. I admit Cold Play made up for it, but next time find a better opening act and try not to be 'so' late to the stage."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This was the most entertaining and enjoyable concert I have ever been to. The music speaks for itself, however, the energy gathering bicycles, kinetic dance floors and interactive activities with the audience before and during the show where inspiring! Coldplay supplies their own green energy for the show and sponsors many global initiatives from energy, food, rewilding and environmental concerns. 
We were also supplied with bracelets when entering the stadium which were used to generate an exciting audience light show. In addition, there were fireworks, laser lights, confetti and multi sized/colored balls which were in play most of the show. 
We have all most likely seen some of these things at other concerts but when have you seen all these things during one show in its entirety? Awesome! 
It was hot, no, sweltering! It didn’t matter, I’d come again without even a split second thought. 
Thank you Coldplay! You are more than awesome!"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"genuinely this was a concert that can be enjoyed by anyone whether they listen to coldplay or not. it was beautiful, magical, surreal, everything i expected and much much much more. their live songs were even better than recordings and the way they used lights on everyone’s wristbands and ABSOLUTELY took advantage of being in an open stadium to use so so so many fireworks and everything was amazing. The light up wristbands made the experience so beautiful as they were coordinated by seating section to create specific light patterns and shapes and movements it was so creative and beautiful. Everyone should get to experience one of their concerts once in their life."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I loved everything. Just one thing that bothered me. I had a mini purse and one of the staff guys didn’t let me in just because he said that my purse was too big. I had to return 3 blocks to let it in the car. Many people inside the stadium had their purses and bags with them, even bigger than mine."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,From the moment Coldplay came on stage to their bows- the performance was amazing.  I am so glad to have attended;  i took my grandson (12 years) to his first concert and I am quite sure it will always be an eve he won’t forget.
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,COLDPLAY puts on the best concert ever. Their performance and music is beyond exceptional. Totally worth every penny! Love them.
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The venue was good, the event well planned and of course the band was the utmost best part of the night. If there is something I could say was bad would be the traffic after the show and the lack of transportation. Uber and other apps didn’t have drivers available and many of us had to walk great distances to get to our hotels."
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Every detail was taken care of—a complete experience from the beginning to the end. ColdPlay and HER well-executed. Thanks for being part of this concert.
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay did a great performance in a warm environment; their songs, lights effects and outstanding charisma allow us to watch a great show."
6/22/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"What can I say, simply amazing!! I first saw Coldplay in 2016 when they came to Indianapolis.  I had such an amazing time, I knew I just had to see them the next chance I got.  Went to see them this year in Chicago at Soldier Field, which by the way was awesome b/c it was open and you had a view of the skyline plus fireworks.   Both tours they give you wristbands that light up to the beats of the songs.  They had kinetic bikes and dance pads so the crowd could use and it that helped provide energy for their shows. They are such awesome performers, great songs, and overall a great group of guys.  If you get the chance, go see them, I promise you won't regret it!"
6/23/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Absolutely AMAZING!!!! Emotional, full of energy and vibrant colors. It was my first Coldplay concert and I can’t wait to see them perform again! I could cry just to think about the big deal this was for me and my friends."
7/17/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was truly amazing. Great music, fireworks and lights. The only thing negative  was that it was a little too loud. It almost sounded like it was blowing the speakers at times. I honestly think it would have sounded even better if it were down a few decibels. I’m surprised Chris Martin wouldn't be more sensitive to the volume."
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Loved the venue! Lumen Field had great sound and audible clarity. Seattle is a great destination for fun, good sites and food. Outstanding service everywhere we went. 
Coldplay gave us fans a fabulous night of music, visual displays and genuine connections to the crowd. An organization that is doing good things and sharing the love as they reach the world."
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,We have a wonderful time .I was depressed when I went because I just lost my husband but when the show started it lifted my spirit. I’d been going to Coldplay concert then I invited my friend to go with me so now we are both obsessed with Coldplay thanks again fir the wonderful night . Thanks to my friend Anna fir going with me. Hope will see them again
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,It was once in a lifetime experience. Have waited for this concert for a long time and still it exceeded my expectations. Love Chris Martin and Coldplay
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,An incredible experience! We saw them at Climate Pledge and it was much more impressive at Lumen field. They always put on a great show - well worth seeing if given the chance.
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay and all in attendance put on a show I won't soon forget.  The interactive event was unique and full of value.  They focus on sustainable practice and making the small changes with big impact.  Value written all over this event.  My only complaint is that I waited so long to dive in the deep end!  Thank you, thank you and thank you again.  I was on my way home from 3 difficult, rewarding days in DC volunteering for ACS CAN and singing and dancing with thousands of people with positive energy was the welcome home of my dreams!"
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Wow! What an amazing experience! From the sound, to the lighted wrist bands, to the fireworks, the band itself... just an amazing time. The BEST live show I have ever witnessed. So worth the travel and time spent."
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,One of the best performances I have ever seen from floor ! The light show and stars and butterflies falling from the stadium roof put the whole crowd into an emotional nostalgia.  I will never forget this experience !!!
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay sounded amazing and the wristbands that lit up were fun and brought a lot of added energy to an already great concert!
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The most amazing show I've ever seen, I recommend a Coldplay concert to everyone, whatever age you are. It's an amazing show!"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Simply put I was blown away. 

2 excellent opening acts with H.E.R. and 070 Shake.  H.E.R. had amazing range and dynamism, while 070 shake was a distinctive stoned-trippy vibe whose music sticks with me multiple days after the concert.

Coldplay was beyond wonder though, with each and every song being amazing, having impactful moments connecting with the audience, having us put our phones away. The colours and the lights were without question the coolest part and having that on your wristband helped you feel truly involved. I had an unbelievable experience and I am oh so grateful for being there."
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Coldplay concert was an unforgettable experience that left me with a mix of emotions. But first, let's talk about the warm-up act.

🌟 **H.E.R.'s Warm-Up:**I couldn't help but wonder if she was the best choice for this particular audience. Like many others, I had never heard of her before this concert. Her frequent deviations from the music to address the audience, while well-intentioned, felt a bit disconnected from the flow of the show.

🚀 **Coldplay's Brilliance:** Now, on to the main event—Coldplay. Their performance was nothing short of outstanding. The band's commitment to making the world a better place through their donations and environmental efforts is truly inspiring. Their music, combined with their message, created a unique and powerful atmosphere.

💫 **LED Bracelets:** The LED bracelets provided to the audience were a stroke of genius. They made me feel like an integral part of the show, connecting with thousands of others in a breathtaking display of unity. I can honestly say I've never felt happier during a concert. It was an experience that radiated positivity and togetherness.

🙏 **A Note of Respect:** However, there was a bittersweet note to the night. Some concertgoers decided to take these beautiful bracelets home as souvenirs. I would like to appeal to everyone attending future Coldplay concerts: please don't do that. These bracelets are part of the show's magic, and by taking them, we're not only disrespecting the band but also the hardworking team behind the scenes. Let's cherish the positive energy they bring and leave with memories, not mementos."
