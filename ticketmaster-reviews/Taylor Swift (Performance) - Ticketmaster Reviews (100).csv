1/13/25,BC Place - Vancouver,"Words are truly not enough to fully encapsulate the energy, excitement and impressiveness that was The Eras Tour. Having seen the show on 3 separate occasions (Seattle and Vancouver x2), I never grew tired of walking through those stadium gates; the eager concert goers trading friendship bracelets with everyone they saw, the sparkling outfits that you know took months and months of preparation, the Swift-themed menu items, the spontaneous singalongs...and this was all before Taylor took the stage. The show itself felt more like a fever dream than a concert. The talent, coordination, composure and athleticism required to put on such a production is something that will be studied in high regard for years to come. The set flowed immaculately and went by in a blink, despite it being 3h long. Between the inside jokes, traditions old and new and overall classic Taylor Swift dazzling energy, this was a tour made for the fans, and it did not disappoint. Truly one of the best shows I have ever had the privilege of seeing. I will remember this tour all too well in the most enchanting way. Long Live the Eras Tour <3"
12/18/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"absolutely incredible. the atmosphere & energy in the venue  was unlike anything I have ever felt before. being surrounded by fans who were happy and wanted to celebrate the final show. it was a true form of girlhood. I have never felt safer in a room of 60,000 people. Taylor and everyone involved in this show made everything so magical."
12/17/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The show was everything one could hope it would be. Entry into and security for BC Place was smooth and professional, had no problems getting drink, food, merch, and leaving afterwards. The systems put into place to move folks through every aspect were clearly well considered. Taylor and her crew were just incredible. Words cannot describe how immensely amazing the entire evening was."
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Untouchable is what The Eras Tour is and was! I had the time of my life fighting dragons with everyone that was there in person, and via the grainy livestreams. While I will always always wish that many a bot didn’t get their hands on tickets to resell via third party sites, I can’t help but appreciate that Taylor and her team also offered “no view” seats for the final weekend. That said, our seats still had an incredible view with the added bonus of seeing the entire tour crew in a behind the scenes style way. We sang, shook it off, cried, cheered (1-2-3 LGB), and left glitter on the floor after the party."
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,One of the best concerts I've been to this year!! Taylor will always be amazing at what she does!
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Half of the main stage and 1/3 of the screen was BLOCKED by a light tower and lights. Yet we had NO idea of this when choosing to spend an EXTREME amount of money that we thought would give us a good clear view.
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Just incredible vibe! Taylor and anll her crew are amazing! They put an unforgettable show!
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift is magnificent. She is so beautiful and talented. She has awesome energy and she is a total entertainer. I love her.
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best tour experience even though seats were at the back the experience was the best. Taylor, Gracie and her team gave their all for the tour."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I waited so long to get tickets to The Eras Tour and let me tell you, I’m glad it happened the way it did! Taylor is an AMAZING performer. Such a great show! Cried, laughed, danced, and made memories to last forever! I will never forget this experience. Looking forward to another Taylor Swift show in the future! 10/10!"
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It's Taylor Swift. It's the Eras Tour. So of course the show itself was incredible!!! I also saw her at Levi Stadium last summer and loved it then, too.
The reason for only 4 out of 5 stars: Unfortunately for the Vancouver show, I was in section 455, and there was a light structure on the floor with pyrotechnics on top that totally blocked center stage and the center of the big screen. The only other screens were relatively small and at the top of BC Place. Because of this, me and those around me missed out on a lot. Having traveled from CA and having paid a lot for my ticket, this was pretty disappointing."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is, without a doubt, one of the most extraordinary and iconic live performances of our time. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that blends musical history, emotional storytelling, and unparalleled stagecraft into an unforgettable night. In terms of sheer spectacle and artistry, The Eras Tour is a benchmark in concert history. It’s the kind of event that leaves you thinking, “I was there.” Witnessing Taylor Swift in her prime, commanding the stage with grace, passion, and charm, is an experience that will stay with you forever. Whether you're a die-hard Swiftie or a newcomer, it’s impossible to leave the show without feeling like you've just witnessed one of the most incredible performances ever to grace the stage. Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is not just a concert—it’s an event. An event that celebrates the power of music, the joy of shared experiences, and the artistry of one of the most talented musicians of our time."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Our seats were a lot better than originally expected. Everyone around us were so happy to be there, as were we! It was an incredible experience to listen/ watch all Taylor’s hits with that many fans coming together. There was a shared spirit of kindness and generosity and fun unlike any other concert I have been to. A core memory for sure :)"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,i’ve been wanting to see taylor forever. and this dream finally came true. the seats weren’t fully behind the stage so that was good and we saw taylor a few times. BEST THINF EVER
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Every moment of December 8th is a moment I will remember. Thank you Taylor, thank you Mum, thank you to every person I met who traded bracelets and shared conversations with me. Thank you."
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Every single person I talked to was kind and friendly, and everyone was open to meeting new people and trading bracelets. I loved the music and choreography of the show. 5/5 would go again"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great concert, amazing show, one of the best. Had a wonderful time, glad Vancouver was the last show!"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best concert I have ever attended! Taylor Swift went above and beyond for her fans, playing 3 1/2 hours.  Going to a TS show is probably the most positive experience a person could have.  Everyone is happy, no judgment, people singing along, smiling and having the best times of their life.  I am grateful I attended and will never forget this experience with my daughter and my friends.  She is truly an Icon.  Thank you Taylor for the ERAS tour.  Your fans will never forget it!"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor’s Eras Tour was a cinematic experience. The choreography, lights, songs were all carefully thought out. I only got tickets to one show and I’m grateful to have had that opportunity! The only down side for me was the man in front of me. He was too tall for my own good. At one point he had shifted down his row blocking my view of the entire stage during The Tortured Poets Department set. I didn’t say anything because his wife was having the time of her life and I didn’t want to take the chance of souring their experience. Next time, I think I’ll try and go for front row of whatever section I can get."
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The best concert I’ve been to hands down! Taylor put on such an amazing performance!
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Unbelievable show!  Taylor gives it her all for 3 1/2 hrs. Gracie was also amazing and so talented. Love that we got to see them sing together at the end of the show. Two beautiful confident talented women. Such a great example for young women everywhere.
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,A show unlike any other. Swift is unmatched in the experience she provides fans. Air will be interesting so see where she goes from here
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"My daughter and I came from L
Prince George for the last show of her tour and we experienced a seminal moment in both our lives. Everyone that we ran into from fans to staffers, security and venders we so unbelievably warm and friendly!  I was so happy, myself, that I got to dance (and hard) to some of my favourites: ‘Cruel Summer’, ‘Lover’, ‘Delicate’, ‘Are You Ready for It’ and ‘Don’t Blame Me’  and then ‘Willow’ and ‘Betty’ later on. I love Taylor Swift so I wasn’t too surprised how much I was going to enjoy her.  The real ‘magic’, for me was getting to experience the raw, unbridled emotion that poured out from my daughter when Taylor played her ‘surprise’ songs, starting with ‘New Romantics’. Seeing my daughter, Jorja, exasperated trying to catch her breath as she realized what Taylor was playing and seeing the tears stream down her face, without remission, made me lose all control and I cried inconsolably.  The bonds that were forged between dad and daughter over the entire weekend were made possible because of the flawless show that we were able to attend.  Well done Ticketmaster as well for making it so easy to redeem our on -line tickets. 
Can’t wait to do another Ticketmaster event , hopefully sooner than later; 
Sincerely Ryan McMaster, Prince George, BC"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The Eras Tour was AMAZING! A 3 1/2 hour show with only max 3 minutes in between eras. I don’t think any concert will top that for me!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved the concert! But getting tickets is what was very hectic. Also the prices were very extreme even for other artists not to mention when others were re selling them. Need a better solution and system. The concert though was an amazing experience and feel so lucky I got to experience it. I hope I’m just as lucky to go the next time
3/3/25,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"NOLA N2 was literally the best night of my life. Taylor sounded absolutely amazing, and having Sabrina as a special guest made the show even more incredible! The Eras Tour was incredible!!!!!"
12/12/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Beautiful stage and costumes. Gracie Abrams was killer. Over 3 hours of Taylor including TPPD! Overwhelming!
11/25/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I have seen almost every Eras Tour livestream and this was still worth every penny.  Taylor and her team put on an amazing show that would entertain even the smallest fan.  The show was such an experience that the time flew by.  She knows how to please her fans.  Can't wait for the next tour.
11/22/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Attending Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour was nothing short of magical! From start to finish, the entire experience was perfectly orchestrated. Ticketmaster made the process seamless, and the anticipation leading up to the event only added to the excitement.

Taylor’s performance was absolutely phenomenal. Her stage presence, vocals, and the stunning visuals made every moment unforgettable. Each era came to life with its own unique charm, taking us on a nostalgic journey through her musical evolution. The energy in the crowd was electric, and you could feel the love and connection Taylor shares with her fans.

The venue was well-organized, with clear signage and helpful staff. Entry was smooth, and the sound quality was impeccable throughout the night. I especially appreciated how Ticketmaster kept us updated on event details leading up to the show, which made planning so much easier.

This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m so grateful to Ticketmaster for helping make it happen. Thank you for bringing us closer to an artist who means so much to so many. I’ll cherish this night forever!"
11/16/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was the most fun I’ve had at a concert, ever! Swifties are the kindest, most inclusive , body celebrating group I’ve ever been a part of. The experience is only topped by the amazing talent and theatrics of Taylor and her crew. I will forever be a fan and will do my best to never miss a show tour, even if it means traveling out of town."
11/13/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The show was spectacular! I don't know if any concert will ever beat this. I am still in shock that I was able to see the Eras tour in person.
11/12/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"An amazing experience! Eras lived up to the hype! Taylor was fantastic, on stage for +3 hours and was incredibly engaging. The Swifties were out in force, such a great community; the SuperDome was filled with love and support."
11/10/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Best show I’ve ever seen. Loved all the sets and dancers. Loved going through the eras. Light up bracelet was also really fun.
11/8/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor was a bucket list performer for my daughter and I. Girl got some pipes on her! Not once did she show signs of tiring as my daughter and I sang our hearts out! I've never felt nor experienced so much positive energy in one place in my life! Words could NEVER describe Taylor other than it was a magical experience that you HAVE to be there for! We were there, it was rare, I will remember it for the rest of my life! ❤️ Be prepared for withdraws! Lol"
11/7/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,As a mom my heart will cherish this night for the rest of my life.   It was pure love.   The excitement and joy resonating from every person in that arena added to the insane brilliance of the show itself.  I wish there were words in the English language to do the evening justice.   So I will settle on being grateful for that 3.5 hours with my daughter.   It will stay with us forever.
11/4/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Ticketmaster sucks but I sat in front of it refreshing the page for 2 hours to get my seats behind the stage for $49
11/4/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This concert was AMAZING!!! I had so much fun seeing Taylor Swift live for the first time. All aspects of the show from the music selection to the visual production were amazing. I would 100% go again.
11/3/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Something I wish I could do every weekend. The energy is electric. My sister and I turned this concert into a sister vacation to Nola and it will likely be one of the best life moments for a very long time.
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Loved this venue, it was so fun to see NOLA so alive and small businesses thriving with the ERAS tour in town...AND THE SHOW was a once in lifetime performance from an artist that makes the crowd feel like they are her best audience. Never a dull moment...every song choreographed leaving everyone entertained for over 3 hours!!"
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Nola N3 was truly the best night of my life! Taylor and Gracie’s performances were incredible and words cannot express how out of this world the night was!! I had obstructed view nosebleed tickets, but there is truly no bad seat in the stadium. I would go again and again a million times!"
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We LOVE Taylor Swift! She delivers every single time! Taylor IS the artist of the XXI Century! Can’t wait to see her in the next tour!
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Ms Swift is the best performer out there. This isn’t just a concert, it’s a once in a lifetime experience that I am so grateful to have attended. The most amazing choreography, and obviously her setlist is absolutely insane. I loved this show so much <3"
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I still can't believe we got tickets!!! It was a once in a lifetime chance to see a once in a lifetime show. Tickets opened up on Friday night for N2 in NOLA, and we miraculously got regular priced floor seats! We drove 12 hours back and forth in 24 hours to see Taylor put on the most amazing, heartstopping, emotional rollercoaster of a show. I am still riding the high of this experience! It was my first Taylor Swift show, and I can't believe I got to have this experience!!! So so so blessed and thankful!"
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that left me absolutely speechless! From the very first note to the final encore, Taylor Swift brought every era of her music to life in a way that was both nostalgic and electrifying. The production value was insane—stunning visuals, flawless choreography, and a seamless flow from one era to the next that felt like a journey through time. Taylor’s voice sounded incredible live, and you could feel her passion with every lyric.

What made it even more magical was the crowd energy—thousands of fans singing every word and waving lights synchronized to the music. It was like being part of a massive celebration, with each song bringing back memories and hitting all the feels. The Eras Tour isn’t just a concert; it’s an emotional rollercoaster and a testament to how much her music means to so many people. Truly unforgettable! If you’re a Swiftie or just love live music, this tour is everything you could hope for and more."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It was me & my 8-yo daughter’s 1st time to see Taylor, 1st time to travel w/on my husband & her very 1st concert attendancd. Taylor’s performance was the absolute best - no dull moment even in between Eras & costume changes. She truly brought the house down. I will never forget the experience & I’m sure my daughter won’t either! Thank you Taylor for giving your fans an experience of a lifetime."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We had a great time.  Venue was easy to navigate.  Seats were great.  Taylor never disappoints
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"While I haven't been a certified Swiftie for very long, The Eras Tour has been on my bucket list since she announced it 2 years ago. Taylor did not disappoint with this show and neither did the venue. We saw her in NOLA (which made for an amazing trip on its own) and the Superdome was great. The crowd was electric and we even got a surprise guest on night 2. I danced, cried, and screamed the lyrics to my favorite songs along with 65,000 other Swifties. 
I just wish Ticketmaster didn't have such a monopoly on live events and allow scalpers to get tickets instead of fans."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Wow. and I mean wow. This was my first concert ever, and I had such a blast at the Eras Tour. I am so grateful to have seen Taylor. She has been my idol since I was little, and seeing her in person versus on a grainy livestream? It is a major difference. The energy in the audience was unreal, and just the environment made me feel so safe. Seeing everyone in harmony loving something as much as me made me feel like we were all a family. The synchronized light up bracelets were such a good add on so that Taylor could see each and every one of us. I absolutely will forever treasure being a part of this amazing journey of Taylor's, as this truly was a core memory in my heart."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Everything about the Eras tour was spectacular!! Taylor Swift is so talented. Her sets are amazing and the fans are the best!!
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"For its length and well reported profitability, I am disappointed that consideration and improvements weren’t made to the stage set-up so that people seated on the ends / sides of the stage couldn’t see the main backdrop behind the performers. When viewed from the front of the stage the show is much more dynamic. I don’t feel like my kids or I got the full experience and I paid an exorbitant amount for what looked like good seats online. My kids had fun, but, as a consumer I was disappointed.  That said, I appreciated the positive atmosphere and demeanor of the staff at the Superdome."
1/31/25,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"From start to finish it was a smooth process. Parking was very expensive, t it the venue is great! Taylor swift put on one of the best live shows I’ve ever seen. Her surprise songs were definitely the songs my friend I were showed to get. It was rare I was there. I remember it (or not so) Well"
12/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert was awesome. Great seats. But we never received our VIP box. Very disappointed.
11/25/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The eras tour was an experience of a lifetime!! I’ve never been to a concert like this one! Taylor puts on an amazing show singing some of her greatest hits. The outfits, choreography, and everything is just so perfectly executed."
11/22/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I saw Morgan wallen at Lucas oil and the music quality was eh. I was nervous for Taylor bc I read online that the acoustics weren’t great to performers in there - but Taylor was amazing!! I was in the nose bleeds and still had an amazing experience. The show started on time and it was so amazing and worth the money! Best concert ever!
11/20/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I could never say enough good things about this tour. It was everything my daughter and I could have dreamed of. The fight to get tickets was horrendous, but the venue itself was amazing. The security team was phenomenal, everyone we interacted with was so kind, and the merch stands were set up very well considering how busy they were. It was easy to get to our seats and find the nearest restroom. I loved that because of the demographic, men’s restrooms were converted to women’s as well, I never had to wait in line more than a few minutes. And the concert itself was the absolute best concert I’ve ever been to hands-down, the production is insane."
11/14/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"As a fan of over 18-19 years. It was always my dream to see Taylor in concert! Seeing the eras tour was one of the most magical experiences and nights of my life! The whole experience and atmosphere of being with thousands of other swifties just being ourselves and having the absolute best time! It was a healing moment for the younger self in me in such a way I never thought possible! The kindness and love shown everywhere throughout the concert was incredible! And it was all because of Taylor Swift and her whole team for putting on such a beautiful performance for over 69,000 people! We were so lucky to have gotten to go and if we could we would do it a thousand times more! Just amazing! Thank Taylor Swift for everything and being the most loving and fun person that you are! Being a fan of you just makes life a little easier-all thanks to you and your wonderful team!"
11/14/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I truly had the best time of my entire life seeing Taylor in concert! The show doesn’t feel like it’s 3.5 hours long because you’re just having so much fun!
11/12/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Of course this is 5 stars. No notes. Taylor is the queen of entertainment for a reason.
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Taylor Swift concert was Fantastic and Amazing, of course.  The experience of using Ticketmaster was Terrible - Long wait times, uncertain times of tickets dropping, finally being in the Queue, only to get to the front of the line, here we go, let's buy tickets... Only to be kicked out and told tickets were gone. Then able to get back in the Queue... And the same thing over again. Ticketmaster needs to do better. And needs to weed out sales to scalpers!!"
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Best concert experience of my life. Everyone was friendly dancing in the aisles. All security treated all fans well. Gracie Abram’s was fantastic & Taylor flawless and wonderful, beyond our expectations."
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift was such an amazing experience! She put on a beautiful show and performed for more than three hours! We loved second!!
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It was such an amazing experience finally seeing Taylor in person after purchasing tickets well over a year ago. Her voice is truly ethereal, I would go 10 times over if I could"
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Beautiful performance, inspiring lyrics and embodiment of female empowerment and so much fun."
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I thought her concert was phenomenal. The part that was bad was getting our wrist band to get to the floor level.  Very unorganized and took forever, in the longest line, missed all the preshow. When you pay that much money you should get all you need as you go through the ticket line and not another line."
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Concert was beyond amazing, because she is amazing. Outstanding performance and production"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert started on time .  Taylor sang and danced her heart out.  The dresses and dances are amazing!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,this was such an amazing show! i love taylor so much and ticketmaster allowed me to see her!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was truly the best night ever!! I went to Taylor with my girlfriend's and we had the best time! It was amazing screaming the songs together. I have been a swifty for forever and am SO grateful I got tickets to the Era's tour!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The show was incredible! It was my second time going to the Eras tour. It was way better than the first time because I got to see the TTPD set! I wish I could go again!! Gracie Abrams and Taylor Swift were amazing!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Everything went perfect. The stars must of been aligned for us. We were able to score great seats! Entering the venue was quick and easy. The show was so spectacular!!! The excitement of the whole stadium was infectious! The energy in the room was something that I’ve never before experienced! Thank you Taylor for the amazing show and the memories of sharing it with my girls…priceless ❤️
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I was lucky enough to get 2 tickets to see Taylor Swift night 2 in Indy. I got the tickets a month in advance and they immediately appeared in my account with a count down to when I was able to transfer them. I was also lucky that I was not one of many who got scammed. I received my tickets on the date it had promised and was able to transfer them to my phone right away! The seats were right together, although I was not aware that our seats were against a concrete barrier where people come in and out/up and down the stares. If I had purchased 1 ticket over myself and brother would have been split between this wall. Again I was lucky that, that wasn’t the case and we had the best night ever."
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor puts on an amazing show.  3 and 1/2 hours of music. Definitely worth every penny. Plus Taylor has the nicest fans!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert we have ever attended. The people around us were very friendly and we were trading bracelets and decorated sunglasses. It we just special.
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Probably the best concert I’ve ever been to. My seat was in section 625, but I could still see everything and it was an amazing concert. She really knows how to put on a show and all the people I was around were super friendly."
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert I have ever attended.  The atmosphere was electric and she did an amazing job.  One song after another without hardly a break.  So glad I was able to experience it!
3/18/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"By far one of the best concert experiences of my life, I'd do anything to go back!! It was a magical, fantastic feeling especially after all my sister and I went through to get the tickets and arrive at the concert. I could not feel more grateful!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2/26/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor was amazing!! The overall Eras Tour from the moment walking into the stadium, seeing the stage for the first time to Gracie's opening act and the production building up the excitement, to finally seeing Taylor was an experience of a lifetime. She really put a lot of hard work and thought into creating a special and memorable experience for her swifties, giving it her all performing from era to era. I would have loved to see her perform Long Live but hopefully she will add that ""permanently""to the setlist on her next upcoming tour! :)"
2/23/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,My first concert ever.Worth the wait from ticket registration via Avion up to the day of the concert.Thank you for the amazing experience.
12/13/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"There really is no better concert to see performed live, it just hits different! The energy really makes sparks fly like your wildest dreams. The Toronto Rogers Centre was a great sized venue where even the nosebleed seats don't make you feel exiled. Long live Taylor Swift, I had the best day. This tour will go down like folklore."
12/12/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was unforgettable and worth every penny. There is a reason that Taylor Swift is the music industry. Would love to relive this experience over and over again.
12/7/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What else can you say but it was Taylor Swift! It was the Eras Tour!!! A night to remember forever! One of the most amazing artists who delivers a show that is amazing to both eyes and ears. It was a night that will never be forgotten 🩷💜

12/1/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It’s the only website I use for buying tickets. I was fortunate to take my daughter to see Mama Mia for the first time and her idol Taylor Swift this year. She is a big Swiftie. My daughter said it doesn’t get better than this!!   She was over the moon!! Thank you Ticketmaster!!
12/1/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift was fantastic! The arena was electric with high energy and anticipation as the clock ticked down to the opening. I had tears & goose bumps when she appeared to open her show. I watched the fans around me, of all ages, singing along. I watched the lights throughout the audience and stage, and it was incredible how it all worked together, so impressive! The coreography, dancers, singers were great and they looked like they were having fun. 
Most impressive was Taylor's performance! Over 3 hours of, singing, dancing, playing guitar and piano... high energy & emotion throughout. It was an experience I will never forget!"
11/30/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"We were absolutely blown away with the production of this tour! It was easy to find our seats, the staff were absolutely wonderful to deal with and the line ups were managed well by the staff. What can I say about Taylor? The performance was phenomenal and out of this world! My only complaint was that the drinks were VERY expensive! I spent $15 on a popcorn and $74 on TWO drinks!!!! Woah... Other than that the night was amazing!"

11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Eras Tour was an absolutely magnificent experience. It was so much more than just a concert. I had the time of my life trading friendship bracelets, chatting with Swifties, interacting with all of the venue staff, and watching this once-in-a-lifetime performance by the most talented artist. Taylor is so sincere and genuine, and it's obvious that she puts everything she has into putting on the best show for her audience. I've been to many concerts, but I've never been a part of something as special as the Eras Tour. Taylor's band and dancers were incredible. The stage itself was such a marvel. The entire production of this show was remarkable. I feel very lucky to have been able to witness Taylor Swift perform. It had, indeed, been a long time coming, and I'll remember it for the rest of my life...all too well. :)"

11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Obviously expectations were high for Taylor Swift but the whole event was amazing and met those expectations. Everything was so organized and the staff were very friendly. The only thing I would comment on was that I wish our gate was a little closer to our seats but it wasn’t too far so other than that everything was brilliant.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I was able to bring my daughter this time( my second time seeing Taylor on Eras Tour) and it was such an incredible experience to have with her on her 13th birthday. I am a huge Swiftie, but I feel like even if you don’t like her or her music there is no way you could go to one of her concerts and not appreciate what she does on stage and off. She brings people together and it is truly an experience of a lifetime."
