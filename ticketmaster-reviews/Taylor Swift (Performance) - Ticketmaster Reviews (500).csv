1/13/25,BC Place - Vancouver,"Words are truly not enough to fully encapsulate the energy, excitement and impressiveness that was The Eras Tour. Having seen the show on 3 separate occasions (Seattle and Vancouver x2), I never grew tired of walking through those stadium gates; the eager concert goers trading friendship bracelets with everyone they saw, the sparkling outfits that you know took months and months of preparation, the Swift-themed menu items, the spontaneous singalongs...and this was all before Taylor took the stage. The show itself felt more like a fever dream than a concert. The talent, coordination, composure and athleticism required to put on such a production is something that will be studied in high regard for years to come. The set flowed immaculately and went by in a blink, despite it being 3h long. Between the inside jokes, traditions old and new and overall classic Taylor Swift dazzling energy, this was a tour made for the fans, and it did not disappoint. Truly one of the best shows I have ever had the privilege of seeing. I will remember this tour all too well in the most enchanting way. Long Live the Eras Tour <3"
12/18/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"absolutely incredible. the atmosphere & energy in the venue  was unlike anything I have ever felt before. being surrounded by fans who were happy and wanted to celebrate the final show. it was a true form of girlhood. I have never felt safer in a room of 60,000 people. Taylor and everyone involved in this show made everything so magical."
12/17/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The show was everything one could hope it would be. Entry into and security for BC Place was smooth and professional, had no problems getting drink, food, merch, and leaving afterwards. The systems put into place to move folks through every aspect were clearly well considered. Taylor and her crew were just incredible. Words cannot describe how immensely amazing the entire evening was."
12/17/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"All I can say is wow!!! My city definitely rolled out all the things for the last shows of The Eras Tour. I ended up getting a ticket to N1 from a complete stranger in Detroit. She gifted her behind the stage ticket to a lucky Swiftie🫶 

Getting into gate C was a little crazy as we had to cross over to Rogers Arena and then finally cross the street. The line went all the way back to Pacific. Although once in line it only took about 20 min to get in. 

I didn’t bother with merch as I went to Canada Place a couple of days before. Once I got to my seat I was pleasantly surprised that they had put screens up for the behind the stage seats. 

The overall vibes were awesome and the show was amazing. I’m still in awe and pinching myself that I got to go in the end. Great job BC Place and Vancouver!

Long Live The Eras Tour💕"
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Untouchable is what The Eras Tour is and was! I had the time of my life fighting dragons with everyone that was there in person, and via the grainy livestreams. While I will always always wish that many a bot didn’t get their hands on tickets to resell via third party sites, I can’t help but appreciate that Taylor and her team also offered “no view” seats for the final weekend. That said, our seats still had an incredible view with the added bonus of seeing the entire tour crew in a behind the scenes style way. We sang, shook it off, cried, cheered (1-2-3 LGB), and left glitter on the floor after the party."
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,One of the best concerts I've been to this year!! Taylor will always be amazing at what she does!
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Half of the main stage and 1/3 of the screen was BLOCKED by a light tower and lights. Yet we had NO idea of this when choosing to spend an EXTREME amount of money that we thought would give us a good clear view.
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Just incredible vibe! Taylor and anll her crew are amazing! They put an unforgettable show!
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift is magnificent. She is so beautiful and talented. She has awesome energy and she is a total entertainer. I love her.
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best tour experience even though seats were at the back the experience was the best. Taylor, Gracie and her team gave their all for the tour."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I waited so long to get tickets to The Eras Tour and let me tell you, I’m glad it happened the way it did! Taylor is an AMAZING performer. Such a great show! Cried, laughed, danced, and made memories to last forever! I will never forget this experience. Looking forward to another Taylor Swift show in the future! 10/10!"
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It's Taylor Swift. It's the Eras Tour. So of course the show itself was incredible!!! I also saw her at Levi Stadium last summer and loved it then, too.
The reason for only 4 out of 5 stars: Unfortunately for the Vancouver show, I was in section 455, and there was a light structure on the floor with pyrotechnics on top that totally blocked center stage and the center of the big screen. The only other screens were relatively small and at the top of BC Place. Because of this, me and those around me missed out on a lot. Having traveled from CA and having paid a lot for my ticket, this was pretty disappointing."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is, without a doubt, one of the most extraordinary and iconic live performances of our time. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that blends musical history, emotional storytelling, and unparalleled stagecraft into an unforgettable night. In terms of sheer spectacle and artistry, The Eras Tour is a benchmark in concert history. It’s the kind of event that leaves you thinking, “I was there.” Witnessing Taylor Swift in her prime, commanding the stage with grace, passion, and charm, is an experience that will stay with you forever. Whether you're a die-hard Swiftie or a newcomer, it’s impossible to leave the show without feeling like you've just witnessed one of the most incredible performances ever to grace the stage. Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is not just a concert—it’s an event. An event that celebrates the power of music, the joy of shared experiences, and the artistry of one of the most talented musicians of our time."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Our seats were a lot better than originally expected. Everyone around us were so happy to be there, as were we! It was an incredible experience to listen/ watch all Taylor’s hits with that many fans coming together. There was a shared spirit of kindness and generosity and fun unlike any other concert I have been to. A core memory for sure :)"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,i’ve been wanting to see taylor forever. and this dream finally came true. the seats weren’t fully behind the stage so that was good and we saw taylor a few times. BEST THINF EVER
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Every moment of December 8th is a moment I will remember. Thank you Taylor, thank you Mum, thank you to every person I met who traded bracelets and shared conversations with me. Thank you."
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Every single person I talked to was kind and friendly, and everyone was open to meeting new people and trading bracelets. I loved the music and choreography of the show. 5/5 would go again"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great concert, amazing show, one of the best. Had a wonderful time, glad Vancouver was the last show!"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best concert I have ever attended! Taylor Swift went above and beyond for her fans, playing 3 1/2 hours.  Going to a TS show is probably the most positive experience a person could have.  Everyone is happy, no judgment, people singing along, smiling and having the best times of their life.  I am grateful I attended and will never forget this experience with my daughter and my friends.  She is truly an Icon.  Thank you Taylor for the ERAS tour.  Your fans will never forget it!"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor’s Eras Tour was a cinematic experience. The choreography, lights, songs were all carefully thought out. I only got tickets to one show and I’m grateful to have had that opportunity! The only down side for me was the man in front of me. He was too tall for my own good. At one point he had shifted down his row blocking my view of the entire stage during The Tortured Poets Department set. I didn’t say anything because his wife was having the time of her life and I didn’t want to take the chance of souring their experience. Next time, I think I’ll try and go for front row of whatever section I can get."
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The best concert I’ve been to hands down! Taylor put on such an amazing performance!
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Unbelievable show!  Taylor gives it her all for 3 1/2 hrs. Gracie was also amazing and so talented. Love that we got to see them sing together at the end of the show. Two beautiful confident talented women. Such a great example for young women everywhere.
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,A show unlike any other. Swift is unmatched in the experience she provides fans. Air will be interesting so see where she goes from here
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"My daughter and I came from L
Prince George for the last show of her tour and we experienced a seminal moment in both our lives. Everyone that we ran into from fans to staffers, security and venders we so unbelievably warm and friendly!  I was so happy, myself, that I got to dance (and hard) to some of my favourites: ‘Cruel Summer’, ‘Lover’, ‘Delicate’, ‘Are You Ready for It’ and ‘Don’t Blame Me’  and then ‘Willow’ and ‘Betty’ later on. I love Taylor Swift so I wasn’t too surprised how much I was going to enjoy her.  The real ‘magic’, for me was getting to experience the raw, unbridled emotion that poured out from my daughter when Taylor played her ‘surprise’ songs, starting with ‘New Romantics’. Seeing my daughter, Jorja, exasperated trying to catch her breath as she realized what Taylor was playing and seeing the tears stream down her face, without remission, made me lose all control and I cried inconsolably.  The bonds that were forged between dad and daughter over the entire weekend were made possible because of the flawless show that we were able to attend.  Well done Ticketmaster as well for making it so easy to redeem our on -line tickets. 
Can’t wait to do another Ticketmaster event , hopefully sooner than later; 
Sincerely Ryan McMaster, Prince George, BC"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The Eras Tour was AMAZING! A 3 1/2 hour show with only max 3 minutes in between eras. I don’t think any concert will top that for me!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved the concert! But getting tickets is what was very hectic. Also the prices were very extreme even for other artists not to mention when others were re selling them. Need a better solution and system. The concert though was an amazing experience and feel so lucky I got to experience it. I hope I’m just as lucky to go the next time
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,By far the best concert I have ever witnesses. Taylor Swift knows how to rock the stage.  Plus BC Stadium in Vancouver was an outstanding venue.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"One of the best performances I’ve ever seen. The singing, the dancers, the band, the production, it all was amazing."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was awesome and everything I thought it would be. Taylor Swift put on a great show.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We attended the last Taylor Swift Concert in Vancouver. It was a ""great show""but, it felt more like a stage-show on Broadway - very scripted. Taylor Swift appeared like she was going through the motions, and there was no personal engagement with the crowd. Her comments were the same across the three nights in Vancouver. No comment about it being her last show, rather a general comment about the end of Eras Tour. It felt like the ""elephant in the room""within the stadium - the last show of the Eras Tour, but no acknowledgement of this. This seemed like a running commentary as we left the stadium.

The show lacked the spontaneity and involvement of other concerts. This was dissapointing. She appeared understandably done with the tour. But, perhaps it's lengthiness was too much. I would have been happy with less of a production and more of the great singer she is."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"All I can say is it was simply the best 🫶🏻💕. Taylor, her band, dancers, everyone... The stadium, staff and security… all of it was done so well! An unforgettable night."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Most amazing concert performed by THE best artist of our generation, her wonderful band/back-up singers and absolute top-dancers. Performance of a lifetime!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Attended three Eras Tours and was beyond chuffed to be there for the “Farewell” Era 😢 My life is so much better off for these opportunities 🫶🏻 Money can be made, but there’ll only be on Eras Tour ❤️"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Night 3 in Vancouver. Final show, awesome vibes with an incredible atmosphere. TSwift is amazing live."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was amazing and did not matter where you sat!  The merchandise was okay but they fell very short on the blue crew necks
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Was such a great show and performance! Was so worth the whole experience I hope she comes again! I’d bring the whole family! Everyone who wasn’t a swiftie defiantly became one after the concert
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was a good concert. Great stage, performance. But was more entertained at a slipknot concert."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved this show taylor put on an amazing performance and had the crowd amazed
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The Eras Tour was my first concert. And it was literally magical. The high this concert gave will be hard to compare to now that I move on to shorter/shorter budget concerts. Taylor did a great job! Can’t wait to see what else she will do after she gets the very well deserved break she needs!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I cannot believe how amazing this concert and tour was. I brought my daughter and wife and we will never forget it!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Amazing concert. Fast lines going in and out of the stadium. Food and drinks not overpriced. Great execution!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We were so lucky to get tickets in one of the pre-concert drops to the final show on Dec 8.

Taylor was amazing and the crowd was absolutely electric."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Finding the words to encapsulate my eras tour experience seems impossible but I’m going to do my best because I feel like I have to say something. Like everyone else, I tried to get tickets for this tour at every opportunity. My friends and I were willing to go anywhere at any time as long as we could get tickets, but it didn’t work out over and over again. One last time I registered for verified fan when the Vancouver dates were released. Once again I got waitlisted, but while on a work trip to Toronto I got a text in the airport that I was cleared from the waitlist and suddenly the moment I was chasing for over a year was right in front of me. I surprised my best friend with these tickets for her birthday 3 weeks after I bought them with custom friendship bracelets with the show date and location. Fast forward 1 year and 29 days and there we are in Vancouver for the last ever eras tour show. Everything worked out exactly the way it was meant to and I feel that in my soul. I’ll never get over being about to be part of the cultural movement that was the eras tour, from talking my about every detail of the show with my friends, going to see the movie in theaters, trading friendship bracelets with girls at brunch before the show to spending hours and hours and hours bedazzling a body suit to wear to the show, to finally experiencing it live with my best friends. Thank you Taylor Swift, for existing in the same timeline as me and for bringing the magic and joy of girlhood to an all time high and giving us all the confidence and self worth to exist as our truest and most authentic selves. I laughed, I cried (a lot), and embraced the women in my life I love so much.  And I can confidently say, I have been changed for good."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Getting to see the ERAS Tour on the last night was the greatest experience of my life. I just can’t believe how lucky I am to have gotten tickets. I would 100/10 recommend seeing Taylor in concert! She’s amazing!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was magical! A great show, memories were made! I will think about this for the rest of my life."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Bittersweet but a Taylor never disappoints! Loved every second of it. The costumes, the choreography, the set list, our Surprise Songs, the fans, Vancouver!!!, the list continues…all these and many more absolutely slayed!!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I’ve been a big fan since I was in middle school which is 10+ years ago! I’ve been to every concert she’s had since speak now and I plan to for the rest of my life!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The energy was over the top! Taylor Swift has made an historic event with a show like never seen before!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"getting into the arena was a bit difficult. there were long snaky lines throughout many parts of downtown vancouver. while i understand a large amount of people have to get through a small opening at the same time, i felt this could’ve been handled better, especially since it was the third (and final) night. for instance, a guard was directing foot traffic through cones and caution tape, while stating that sometimes the other gate (gate h) opens up, but she had no idea when it would. when i was about to the front of gate b, gate h suddenly opened, causing a slew of concert goers to rush over and disrupt the coned off line. there were also no lights around this part of the stadium, causing a bit of a safety issue as there are many stairs. i felt the overall foot traffic could’ve been directed better, as this was the final night in the city with the same amount of crowd. i completely understand that many concert goers were uninformed, standing around, causing and incredible inconvenience for those actively fighting to get into a line, but a stronger presence of direction could’ve resolved this issue. for instance, an email explaining gate information, times, and closures would’ve been helpful for those who have never visited the city. clear ‘start’ signs to show where lines begin would’ve also been helpful since may were traveling from all street directions. an appropriate amount of gates open to better control the influx of foot traffic also would’ve been confident. overall, staff did a great job of trying to control the crowd, but a little more guidance would’ve been helpful. thank you to all who made this experience possible!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Thank you, Taylor, for sharing your talent with the world. This show was amazing. Just three hours of non-stop action performed with nothing but love and joy. I am honored and blessed to have been there, and for the rest of my life I will remember it all."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved every moment of the show!! It was so packed though I’m definitely going to stream it soon to reminisce on this experience.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was our second time going to the Eras
Tour. We were so happy to be there the final show. It was just as amazing as the first time we went. A well done show with fantastic energy and performances."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Eras Tour was the most amazing experience. Taylor and her crew put on a truly magnificent concert that left fans changed. It is hard to put into words how phenomenal it was. Truly, I hope I carry those memories with me in my entire life. I’m so glad I got to be a part of this historic and iconic event."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I had behind the stage seating with no obstructions. The screen was right there which was nice, but since there was one screen and it had been programmed to mostly show the backgrounds and supporting graphics for each of the eras, we often didn’t get to see what Taylor was doing. The Jumbotron screen facing us was blank, which I thought was too bad because it would’ve helped us be able to see more of her performance while still seeing the backgrounds."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Thank you Taylor for creating such a loving, fun, and amazing atmosphere. You allowed us to dance, sing, cry, and all share the most magical moments with you and somehow, in this crazy world, all 160,000 of us this weekend, were like family. You made something so huge seem so intimate. You made something beautiful and you changed the world with this tour."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Best experience of my life. I am grateful i was able to get the $16 no stage view tickets at first and i tried again to get “ better “ seats and i finally did! I Got floor tickets and that is what made my experience even better. Seats were amazing almost close to the stage! I am just glad i got to finally experience The Taylor Swift Eras Tour Concert as my first ever concert! Thank you Ticketmaster and most importantly Big Thanks to Taylor and her Whole Crew involved! MAYBE for next time lower the prices a tad more lower.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I think Taylor's concert has a very obvious flaw, especially if you see it more than once. The biggest issue is that it actually ends. I hope the singer takes this seriously and works on it. A concert that eventually comes to an end? Truly disappointing."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,City of Vancouver did a great job on being organized and ready for us. Too few merch sale locations and frequently sold out. Concert was AMAZING! BC Place was ready and organized. Was a fun weekend!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Cannot say enough about the show, it was a once in a lifetime experience!  That said, I know that we were some of the lucky ones able to get tickets locally.  The majority of the crowd was people who had travel to attend.  I wish there were more available for locals to buy and attend. So many people tried and tried to get tickets and were unsuccessful yet there were many we talked to who have seen multiple shows and had travelled to see the last ones here.  
The resale prices were ridiculously high which was also a disappointment. It priced so many out of buying tickets."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I went to the final show of the Eras tour and it was no less than magical! I’m still singing dancing and bringing that energy into every aspect of my life and the world! So glad I went to the Tampa show on April 14, 2023 and the last show in Vancouver December 8, 2024. I love good music!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was an amazing concert. The line ups were massive, not too many health options for food. The merch line ups were insane. Happy to see additional bathrooms available for the extra female attendants. But the bathroom line was still insane."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor’s concert was the most amazing concert I have ever attended, and I have seen many legends over the decades, or Eras of my life. Taylor began on time and never stopped entertaining us for 3 1/2 hours. Even when she was doing quick costume changes we were entertained with amazing dancers and beautiful graphics. The huge screen let everyone feel like we were much closer. It was such an energetic performance, and Taylor made us feel so special for turning out to see her, she loves performing and appreciates her fans. The enthusiasm of the crowd was so contagious, everyone was happy, friendly and kind. An amazing,  positive evening I’ll always remember. What a STAR!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,My daughter and I had the best time I knew it was gonna be a good show but never in 1 million years did I think it would be the best thing I’ve ever seen in an incredibly magical experience
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Literally the best show that ever existed. I have been to hundreds of concerts and have never before attended something so magical. The crowd, the environment, the set, the setlist—it was all incomparable. Will live rent free in my head for all eternity"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift gives her all in her performances. A true artist. The venue was good although the offerings of food and drinks were not great. And after receiving a note that bags had to be a certain size- I brought that size of bag that fit just my phone and credit cards. As we tried to go through the gate I was accosted 5 times by people insisting my bag was too big and would have to check it for $40. I was clearly not happy.  Thankfully the concert was perfect!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The entire concert experience was truly incredible. The environment was safe and welcoming and well organized. The show was just beyond incredible. This was the best concert experience I've had!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"fantastic show. 3.5 hours flew by. The Eras tour will be a cultural touchstone in the future, and I'll be glad to say I was there at the last show."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor is an incredible performer putting on a high energy show for 3+hours with minimal breaks. Her production is on another level. The visuals, sound, and overall experience was phenomenal. This is one of the best live shows I’ve ever seen, and I hope on day I can experience her live again."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"More food options, all fried sadly- the concert in itself a million stars ⭐️"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"From the city of Vancouver to the concert itself everything was amazing! The crowds were controlled perfectly for seamless entry, extra SkyTrains were added for smoothness going home. Taylor is the best you will ever see!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I’m so thankful to have been there at the final curtain call. I wish we had a special guest but it didn’t take away from the absolute magic.

Such a tease when Jan rose from below stage for Fortnight. We thought it was Post Malone for a heartbeat 🤣

The night had all the songs, dancing, merch lines and friendship bracelet trading you would have expected. 💕"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Simply the greatest concert of all time! I don't know how she does it, she is a superhero! Taylor Swift the woman you are!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Amazing. Wonderful. There aren’t words to describe a Taylor Swift concert! Thank you to Taylor and her entire team, staff, everyone involved."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor swift is absolutely amazing live! Everything went smoothly through ticket master. If you have a chance to see a Taylor Swift, take it!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Went for TAYCOUVER N1 and my mind was blown ! MOTHER MOTHERED.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The error is to will forever go down in history as one of the most memorable events that have experienced with my daughter.  The amount of love and light and joy that the concert brought to us is indescribable.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The phenomena that she is, Taylor Swift did not disappoint and nor she would have. The biggest surprise is the with the ease of booking tickets however long you had to wait in the waiting room. Once you get those tickets it’s a feeling you can’t describe. The ground staff handling the check-in to the Vancouver Police Department and all other volunteers thank you for making such a grand show look so easy. Crowd management was at it top notch, no words just gratitude."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I attended the final show. Spent the whole weekend in Vancouver and it was an experience of a lifetime! I feel like I left that stadium having just attended the largest group therapy session ever. I can’t put it into words how magical it was. Thank you Taylor, I will forever defend you against the haters in this world!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We had seen Taylor at the beginning of the eras tour and wanted to see her again after she released TTPD.   That part was fantastic.  However, we learned that our show (the very last show of the tour)  was 20 minutes shorter than the night before and also didnt include a Gracie Abrams duet like the night before.  In fact, my daughter noticed she didnt speak to the crowd very much and she was right.  I understand Taylor was exhausted Im sure at the end of eras, as she should be, but it felt like she was already gone.  That being said, the Venue and Vancouver were amazing.  They put a Taylor lit sign and friendahip bracelet installation all over the city.  What a wonderful surprise!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Being there for closing night was so incredibly special 🫶🏼 I’ll remember that night forever
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert lived up to all the hype. It exceeded my expectations. Taylor is the ultimate performer. The whole experience was epic.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I am in awe of her and the Eras Tour! Ultimate experience of a lifetime
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The past almost two years have been the great for a reason, OUR beloved eras tour. I have attended each of Taylor Swift’s tours through her career, but this one just superseded them all. Attending the tour closing night was an emotional experience, but as they say all good things must come to an end. Thank you to our queen for being a superhuman being and giving us everything since March of 2023. I dare anyone to, “Try and come for her job,” to paraphrase this genius. I love you Taylor Swift and I was lucky to experience this tour so many times. It was indeed the end of the ERAS, but the start of an age💜"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,the atmosphere is like nothing ive ever experienced

12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This show was incredible! Worth every penny. Smooth entry. Great staff. Friendly. Taylor put on an incredible concert. More than 3 hours. Fantastic!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Absolutely phenomenal show! The entire sadium was ablaze with pure joy, passion and kindness!! I will never regret going to a Taylor Swift concert but I would have regretted not getting to experience the once in a lifetime Era’s Tour!! So thankful I was able to get a ticket through a friend to see the 3 1/2 hour performance Taylor gave night after night for a year and a half! She never does anything half way but she far exceeded herself this time! Just an amazing, spectacular show! Her voice, her personality, the detailed performances for each song, the digital displays on the screens and floors, the light up bracelets we are given that flash different colors to the music, her beautiful outfits, her amazing dancers, her talented band, the vibes!! 100/100 Best experience ever and a night I will never forget!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Taylor Swift Era’s Tour was the best concert I have ever been to and the most joyous experience I have ever had. The 3.5 hour long show went by ‘in the blink of a crinkling eye’, and I never wanted it to end. Forever and always a fan!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift was unbelievable!! Totally amazing. Loved her interaction with the crowd!  My $30 ticket did not disappoint!
Wish more concerts were that reasonable."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We bought what we thought would be great seats. Section B6 on the floor 20
Rows from the stage.  Unfortunately due to the height of the stage and very tall people in front we couldn’t see a thing.  Not even the video screen very well.  

I’m 5”7’ and my wife 5”4’.  We’re just too short for floor seats."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Legend. Extraordinary. Once in a lifetime experience.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor was amazing!  The positive energy throughout the crowd is incredible. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I have to say that Taylor and her team worked their butt off! By far the best concert that I have ever attended. We waited a whole year and it was well worth the WAIT!!!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Had a beautiful time w my birthday girl daughter-could not have celebrated 19 any better. Canada was an amazing place. Sad for tm unable to control the bots and the price gauging making it impossible for many.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift is such a class act. She is a fantastic performer who entertained the crowd for over 3 hours without an intermission. My daughter and i had an epic time at this concert. I can not say enough positives about this experience.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Loved getting a verified fan offer with amazing seats to see Taylor! Thank you Ticketmaster for enabling such a great experience!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Eras Tour was everything I dreamed of and more. Absolutely amazing, we had a side stage view and the band was so interactive and made the experience even better"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,We tried and tried to get a presale code and finally secured one for Vancouver through help of a friend. The concert was everything we had hoped and we hope she tours again soon!!!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Such a great show!! Loved everything about it. Was so nice how on time everything was with the opener, Gracie Abrams and then when Taylor Swift came on not too longer after!! Amazing show!!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great vibe, friendly crowd, amazing stage entertainment. Taylor was outstanding and her voice plus instrumentals were insane. Gracie was so good and I had not really heard many of her songs prior to the concert. I would go to any Taylor Swift concert I could again. Would prefer to pay FaceValue for tickets in the future. It was a once in a lifetime event for my daughter and me to share."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"First, I would like to tell that the concert was perfect. Taylor is an amazing singer and her and her team’s performance was impeccable. However, I am very disappointed with Ticketmaster sales, because my family and I couldn’t be able to join any queue. Although there are a bunch of people who can get tickets and resale those for extremely overpriced costs. It is very unfair. Since I thought that Ticketmaster’s register fans policy was to avoid resales and scams."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"ERAS tour was outstanding! Couldn’t have imagined how great it was and how special it was to share the night with my daughter! Ticketmaster could have done a much better job regulating ticket sales as I was verified and could never get in the queues, which was likely responsible for the price gauging that happened to all of us fans!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,An amazing experience that we will never forget. Taylor is an unbelievable performer.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We had an amazing experience from start to finish.  All the details throughout Vancouver, the organization and speed of entrance into BCPlace, the actual concert.  
Gracie and Taylor were both phenomenal.  The visual experience was just as fantastic as the performance.  
It was so well done.  Would not have changed a thing."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We paid extra for floor tickets. Unfortunately, it was really challenging to see anything at all due to the lay out of the floor. Additionally, many people were allowing their children to stand on the seats which made it near impossible to see the show. There were people with signs stating not to stand on the seats walking up and down the isles but nothing was enforced and there were several children standing on seats. I had children with me as well and wouldn’t allow them on the seats which made them pretty upset seeing all the other kids do it, and they couldn’t even see the screen due to others standing on the seats."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Thank you so much ticket master for picking up my email address for the Eras tour pre sale(VANCOUVER) last year … You made my girls really really happy, best day ever to see Taylor Swift concert..they have a great time singing and dancing… forever grateful and thankful for this amazing experience.. thank you again.."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,We had the best time at T Swift. Easy to get in and out of BC Place.  Everyone was happy and friendly and the washrooms were always clean.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Life changing. Saw the ERAS tour three times and wish I could have gone many more. Still think Ticketmaster could do more to guarantee tickets make it into the fans hands, not AI & scalpers. Resale prices were staggering and so many people were unable to see the show because of these sky high costs."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This night was sparkling! No one puts on a show like my girl Taylor! So grateful to be in the Swiftie Community! I was lucky enough to go to the first show on March 17th and the 2nd to last on December 7th and it was truly on honor to witness first hand the growth of the show! Thank you Taylor!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I had floor seats in section B5 on the FINAL NIGHT OF THE ERAS TOUR. Row 4- the dream seats. Center stage. And the professional filmographer almost completely blocked the concert for most of us in seats 6-10. (He was lined up with the main walkway). The only time we got a clear view of the stage is when the filmographer dropped down as Taylor came downstage.

Most of our section were short girls, and we couldn't even see the big screen a lot of the time. Some gave up and just sat down. 

Overall, the Taylor was excellent and thankfully there was a screen kind of overhead that I could look up to for most of the concert! It was just a bummer to have those seats and then not have them be as good as they should have been"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was the concert of a lifetime!  I’ll remember for the rest of my life!

Purchasing tickets however was a completely different experience.  The various drops for verified fans was puzzling as a verified fan I had no access to any of the drops.  Maybe Ticketmaster can improve the purchasing system for Taylor’s next tour."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This was a phenomenal show from anywhere you sat!!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Definitely a once in a lifetime experience! Would 100% go again
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,It was an amazing concert. Glad I went. I don't like it when talent lets the crowd cheer or screech for them for a long time without stopping it. I don't need to go deaf. The wrist lights were an amazing idea. The opening act needed a better sound check. I could not make out the lyrics of her songs. I wasn't the only one around me that couldn't make out what she was saying. While waiting for the concert to start I thought they could of done better with the Taylor footage. I couldn't hear a lot of what she was saying and I did not want to see her in a mask. She looked beautiful and I loved all of her costume changes.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I've listened to Taylor Swift since she released her debut album and subsequent albums since. I called myself a casual Swiftie at best or simply a listener, however, until I went to Santa Clara N2. The Eras Tour profoundly changed my life. You don't realise how many events of your personal or professional life are intertwined and intersect with Swift's works until the opening of her concert, finding yourself overwhelmed with a surge of emotions abruptly. It reminds you she's not simply someone on the other side of your headphones.

I typically only go to concerts at small jazz venues. Do you wave? That feels weird. I guess this is why she wrote TTPD, a masterpiece of her lived experiences—the crowd was chanting ""more"". When she tours again, I'll dance my feelings out again, be done with school (I decided to go back during her Speak Now set at Santa Clara), and remember this beautiful end of a 149-concert run in Vancouver with my friends."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Was lucky enough to see Eras 1&2. Seeing it 2nd time with my daughter -priceless
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Incredible concert! The must upbeat concert and amazing atmosphere and incredible performance.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The most spectacular concert… 3.5 hours long with so many songs, effects, and amazing energy. Surprise songs made it even better!!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"if I could put 10 stars I would, this concert was one of the best things I ever attended to.  I went with my 13 year old daughter who cried of joy the whole time, it was so emotional, I am so grateful to had the privilege to attend, I don't regret the enormous amount of money I spent, it was so worth it. Thank you Taylor for the memories,"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This was 4.5 hours of pure entertainment. Best concert I've ever been to.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was more than just a concert. It was pure joy, safe, life changing. To be with 60,000 swifties having the time of our lives … it’s indescribable :)"
3/3/25,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"NOLA N2 was literally the best night of my life. Taylor sounded absolutely amazing, and having Sabrina as a special guest made the show even more incredible! The Eras Tour was incredible!!!!!"
12/12/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Beautiful stage and costumes. Gracie Abrams was killer. Over 3 hours of Taylor including TPPD! Overwhelming!
11/25/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I have seen almost every Eras Tour livestream and this was still worth every penny.  Taylor and her team put on an amazing show that would entertain even the smallest fan.  The show was such an experience that the time flew by.  She knows how to please her fans.  Can't wait for the next tour.
11/22/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Attending Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour was nothing short of magical! From start to finish, the entire experience was perfectly orchestrated. Ticketmaster made the process seamless, and the anticipation leading up to the event only added to the excitement.

Taylor’s performance was absolutely phenomenal. Her stage presence, vocals, and the stunning visuals made every moment unforgettable. Each era came to life with its own unique charm, taking us on a nostalgic journey through her musical evolution. The energy in the crowd was electric, and you could feel the love and connection Taylor shares with her fans.

The venue was well-organized, with clear signage and helpful staff. Entry was smooth, and the sound quality was impeccable throughout the night. I especially appreciated how Ticketmaster kept us updated on event details leading up to the show, which made planning so much easier.

This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m so grateful to Ticketmaster for helping make it happen. Thank you for bringing us closer to an artist who means so much to so many. I’ll cherish this night forever!"
11/16/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was the most fun I’ve had at a concert, ever! Swifties are the kindest, most inclusive , body celebrating group I’ve ever been a part of. The experience is only topped by the amazing talent and theatrics of Taylor and her crew. I will forever be a fan and will do my best to never miss a show tour, even if it means traveling out of town."
11/13/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The show was spectacular! I don't know if any concert will ever beat this. I am still in shock that I was able to see the Eras tour in person.
11/12/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"An amazing experience! Eras lived up to the hype! Taylor was fantastic, on stage for +3 hours and was incredibly engaging. The Swifties were out in force, such a great community; the SuperDome was filled with love and support."
11/10/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Best show I’ve ever seen. Loved all the sets and dancers. Loved going through the eras. Light up bracelet was also really fun.
11/8/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor was a bucket list performer for my daughter and I. Girl got some pipes on her! Not once did she show signs of tiring as my daughter and I sang our hearts out! I've never felt nor experienced so much positive energy in one place in my life! Words could NEVER describe Taylor other than it was a magical experience that you HAVE to be there for! We were there, it was rare, I will remember it for the rest of my life! ❤️ Be prepared for withdraws! Lol"
11/7/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,As a mom my heart will cherish this night for the rest of my life.   It was pure love.   The excitement and joy resonating from every person in that arena added to the insane brilliance of the show itself.  I wish there were words in the English language to do the evening justice.   So I will settle on being grateful for that 3.5 hours with my daughter.   It will stay with us forever.
11/4/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Ticketmaster sucks but I sat in front of it refreshing the page for 2 hours to get my seats behind the stage for $49
11/4/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This concert was AMAZING!!! I had so much fun seeing Taylor Swift live for the first time. All aspects of the show from the music selection to the visual production were amazing. I would 100% go again.
11/3/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Something I wish I could do every weekend. The energy is electric. My sister and I turned this concert into a sister vacation to Nola and it will likely be one of the best life moments for a very long time.
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Loved this venue, it was so fun to see NOLA so alive and small businesses thriving with the ERAS tour in town...AND THE SHOW was a once in lifetime performance from an artist that makes the crowd feel like they are her best audience. Never a dull moment...every song choreographed leaving everyone entertained for over 3 hours!!"
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Nola N3 was truly the best night of my life! Taylor and Gracie’s performances were incredible and words cannot express how out of this world the night was!! I had obstructed view nosebleed tickets, but there is truly no bad seat in the stadium. I would go again and again a million times!"
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We LOVE Taylor Swift! She delivers every single time! Taylor IS the artist of the XXI Century! Can’t wait to see her in the next tour!
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Ms Swift is the best performer out there. This isn’t just a concert, it’s a once in a lifetime experience that I am so grateful to have attended. The most amazing choreography, and obviously her setlist is absolutely insane. I loved this show so much <3"
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I still can't believe we got tickets!!! It was a once in a lifetime chance to see a once in a lifetime show. Tickets opened up on Friday night for N2 in NOLA, and we miraculously got regular priced floor seats! We drove 12 hours back and forth in 24 hours to see Taylor put on the most amazing, heartstopping, emotional rollercoaster of a show. I am still riding the high of this experience! It was my first Taylor Swift show, and I can't believe I got to have this experience!!! So so so blessed and thankful!"
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that left me absolutely speechless! From the very first note to the final encore, Taylor Swift brought every era of her music to life in a way that was both nostalgic and electrifying. The production value was insane—stunning visuals, flawless choreography, and a seamless flow from one era to the next that felt like a journey through time. Taylor’s voice sounded incredible live, and you could feel her passion with every lyric.

What made it even more magical was the crowd energy—thousands of fans singing every word and waving lights synchronized to the music. It was like being part of a massive celebration, with each song bringing back memories and hitting all the feels. The Eras Tour isn’t just a concert; it’s an emotional rollercoaster and a testament to how much her music means to so many people. Truly unforgettable! If you’re a Swiftie or just love live music, this tour is everything you could hope for and more."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It was me & my 8-yo daughter’s 1st time to see Taylor, 1st time to travel w/on my husband & her very 1st concert attendancd. Taylor’s performance was the absolute best - no dull moment even in between Eras & costume changes. She truly brought the house down. I will never forget the experience & I’m sure my daughter won’t either! Thank you Taylor for giving your fans an experience of a lifetime."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We had a great time.  Venue was easy to navigate.  Seats were great.  Taylor never disappoints
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"While I haven't been a certified Swiftie for very long, The Eras Tour has been on my bucket list since she announced it 2 years ago. Taylor did not disappoint with this show and neither did the venue. We saw her in NOLA (which made for an amazing trip on its own) and the Superdome was great. The crowd was electric and we even got a surprise guest on night 2. I danced, cried, and screamed the lyrics to my favorite songs along with 65,000 other Swifties. 
I just wish Ticketmaster didn't have such a monopoly on live events and allow scalpers to get tickets instead of fans."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Wow. and I mean wow. This was my first concert ever, and I had such a blast at the Eras Tour. I am so grateful to have seen Taylor. She has been my idol since I was little, and seeing her in person versus on a grainy livestream? It is a major difference. The energy in the audience was unreal, and just the environment made me feel so safe. Seeing everyone in harmony loving something as much as me made me feel like we were all a family. The synchronized light up bracelets were such a good add on so that Taylor could see each and every one of us. I absolutely will forever treasure being a part of this amazing journey of Taylor's, as this truly was a core memory in my heart."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Everything about the Eras tour was spectacular!! Taylor Swift is so talented. Her sets are amazing and the fans are the best!!
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"For its length and well reported profitability, I am disappointed that consideration and improvements weren’t made to the stage set-up so that people seated on the ends / sides of the stage couldn’t see the main backdrop behind the performers. When viewed from the front of the stage the show is much more dynamic. I don’t feel like my kids or I got the full experience and I paid an exorbitant amount for what looked like good seats online. My kids had fun, but, as a consumer I was disappointed.  That said, I appreciated the positive atmosphere and demeanor of the staff at the Superdome."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The NOLA Superdome was a spacious and inviting venue.  Walking distance to several bars and restaurants (though not many were still open when the show closed).  Venue served food, water, and alcohol.  Restrooms were neat and tidy.  Venue attendants and vendors were all cheerful and pleasant.  Will return to the Superdome for future events."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The best concert I have ever been too. New Orleans put the red carpet out for visitors going to the show.
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Made memories at this concert that I will NEVET forget! The venue was surprisingly organized, full of nice people and halfway affordable (except the alcoholic drinks!) 

Taylor is an absolutely phenomenal performer that doesn't let a snag ruin her show. We love her ❤️"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The lights, Taylor's vocals, the dancers and band. Even down to the wrist bands, this was such an amazing concert. I even hyped it up in my mind and it still didn't compare. There's nothing like it. I cried and sang along with my friends. Screamed bridges and applauded our hearts out. Lost my voice. I wish I could go again. I don't feel my words do it justice. Thank you, Taylor!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This was an amazing night and an incredible experience. Wish I could do it all over again. The Eras Tour was a night I’ll never forget. 10/10.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The whole experience was so smooth and effortless. There wasn't a single thing that didn't go by smoothly and it was very clear that a lot of thought and planning went into making sure that everything an easy process for the fans and I am so thankful for that. The opener was amazing and surpassed all of my expectations and I will be tuning into her music from now on! Gracie truly did a AMAZING job and I'm so grateful to have experienced her contagious energy that perfectly prepared the crowd for what was to come. Taylor was a force to be reckoned with. She was BORN to be a performer and it's so clear in person. Her attention to detail in each set is absolutely unmatched, from the AMAZING live band to the lights illuminating the crowd, costumes, props, choreography etc. The dancers seem to respect her so much and always seem like they are having the time of their lives. You can tell she has so much love and pride for what she does because it shines through so heavily in all of her ventures, ESPECIALLY this one. She was glowing the whole night and gave us THE unforgettable experience of a lifetime. Words cannot describe how amazing this concert was and I will cherish it forever and always!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,By far the best experience at a concert. Concert started early which I can appreciate. It was amazing!
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Great concert.  Would definitely go/watch again.  Wish Ticketmaster would offer Meet/Greet for T.S.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We enjoyed the concert so much! And we appreciated how easy it was to get in :)
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor Swift is an INSANE performer! She put on the most spectacular show for over 3 hours! No one is doing it like her and she is a once in a life time artist! Already looking forward to her next tour! The Eras Tour is by far the most amazing tour I have ever attended. Fantastic show, backup dancers singers to the lights and backgrounds!!!!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swifts concert is life changing. Its a cathartic experience. It's beautiful! Me and my mom screamed along and cried during her surprise song clean. Seeing so much joy on my moms face and seeing her happy was 1000% worth it. I'll never forget how we felt.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"10/10 experience 🫶🏻✨ wish i could go back! Everything was perfect and the show was completely amazing! Completely blown away by her performance, the dancers, the band, the backup vocalist everything was spectacular! 🫶🏻✨🦋"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Experiencing this concert was the highlight of my year!!  Getting to take my granddaughter was priceless!  Watching the excitement on her face from telling her I scored tickets, to getting dressed, to seeing the stage for the first time, to Taylor coming out on stage was truly magical and an experience we will forever and always remember!!!  This was by far the best concert experience I have ever attended and wish I could have done more!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I thought Taylor Swift put on a great show.  It was very entertaining and well choreographed.  My two girl's absolutely loved it.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,i will literally never get over this night. it was the best night of my entire life!! the eras tour could never be matched with anything else.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Wow, this was the most incredible night of my life, from watching Gracie Abrams performing and crying and watching her sing Risk because it was just so special. Then Taylor came on. It is one of the best experiences ever to see someone I have loved since I was six.  I don't just love her music; I look up to her as a woman, and seeing her up there inspired me so much to work hard and chase my dreams. Long live all the magic we made. I remember it all too well."
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The concert event was well setup for the amount of people there. The town was prepared and very efficient to keep everyone fed and housed. It was the biggest production I have ever seen and would recommend anyone to see her show. My family had a great time youth and adults. Police were everywhere and homeland security so I felt very safe. The streets were closed for walking traffic to and from the event also which was massive for me to see.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I loved everything about the show and the venue. Not only did the venue welcome the Taylor swift fans and Taylor swift herself but everyone was just so nice. The show itself was amazing and there was not one person who wasn’t dancing in the 60,000 plus seated stadium even those who accompanied someone. Thanks so much for a night WE will never forget."
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This concert was nothing short of amazing! My daughter & I had an great time, as did some friends of ours. Taylor Swift has this superpower to make a show more than just a show, it is a full on experience & her audience loves it. I heard so many times, “I wasn’t a Swiftie before, but I am now.” She keeps the crowd engaged from beginning to end for over 3 hours."
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It was the best experience ever, especially for my first concert. Definitely set high expectations. Gracie Abrams, Taylor Swift, AND Sabrina Carpenter. Was I dreaming???"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The Eras Tour is pure fun! I took my 12 yo daughter and we had seen the film and plenty of social media videos to know what we were going to witness. Bit to see it in person and to feel the excitement of the entire crowd is an unbelievable experience.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Seeing the ERAS Tour, NOLA was a once in a lifetime experience with 3 of my adult children and 2 grandkids. Amazing!!!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"There is nothing to even compare this to…I have seen a lot of concerts and this show was an experience. The energy and excitement leading up to and during the show just made everything even better!  Every set was unique, beautiful and magical."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"this was my 1st concert ever and I've been a huge swiftie since 2021, the eras tour was so worth it oh my!!! I can't wait for her next tour, this was a core memory

My daughter is one of the biggest Taylor swift fans and when she came out my girl screamed with excitement than started to cry.  We had the most amazing night and one we will never ever forget!  Thank you Taylor for all you do in showing ours kids how to be a strong independent woman that can conquer the world!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"There is a reason these tickets are so coveted, and after all the hype of having bought them from the pre-sale, the concert itself was so worth it. Absolutely breathtaking, an experience unlike any other. The tremendous effort put in by Taylor, Gracie, the bands, the dancers, the stage crew, the designers, and everyone is plainly evident. Each moment was curated perfection, we all felt a part of something much bigger than us from the very atmosphere in the dome. If you are able to get tickets, consider it an honor! Prepare for one of the most unforgettable nights of your life."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The concert was AMAZING!  Taylor’s concerts live up to the hype and I would absolutely would go again!

10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Awesome experience!  It was organized and efficient getting into the venue, the seats were great, Gracie Abrams was an awesome starting act, Taylor Swift and her crew were absolutely incredible, the vibe of the concertgoers was electric and it was organized and efficient leaving the venue as well.  Incredible experience all the way around! The Eras Tour is a must see!"

10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor gave a phenomenal performance. Her outfits were beautiful and her voice is even more amazing live. There was a stage malfunction and you would have never known as Taylor did not miss a beat. The atmosphere was electric and the vibe was just so good. New Orleans and Taylor combined is my new favorite thing in the world.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was one of the best concerts I've ever been too. It was easy to get in the venue once I had tickets. The concert was amazing i mean of course it was, Taylor Swift is the best."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,OG Swiftie here and NOLA N3 was literally the best experience! We had an amazing time! Taylor makes everyone so happy and spreads so much joy! So glad we were able to attend!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor was amazing! It was a memory making experience. Everything about it was incredible. I only hope to be so lucky to see her perform again one day.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swift did an outstanding job in her concert. She was so entertaining and kept the crowd on their feet. There is not a price to put on a ticket for her. There are not many people that can sing and perform for over 3 hours! She is a legend and full of class. I met a ton of lovely people over New Orlean’s Taylor weekend. It was a great time for making memories with my girls!🫶
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Best concert I’ve been to BY FAR!!!! This was the best night of my life! I’ve been a fan of Taylor’s since I was 12 and to finally see her in concert at 29 years old has been such a blessing!! Hoping for many more!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I’m not a big TS fan, but I took my daughter to both the RED and ERAS (NOLA N3) tours. TS is a consummate professional, a hardworking performer, and brings her best to her Swifties every time. Her show is truly a delightful multi sensory experience, and her fans are the kindest community of people."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Granted, I was a little upset that I was waitlisted for the presale. I can say that I’m forever thankful to my brother who was able to buy tickets off of someone else! The entire day was incredible, the energy is something I fear will never be matched again! Taylor herself, while she may not have seen me or my friends, made us feel so incredibly joyful and happy the entire night!! Thank you to Taylor for all that you do and all that you’ve done for me personally!!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour in New Orleans was the best concert ever. Ceasers Superdome was beautiful and clean, staff was friendly and  supportive. We will absolutely visit again!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The best concert I've ever been to in my entire life. I do not think I can put into words how incredible this night was -- I only wish I was able to go again!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,this was my 3rd eras tour date to see and would be lying if I said it wasn’t better every time. You can be way back in obstructed view or up front it’s amazing either way!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,One of the best concerts ever.  Taylor is an absolute legend and a genius when it comes to performing and engaging the crowd.  Can’t wait to see her again!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was the greatest time of my life. This was definitely worth spending so much (I do wish they weren’t up to 1,000 for a ticket). This was definitely a once and a life time to see this experience and hope people get a chance to see Taylor perform."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Seeing Taylor Swift perform is food for the soul. The entire experience was top-notch, from the pre-sale ticket purchase to exiting the Super Dome in NOLA. Ms. Swift's joy is genuine and she freely shares with all those around her. Concert-goers are treated to more than just a concert. They embark on a journey for all the senses. Thank you Taylor for bringing people together, and for sharing your unbelievable talent with us. We needed that. #13forever. Never stop being YOU."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"SHE WAS SO AMAZING!!! Everything was so thought out and you can just see how much work was put into it! I just don’t know how she performs for so long! 13/13, would ABSOLUTELY see her again."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor puts on the best show. Amazing and magical night surrounded by the community that she has cultivated over the years. The absolute best night of my life.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor is hands down the best performer I have ever seen live. It’s not just the length of the show but the effort, energy, and talent she puts into it. Every detail is meticulously thought out to give the audience the best experience regardless of where they are sitting. Truly an unbelievable show and I’m so thankful for the experience and memories"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I’ve been fortunate to attend two Eras tour concerts, Seattle and New Orleans. And I can say that both shows were phenomenal!! The energy the shows have is  contagious. I truly believe The Eras Tour is a lesson on leadership. Not only can Taylor Swift  engage and entertain her fans to the point where you feel connected with her and valued as a fan. But everyone on stage is also so connected and engaged with the audience that you can truly tell they love their job. For a tour to be this successful and be able to put on >100 shows over a two year time period, is a clear indication that Taylor Swift is not only the Queen of Pop music, but also identifies her leadership skills in building trust and loyalty in those she employs. It is evident from Taylor Swift’s career, that she holds herself to a high standard. She knows herself and her values and has never strayed from who she is. But it is also most apparent that those she employs also take on her high standards, as every show of the Eras Tour was performed to a level of excellence giving Swiftie’s only the best performance possible and nothing less. For such a major company that Taylor Swift owns to all be so connected and model such excellence, shows her leadership style. Extremely well done Taylor Swift! Watching you perform was truly spectacular. I think all C-level leaders could learn a thing or two from you on business management and how to build trust and loyalty with those you support."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I am so thankful I got to experience the eras tour. It was a once in a lifetime experience for me and I will remember it forever. Taylor Swift and her performers and musicians are on a whole different level from anyone I’ve ever experienced perform live. They are amazing.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swift puts on a fantastic show! Merch lines were quick and effective. Self serve concessions with self check out is very cool and helpful
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This show was everything you dreamed of and more. Out of this world experience that I wish every swiftie could experience. Taylor leaves her heart on the stage at every show and it’s such a shared experience with so many fans. I attended by myself, but never felt alone. Between the shared experiences and trading friendship bracelets, it definitely felt like a fandom and I feel so proud to be a part of."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Incredible life changing insane experience I wish Ticketmaster would let us give 13 stars
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor and crew put on an amazing show. Was a little disappointed in the lack of food options at the Caeserdome and that all the smalls in merchandise sold out after waiting in VERY LONG lines, but the concert itself was the best we have ever seen."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The concert was amazing. This was my second time going to the eras tour because of her performance. I wish I didn’t have to end!!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I am nearly 60, and have been to dozens of concerts in my lifetime.  My Taylor Swift concert attendance in New Orleans on Night 3 is without question the best concert experience in my life.  Taylor, her dancers, the band, the stage, the wristbands, the venue, and so much more made for an incredibly immersive experience like none other.  The attendants and Swifties alike were incredibly friendly.  Taylor herself was in top form and exceeded in every way possible from her powerful voice, boundless energy, stamina, and charisma.  I have never had a concert experience so memorable and never forget the memories from this incredible evening."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Seats were great!.. not too high or low so you got an up close view but also experienced the whole show lights, theatrics, and all"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Simply amazing. Not a bad seat anywhere. What a complete showman. Would 100% watch again.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor delivered!!!! She and her dancers/singers had such great energy until the very end. I would go a thousand more times! Only thing was it was very crowded and barely had room to dance but other than that it was amazing!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This concert unreal and I am so thankful that I was able to be apart of it 😭😭 I pray she goes on tour again and I’m able to buy them at presale
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,It was an amazing concert. Taylor Swift puts on such an entertaining show.  I would recommend it to everyone.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"One of the best experiences of my life, worth every penny. I went w my 31-year-old daughter and my 18-year-old niece, we sang and danced and had the time of our lives. The positive energy and vibes at a Taylor Swift show are indescribable. You can't put into words what it's like to attend the Era's Tour, it's something you have to experience, it's a feeling. Wish I could afford to see her again."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I wish The Eras Tour would go on forever! The vibes and energy are unlike any other concert I’ve ever been to!!! 10/10 always recommend!!!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I thought it would have been more of an awe-inspiring show with more lights and imagery. Really was just her singing and repeating the same small-talk she did for every other show. No breaks available and the seating very tight with only one way to get out but with everyone standing and recording, you didn’t want to bother anyone by trying to exit. Also, very long bathroom lines."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"No words will ever truly give an accurate depiction of what this show really is. Taylor’s pure athleticism is admirable. Her teams (dancers, vocalists, band, etc) took it to all new levels!! I went for Taylor because her music has been there for me since the beginning. But I also went alone for healing after the most painful break up of my life only a few months prior. And I got everything I went for and more! I’ll forever be grateful for what Taylor does for those of us that love her and her gift of music. Thank you doesn’t even come close!!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Went to NOLA N1 and N3. Stadium was incredible! Absolutely recommend going to an indoor stadium with a roof for the full Era’s experience. Saw Era’s twice at Wembley Stadium and the sun was still out. Taylor performed her heart out flawlessly every night and the crowds were just as great! NOLA Swifties: thanks for sharing the experience, the bracelets and the love!!! Ticketmaster exchange was incredibly easy as well and stadium staff was kind and helpful. Searching for Canada tickets now! Love, peace and happiness to my fellow Swifties!!! Hope to see everyone at the next one!!!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"There are so many reasons why Taylor Swift is as big as she is, and her concerts are definitely one of them. She KNOWS how to put on a show. This is my second time seeing her on the Eras Tour, but it was just as magical as the first. This time I had 3rd row floor seats that I paid a little over $500 for, it may seem like a lot but I am telling you it was SO worth it. Taylor came over to our section multiples times and interacted with us. Her dancers also were so fun and interactive as well, I got loads of great videos of them waving and dancing at my camera. 10/10 would recommend!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Had the best experience with my daughter at The Eras tour! Definitely the show of the century!! And New Orleans was the most welcoming city for all the swifties!!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I have been to a lot of concerts (big and small) and this has been by far the best experience I’ve ever had. It was a well oiled machine. The production was incredible. She really catered to and loves her fans and I am ready to it all over again.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was truly a magical experience and while I spent way too much on resale tickets it was worth it overall, to me. I felt like a child seeing the Disney world fireworks show for the first time. Taylor is the most amazing artist and you can tell the hard work that is put into the show by all of the performers and musicians!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Loved every second of the show, from songs to costume changes to the dancers and the stage opening up and rising. Super cool!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Thank you, Taylor so a night I will never forget! 3 1/2 hours up there leaning it on the stage for us! So glad I got to see it!!!!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We surprised our 10 year old with tickets at Christmas to see her favorite singer.  This was by far the best show I’ve ever been too and was the perfect choice for our daughter’s first show!  Everything was beyond words!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Great show from Taylor that lived up to expectations. Was at NOLA N3 and was disappointed there was no special guest (Sabrina Carpenter N2). However the VENUE WAS HORRIBLE. Had an overhang in section 104 and could not see the entire venue. But the worst was the moving floor! It was not concrete but a composite decking that was warped and I COULD NOT STAND LEVEL at any time. I was being bounced around and had to hang on at certain points. Not kidding or exaggerating. I went to Guest Services and many others had complained so I was not alone. I ended up standing in the back by the section entrance and really couldn’t see well. REALLY DISAPPOINTED. It is an understatement that the whole composite floor bounce thing greatly took away from my overall experience.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I’ve been able to see Taylor twice and each time is better! Cannot wait to get to see her again and take my daughter next time!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I will never be happier than I was at this concert. It was the most magical experience of my life and I would give anything to do it again.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Such a fun experience she’s absolutely amazing she gives you a 1000% from start to finish the bracelet exchange even going on the plane to get there before the concert you get the experience it was so much fun 🤩 my daughter and I had a blast everyone’s so friendly glitter everywhere just so much fun!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This is the best show I have been to in my 54 years. I have seen some legends! This by far exceeded my expectations! She gives 1000% for the full 3+ hours! 🩷💜🩷🩷
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Not enough words to describe, Taylor knows how to put on a show and I’m grateful I got to take my girls to see her last night in NOLA! Zero regrets, 10/10, would do it again and again!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It’s hard to describe the feeling being in Taylor’s world. It was truly the way the world should be. People were not merely NICE, there was an overwhelming aura of pure love. I have never received so many hugs and kisses from people I didn’t know!  Then the Tour itself - I can’t even call it a concert because there is no word for what Taylor did. It was an amazing artistic  performance with each era bringing a different vibe and unique experience. Every movement, expression, word, costume, and set had a specific purpose. At 63, I have been to countless concerts in my life, but nothing has nor will ever compare to The Eras Tour! I am so proud of my wonderful city of New Orleans for being ALL IN for Taylor Swift. Even the police were trading friendship bracelets! Sharing it with my sister, godchild, and great niece made it mean even more!  Truly this entire experience is a core memory in my life. As Taylor would say, “Most fun I ever had, and I'd do it over and over and over again if I could."""
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The show was spectacular! We enjoyed every second of the 3 1/2 hour mega production. So glad we got to see it in. OLA because the city really embraced Swifties.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Such an amazing experience for my family and I. We will never forget the Eras Tour! Ticketmaster was so easy to use and everything went smoothly.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Insane energy, positive environment, refreshing. Electric. I cannot say enough. THANK YOU TAYLOR"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The whole experience was amazing. It was super easy to get to the concert, easy to get in and Taylor put on such an awesome show. Overall, it was the best night ever."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Loved it so much!!! Had the best experience in NOLA! Such a lively experience and I’m so lucky to have been a part of it!! Really hope I get to experience it one more time 🩷
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras tour team handled everything so well. The show they put on was out of this world. Both Taylor Swift and Gracie Abram have incredible voices and song writing skills!

No thanks to Ticketmaster. Their practices are dated and unfair. Their customer service is terrible. They only care about their profits at the end of the day."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,There's a reason this concert is so famous and popular. I'm so glad I was able to experience it live as it is one of the biggest cultural moments of our generation. Taylor is an incredible performer and the Swifties are an incredible fanbase. The city of New Orleans really went all out and we had the best time!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"She really knows how to put on the best show. No matter where you are in the stadium it’s such a good time. There’s no bad seats at this tour. The dancers were amazing, the set list was amazing, the lights and production was AWESOME! I’ll never forget this show."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Amazing time and security did an excellent job of monitoring the floor and getting everyone in and out quickly.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor puts on a show, an experience and core memory that we will have forever. We have the time of our lives fighting dragons with her. The staff and the dancers, the band, the stage crew, the security, it all : everyone was wonderful."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"No matter how many times you attend, watch the movie, watch live streams, nothing substitutes for the live experience of The Eras Tour. Everything from performance, staging and even the crowd are just unmatched for spectacle."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This concert was honestly one of the greatest concerts I've been to in my life. Gracie Abrams did a great job and Taylor took off with that crowd energy and ran with it! I would definitely go see her again!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor swift was right there in front of my face and I almost passed out. She looked me dead in my eyeballs. I couldn’t have asked for anything more.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was our second time to see Taylor and it only got better! She's an amazing artist and puts on a fantastic, high energy show! And when she brought Sabrina Carpenter out on Saturday night in NOLA my girl was shocked! Thanks again, Taylor, for another magical Eras Tour show!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swift in NOLA N2 was amazing! She definitely knows how to put on a good show! I loved every second of it and it was worth every penny I paid.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Best concert I’ve ever been to! She performed for over 3 hours! Opening act was great! The stadium was organized. Had a wonderful time!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This was my wife and my honeymoon and we couldn’t have asked for a better start to it with Taylor Swift. She did such and amazing job performing and even brought Sabrina Carpenter on.
1/31/25,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"From start to finish it was a smooth process. Parking was very expensive, t it the venue is great! Taylor swift put on one of the best live shows I’ve ever seen. Her surprise songs were definitely the songs my friend I were showed to get. It was rare I was there. I remember it (or not so) Well"
12/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert was awesome. Great seats. But we never received our VIP box. Very disappointed.
11/25/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The eras tour was an experience of a lifetime!! I’ve never been to a concert like this one! Taylor puts on an amazing show singing some of her greatest hits. The outfits, choreography, and everything is just so perfectly executed."
11/22/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I saw Morgan wallen at Lucas oil and the music quality was eh. I was nervous for Taylor bc I read online that the acoustics weren’t great to performers in there - but Taylor was amazing!! I was in the nose bleeds and still had an amazing experience. The show started on time and it was so amazing and worth the money! Best concert ever!
11/20/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I could never say enough good things about this tour. It was everything my daughter and I could have dreamed of. The fight to get tickets was horrendous, but the venue itself was amazing. The security team was phenomenal, everyone we interacted with was so kind, and the merch stands were set up very well considering how busy they were. It was easy to get to our seats and find the nearest restroom. I loved that because of the demographic, men’s restrooms were converted to women’s as well, I never had to wait in line more than a few minutes. And the concert itself was the absolute best concert I’ve ever been to hands-down, the production is insane."
11/14/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"As a fan of over 18-19 years. It was always my dream to see Taylor in concert! Seeing the eras tour was one of the most magical experiences and nights of my life! The whole experience and atmosphere of being with thousands of other swifties just being ourselves and having the absolute best time! It was a healing moment for the younger self in me in such a way I never thought possible! The kindness and love shown everywhere throughout the concert was incredible! And it was all because of Taylor Swift and her whole team for putting on such a beautiful performance for over 69,000 people! We were so lucky to have gotten to go and if we could we would do it a thousand times more! Just amazing! Thank Taylor Swift for everything and being the most loving and fun person that you are! Being a fan of you just makes life a little easier-all thanks to you and your wonderful team!"
11/14/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I truly had the best time of my entire life seeing Taylor in concert! The show doesn’t feel like it’s 3.5 hours long because you’re just having so much fun!
11/12/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Of course this is 5 stars. No notes. Taylor is the queen of entertainment for a reason.
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Taylor Swift concert was Fantastic and Amazing, of course.  The experience of using Ticketmaster was Terrible - Long wait times, uncertain times of tickets dropping, finally being in the Queue, only to get to the front of the line, here we go, let's buy tickets... Only to be kicked out and told tickets were gone. Then able to get back in the Queue... And the same thing over again. Ticketmaster needs to do better. And needs to weed out sales to scalpers!!"
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Best concert experience of my life. Everyone was friendly dancing in the aisles. All security treated all fans well. Gracie Abram’s was fantastic & Taylor flawless and wonderful, beyond our expectations."
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift was such an amazing experience! She put on a beautiful show and performed for more than three hours! We loved second!!
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It was such an amazing experience finally seeing Taylor in person after purchasing tickets well over a year ago. Her voice is truly ethereal, I would go 10 times over if I could"
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Beautiful performance, inspiring lyrics and embodiment of female empowerment and so much fun."
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I thought her concert was phenomenal. The part that was bad was getting our wrist band to get to the floor level.  Very unorganized and took forever, in the longest line, missed all the preshow. When you pay that much money you should get all you need as you go through the ticket line and not another line."
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Concert was beyond amazing, because she is amazing. Outstanding performance and production"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert started on time .  Taylor sang and danced her heart out.  The dresses and dances are amazing!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,this was such an amazing show! i love taylor so much and ticketmaster allowed me to see her!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was truly the best night ever!! I went to Taylor with my girlfriend's and we had the best time! It was amazing screaming the songs together. I have been a swifty for forever and am SO grateful I got tickets to the Era's tour!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The show was incredible! It was my second time going to the Eras tour. It was way better than the first time because I got to see the TTPD set! I wish I could go again!! Gracie Abrams and Taylor Swift were amazing!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Everything went perfect. The stars must of been aligned for us. We were able to score great seats! Entering the venue was quick and easy. The show was so spectacular!!! The excitement of the whole stadium was infectious! The energy in the room was something that I’ve never before experienced! Thank you Taylor for the amazing show and the memories of sharing it with my girls…priceless ❤️
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I was lucky enough to get 2 tickets to see Taylor Swift night 2 in Indy. I got the tickets a month in advance and they immediately appeared in my account with a count down to when I was able to transfer them. I was also lucky that I was not one of many who got scammed. I received my tickets on the date it had promised and was able to transfer them to my phone right away! The seats were right together, although I was not aware that our seats were against a concrete barrier where people come in and out/up and down the stares. If I had purchased 1 ticket over myself and brother would have been split between this wall. Again I was lucky that, that wasn’t the case and we had the best night ever."
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor puts on an amazing show.  3 and 1/2 hours of music. Definitely worth every penny. Plus Taylor has the nicest fans!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert we have ever attended. The people around us were very friendly and we were trading bracelets and decorated sunglasses. It we just special.
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Probably the best concert I’ve ever been to. My seat was in section 625, but I could still see everything and it was an amazing concert. She really knows how to put on a show and all the people I was around were super friendly."
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert I have ever attended.  The atmosphere was electric and she did an amazing job.  One song after another without hardly a break.  So glad I was able to experience it!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Great show fabulous. Taylor Swift is pure talent undoubtedly.
The only issue and disappointment was that Taylor Swift did not sing that extra 20 minutes after 11.00 pm on Sunday show like she did for the Friday and Saturday shows. There were no surprise songs and she did not sing Reputation. I was very disheartened. If she did that for the Friday and Saturday shows, she should have also been fair for the Sunday show. 
But my dream come true to see her live on stage was just mesmerizing. She is still the BEST. LOVE YOU TAYLOR

Yours truly
A true Swifty"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Everything about it was amazing! From the crowds heading towards the venue, the entry process, and navigating the venue, it all went smoothly. I also loved the  additional screens we could view especially sine my 7 year old needed a nap at 10 pm in order to last through the end of the night. I was able to watch the show from my seat as she slept. The noise was INSANE! I am so glad I brough ear protection for my daughter AND for me! Though it was ear-piercingly loud, the sound was amazing. Taylor did a phenomenal job at keeping everyone (all 69k of us) engaged. 
I will say we were slightly disappointed that there were not surprises or anything on night 3 of Indy, which was the final US show ever. But alas, happy to be there!"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift puts on such an amazing show!! Everyone should get to experience a Taylor Swift concert at least once in their life. The best performer!!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor was amazing! We kept talking about how she puts on a 3-1/2hr show and doesn’t take a break! Then she goes to do it three nights in a row! I work an 8 hour day sitting at a desk and I’m exhausted! She was built for this! The show was flawless!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was my second time seeing Taylor. My daughter was in heaven and it made me so happy to see her so happy 🥰.  The show itself was AMAZING!! She put on a great show from start to finish. We were on our feet and dancing the whole time.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I was so excited to attend the eras tour. Got my tickets through verified fan in August 2023 and had been looking forward to it for nearly 15 months. After Gracie’s set, we went to the bathroom before Taylor came on. Unfortunately, my husband passed out and needed stitches and further evaluation due to the trauma sustained to his face. We missed the entire show. I am completely heartbroken and devastated. My husband is okay and that is of the upmost importance. It still stings to have had to sit this one out. Once in a lifetime…I saw some videos from N3 and heard rave reviews. I know it was a great show, Taylor always gives 100% and is one of the best entertainers of our time. Now I’m just praying I can manage to snag Toronto tickets and finally get to see the show!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Not only was the atmosphere of the concert the most supportive and welcoming place I have ever been to, but the show was incredible. From the opener to the visuals, the entire show was so well-planned and entertaining. The dancers were so talented and really made you feel so included. The chants and bracelets added so much. I have never seen a concert like this!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Never a bad moment, never a bad seat, and always an amazing performance! Absolutely incredible and no doubt worth every second! Every act a solid 10/10."

11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert I’ve ever been to. Looked like they put a lot of work into the performance
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This wasn’t a concert, it was an experience. Everything about the concert was beautifully staged. My expectations were exceeded"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,10/10 night Taylor really knows how to put on a show. More of an experience than a concert
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I’m not sure I’ll ever stop talking about experiencing The Eras Tour in Indy with one of my best friends. It’s hard to put into words just how incredible her show was. You could feel the passion she poured into every single detail, every single second and I can’t imagine the effort and care it took to create that experience for us.
She made us feel like we were part of something so special. Indy, thank you for an unforgettable night, and Taylor—thank you for sharing your magic with us! Your fans love you!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert was amazing! She is an incredible performer and continuously for over 3 hours! Our seats were high up but we were able to enjoy every minute!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"There’s no words to explain how amazing Taylor performs. This was my second time seeing her and it was a dream come true to see the Eras tour on the last U.S show. Until next time Taylor, long live🫶🏻"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,My daughters and I were able to finally experience the magic that is the Eras tour in person and it’s did not disappoint! The atmosphere since we set foot in the stadium was something we have never felt before. All staff was beyond friendly. You would think that it might have been a stressful event with so many people present but it was actually the opposite.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,We loved every minute of it! Taylor is amazing! Gracie also was wonderful!! Thank you ladies for an extraordinary night. #GIRLPOWER
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Words cannot describe how amazing this show was. I knew it was going to be great, and I was still shocked at how much better it was than I could have imagined. Magical."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Thank you Taylor and your whole team for a wonderful night of dancing, music, a show, lights and so much fun!! EXCELLENT"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The concert and Taylor Swift were great.  We were section 638, row 21, and our seats were absolutely obstructed.  If I stood up, I could see the point of the middle diamond of the stage, and if I sat my view was blocked by people standing.  There was this overhang thing from the ceiling that blocked our view.  I wish I had bought obstructed view tickets because at least I could have seen a Jumbotron :("
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I was going to this show to take my daughter.  It was the best concert I have ever attended.  I am a converted Swiftie now and can’t stop thinking about how amazing it was.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The city welcomed all the TS fans with open arms and created a safe, fun and exciting city to all who came to town. The show that Taylor put on was amazing, but honestly, that is an understatement. I can't even find words to describe the event. I do know that it will be a concert that I will remember for the rest of my life and I was so happy to experience it with my 11yo daughter. You could just feel the positivity electrify you as you walked around the stadium before the show. It was a safe space for everyone to truly be themselves with no judgement! Lucas Oil Stadium was a fantastic venue to see this concert. The sounds was top notch! I would definitely go back to see a concert at this venue and with 100% see Taylor Swift on her next concert excursion, whenever that is. :)"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Love Taylor so much! She was amazing and the concert was epic. Ticketmaster… do better.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"we had seats in the 600s level of Lucas Oil Stadium and I can confirm no seat is a bad seat at a Taylor Swift concert. The visuals, performance, and choreography were mind blowing and there was not a single person in the room that was not engaged. Ms. Swift put on a performance of a lifetime and had a great time doing it. The care and love for her fans and her staff was apparent. If I had the chance to go again I would no matter what the cost."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I had the absolute time of my life!!! best concert i’ve ever been to. drove almost 10 hours there and back and would do it all over again
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Second Era's Tour show Night 1 was Cincy Night 2 and This show was Indy Night 3.  This show was Fantastic.  Started out with a Brilliant performance from Gracie.  She was an absolute delight and her music is so good still can't stop singing her songs.  Then Ms. Swift adding the TTPD set and felt like an entire new show from before. Vocals were amazing the dancing the band the backup singers all were terrific.  This was my favorite concert EVER !!! I'm sad that's its ending but so thankful and lucky to have seen the last US show of this historic event and already counting the days until she's back on tour.   Please take as much time as you need and we will miss and see you again soon.  ❤️🥰.  Love you Tay. Thanks for everything.  Thank you Gracie Sabrina and everyone else who performed with you special guests.  All the dancers backup singers the Band. All the crew that helped set it all up and take it down and anyone else involved.  Oh and Travis of course keep slaying Brother.   ❤️❤️❤️❤️
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I went with my daughter to the Eras tour in Indy.  It was her first ever concert and my first since Covid.  The show was amazing and Taylor was electric.  I feel that my daughter will be ruined for future concerts if she is expecting the headliner to be on stage for 3.5 hours.   Everything about the concert itself was great (crowd, lights, sound, performers, etc). 

My complaints have to do with merchandise and food.  The lines were long and wait was horrendous.  We waited an hour in one of the merch lines.  I ordered and paid for a pizza and then had to wait 10 minutes for it to be ready.  Those two things combined caused me to miss the opening act.  

All things considered I did enjoy myself and would recommend for everyone to see this show regardless of fandom."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"She is the most talented musician I have ever seen live. I need her cardio routine. She is absolutely insane in the best way. I will never forget this tour. Also, her Mom waved at us!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This isn’t just a Concert.  This is a spectacular production put on by an amazing Woman!  This was My first time seeing Taylor Swift in Concert.  I’ve been an OG Fan since Debut!  I’ve just never had the opportunity to see her in Concert before.  I hope I can do it again soon!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Best show I’ve ever seen, nothing can top it besides Taylor swift again probably! Amazing. Me and my mom had the best night ever"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It has been my dream since I was a little girl to watch Taylor Swift perform at a concert.  The little girl inside of me was rebuilt on November 3rd at her last USA show in Indianapolis, Indiana. When I got the email that I had received with the pre-sale code to access these tickets, I was in utter disbelief that this was real, then actually managing to get seats shocked me more.  The seats I had were a perfect view of the stage and it was truly magical.  I definitely will be on the lookout for any future tours Taylor Swift decides to do because she is such a fun person that loves interacting with the crowd. Ticketmaster made sure that my tickets were safe from August 2023 until November 3rd 2024, and I want to thank them for making sure they were secure.  Without the security Ticketmaster has, I would not have been able to watch my favorite artist on stage.  If you have never gone to a Taylor Swift concert, you are missing out.  It is such a magical experience being there."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I have been to countless concerts in my life. As a former employee of a radio station, I have seen every genre of artists perform.
It This was something I have never experienced.  From the production value, those working behind the backstage, to the crew, sound, lighting, band, backup singers, dancers, to Taylor herself; it rocketed past every bar that had been set.  To feel like you were at an intimate concert while surrounded by 70,000 fans is insane. What a gift to be able to make everyone feel included and special.

As a fan of Taylor’s from Debut on, it was such a treasured moment to share this experience with my daughter, who has been raised on her music.  Wholly worth the wait.

And the fans? Top notch.  Respectful, kind, and overjoyed to bond over the entirety of moments together.  These are truly memories to last a lifetime.

Thank you to Taylor and her entire team.  What you have done is unimaginable.  It is spectacular and beautiful and otherworldly.  Thank you, thank you, thank you."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I think that this night was something I truely will never forget. I drive ten hours and I would do it times one hundred in order to see that show again. She is such an incredible human for performing like that. I really wouldn’t know what I would do without her. Surprise songs. Don’t even get me started…
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"2nd time to see the Eras Tour, and it was as magnificent and magical as the first time. The price of the resale tickets was absolutely gut wrenching, but the show itself was worth every penny."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Great venue. Taylor is incomparable. The Eras Tour really is a magical as you think it is going to be.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Taylor Swift concert on November 3 in Indianapolis was everything I dreamed of—and so much more! From the moment she stepped on stage, Taylor radiated pure energy, and her talent was absolutely mind-blowing. She crafted an experience that felt so personal and unforgettable, making every single person in that crowd feel seen and part of something special.

Every detail was flawlessly thought out, from the breathtaking set designs to the incredible outfits, and you could just feel how much she loves what she does. She gave us an entire night of magic, and I left feeling so lucky to have witnessed it. I’m beyond thrilled for her and can’t wait to see what she does next. If it’s anything like this, we’re all in for something amazing!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,My daughters and I went and this was the absolute best concert I’ve ever seen. So thankful we had the opportunity to be there in person.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Incredible performance, fantastic venue, easy entry, everyone was incredibly nice and helpful. She is an amazing performer"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Taylor Swift shows are amazing! The atmosphere is electric. But one of my daughters hadn’t been before and the seats we had to her 3rd Indy show should never have been available to buy. The announcers box was blocking our view of anything above or beyond the stage so we didn’t get the full view of anything. Every picture I took had that box in it or I zoomed in under it so it wasn’t in the picture. It also blocked the big screen across the stadium and the little screen on the side of the stage wasn’t really adequate. Had they said anything about it being an obstructed view, I wouldn’t have bought the tickets. The tickets said side view, which I was prepared for. Not an obstructed one."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,T. Swift never fails to disappoint!  The concert and venue were outstanding- no complaints!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The concert itself was amazing the experience to get the tickets was terrible. Taylor and her crew had an outstanding performance, the songs with the lighting went perfectly."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift puts on an incredible show. It was an unforgettable experience for me and my 3 daughters.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The show was fantastic however could not see a full Jumbotron screen at all! Bothe were either blocked by the overhead ceiling, Speakers, lights etc. they had smaller screens in our section but were not turned on. Wish this information (ie may not be able to view screens etc) would have been available before purchase of tickets"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,It was a dream come true! Best night of my life! Only regret is not going last summer as well!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I chose to do the last night in Indianapolis as a gift to my daughter for Christmas last year and it was a couple days before my 40th. The crowd and atmosphere were amazing, the venue was awesome with crowd control and security and of course Taylor was the BEST ! She is such a great artist and in person was so worth the 13hr drive !"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,this was the happiest day of my entire life i have never been around such positivity ever. i absolutely love taylor swift for bringing the world joy with her music and making such a safe place for a girls to be girls.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Most amazing concert experience ever. I got my tickets at face value, but they were worth every penny. So good. Swift is a beast."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,One of the best performances and concerts I’ve ever had the privilege to attend. Full of energy and it never stopped from start to end. Truly one of the greatest artist of our time.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This was my first time seeing her live and words cannot capture exactly how I felt. It was literally the best night of my life, and I definitely want to see her again. It was such a surreal feeling, realizing that after months of planning, I finally was going to see my favorite artist in the world perform live. I definitely cried multiple times during the show and found many parts to be cathartic and damn near healing. Taylor has a way of capturing everyone’s attention and holding it for 3 1/2 hours, while also leaving us wanting more. I could’ve watched her for hours and can cross something off my bucket list."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It’s hard to imagine how a 3.5 hour show could be any better. The talent in the song writing, performance, vocals, production, etc is just unreal. If you can go, go to the eras tour"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Taylor Swift's Eras Tour lives up to the hype in every way. Best concert I've ever been to. She's AMAZING. 

The only negative was the view from my seat. I was up high, which was fine, but the center of the stage was blocked by speakers. Taylor performed much of her show from the center of the stage, so I missed all of that. My ticket did not mention anything about view obstruction. With how much I paid for this ticket, I would have expected some warning that my view was going to be obstructed."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Concert gave all attendees the full experience not a bad view. Obviously much attention was given to provide each attendee with a unique view of the show.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Very well organized at Lucas Oil. 70k people in one building, and I never felt overwhelmed. And of course, Ms. Swift knows how to put on a show!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I fought the Great War, and it happened!  So excited!  I refreshed every second, and I scored $49 tickets to Taylor Swift N3 in Indy!!!  It was amazing!!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor is a force! Her show was exceptional!!  I feel so lucky to have witnessed such an epic night!!!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This was the best show I’ve ever been to. The venue was great, merch lines were easy to navigate and all staff were amazing."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor swift was incredible to see in person. She and her team put on an amazing show that was thourougly entertaining the entire time. She is amazing live and I wish I could go again
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"taylor swift is the most incredible beautiful talented performer you will ever see in your entire life. the production value of her show is second to none. she’s the only person who can make a three plus hour show feel like it wasn’t long enough! as long as she is touring, i will do everything in my power to see her."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Amazing show !! The show was fantastic ! The admission process was quick and easy. Sound and lights were spot on. The only issues were terrible long lines for merch and food.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"What an incredible experience. Taylor is stunning and such a fantastic performer. Singing with 70,000 people is something I will never forget."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Personally, I love the show and Taylor, but I wish that there was more video shown of the background/main set that was completely obstructed from view from the sides of the stage. In particular, there was a house scene that exists on the background that was basically not shown the entire show. I only know it exists because of the Eras tour movie. This was a disservice to the fans and to the artist that the visual aesthetics were not conveyed hardly at all to a good proportion of viewers. 
Other than that, the venue was a great location for a show."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I am speechless. No words. The best concert I have ever been to ever. Nothing will ever beat Taylor Swift.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I’m 62 years old and have attended many concerts in the past. This concert was like nothing I’ve ever seen. Taylor Swift is outstanding on so many levels. And then add in the lighting, sound and overall production of the show…phenomenal!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The best concert I’ve ever been to, great performer and great fans. Only problem was stadium was confusing to navigate and staff couldn’t really tell us where we were going. Would definitely go again!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Lights, sound, band, performance, everything was at the highest level of excellence!!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The Eras Tour is a once in a lifetime experience!! It’s beyond your wildest dreams!! I have never felt happier than when I am at the Eras Tour!! 🫶🏼
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best show I have ever seen. Shoutout to Taylor swift you are good at singing
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,It was the most amazing show I've ever been to. The venue was amazing Taylor was amazing. She most definitely puts on one of the best shows and we were so excited we were able to be the for the one of the last US shows
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The Eras Tour was so amazing and I’m so lucky that I was able to go with my friend especially for the last show in the US! It is an amazing experience and the singing (of course) and visuals are beautiful! I wish everyone was able to go
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Everyone needs to experience this show! I could not stop smiling!! You could tell Taylor and her other performers were having genuine fun while entertaining us. It was a dream to take my 14 year old daughter to this show as her 1st ever concert! Definitely made some core memories! Thank you!!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,By far the best concert I have ever been to! Ticketmaster could have done better overall but I’ll always be grateful I won the great war II. We love you Tay!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Eras Tour was a once in a lifetime experience . Taylor Swift is an incredibly talented performer , her dancers and musicians are amazing . The TTPD addition was incredible ! I really hope she tours again and gives this album the limelight - but if you get the chance to go - GO!! Worth every penny"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I’ve been to thousands of concerts of all genres. Nothing compares to this. Well worth the 4k I spent on my ticket as wild as that sounds,"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"words can’t describe how incredible this concert was. i was in a daze after. i couldn’t even believe that i went. even though my seats weren’t amazing, i was still so grateful to be there! if resale prices were cheaper, i’d go again."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Had the privilege of taking my family to this concert. An honorary “Swiftie” through my kids enjoyment of her music.  I too enjoy what I know of it, my kids know all of it. The atmosphere, the energy, the emotions felt during her show were nothing one can put into words. It was simply amazing. Performing for three plus hours without missing a beat, the engagement with the audience, she had our attention from beginning till end. This was not just any event or concert, it was an experience we will remember and cherish the rest of our days."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I've seen some pretty incredible shows with spectacular fireworks and acrobatics, but Taylor Swift's show overshadows all others.  She has a way of engaging the entire audience and reaching the show out to the crowd.  I've seen another fantastic artist engage the crowd in the ""cheap seats""but not until the end of the show. Taylor has a way to make every song reach the top rows and the far away seats.  I'm not what you would describe as a ""Swiftie"".  I like maybe half of her songs, but I had to admit that this show definitely deepened my appreciation for her."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The BEST concert of my life! I’ve never witnessed anything like it before. I sang and danced the entire time! I love you Taylor!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Taylor is a phenomenon!  A force of positivity, empowerment and inspiration to women of all ages.  She is a true performer and gave the audience everything and more.  I will forever be in awe of what she has done and continues to do at such a young age.  She is brilliant.  The show was next level.  She is multitalented and loved by millions.  Her lyrics move me and have helped me through a very tough year.  Seeing her live in concert was amazing and rejuvenating and healing."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I feel so lucky to have gotten to see the Eras Tour in person, a once in a lifetime experience amongst the best fans, and performed by the most incredible and dynamic artist and her team. It’s not an overstatement to say Taylor’s music has literally been a lifeline for me."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Phenomenal. Absolutely the best concert I’ve ever been to. I was so blessed to get tickets. Real, genuine tears. Everything went a lot smoother than expected. I need a walker & was concerned about how that would go. Swifties are truly the most kind hearted people - we are truly a family. Taylor has a stage presence unparalleled - utterly captivating. Though some say it’s too long, you cannot help but want more. It feels like time just stops - so surreal."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The concert itself was amazing, and Taylor is incredible live, but the best part was how it transformed the whole city into a safe and welcoming space for all. Such a wonderful experience and an all too brief glimpse of how the world could be if we would only be nicer to one another."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift was one of the best live concert performers I have ever seen!  Such great entertainment and energy.  So much fun and an experience I will never forget!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,this was the most amazing concert i have ever seen. it was so magical and in any seat in there was an amazing view. my seat was in the 600s and it was still amazing. i’ve never been to a more unique and lively concert in my life. not to mention the entire audience as well
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift is a phenomenal performer and singer!! I have been a Swiftie since as long as I can remember. The Eras Tour was the best concert I have ever been to! I can’t wait to see what she does next when she comes back to touring!! Highly recommend making it to one of her last shows if you can!!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Unspeakable. Wildest Dreams. Long Live. All the words that come to mind after seeing this amazing show! I’ve been trying to get tix for 2 years and was finally able to enter the queue Oct 31 and snag tix, due to being waitlisted last year, for my daughter and I Saturday night :)"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Taylor Swift is one of the best for a reason! She puts on an amazing show, I was incredibly lucky to be on the floor, and it was incredible. The visuals, the dancers, and the sound was incredible. I would go to all Taylor Swift shows in the future!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I can’t say enough good things about this experience, from the area’s parking availability and policing to the generous size of the venue (including the lobbies) to the friendliness of the concessions workers and ushers (all of whom had on TS friendship bracelets) to the fast-moving merch lines to the roomy seats to the actual concert. It exceeded all expectations."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Favorite concert I have ever been to. The all around talent and production value was amazing. It was the time of our lives for the whole family. Would love to experience a concert like that again.

11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I have been to several stadium shows by other artists but Taylor Swift's production is on another level! Attending Taylor Swift's Eras Tour was an unforgettable experience that left me in awe. From the moment she stepped on stage, I was completely captivated by the energy and emotion she brought to each song. The way she seamlessly transitioned through her musical eras, from ""Fearless""to ""Midnights,""made me feel like I was on a journey through her life. The visuals were stunning, and I loved how each era had its own unique vibe and choreography. Singing along with thousands of fellow fans created an incredible sense of community. This concert wasn’t just a show; it was a celebration of music and memories that I’ll cherish forever."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"great seats, great show!! second time seeing her and it was just as amazing as the first!!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Amazing spectacular.  What an amazing artist.  Her stamina is unbelievable.  What a rush, it was worth every penny!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This concert was the most magical experience of my entire life. There was no bad moment during the concert. I would definitely recommend it.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was an AMAZING experience!  The Eras Tour was incredible and the entire set up in Indianapolis was perfect.  I stayed at a hotel walking distance from the stadium and that was perfect.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Seeing the Eras Tour was truly one of the best experiences of my life. Taylor put on an incredible performance and it will be an event I remember forever.
3/18/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"By far one of the best concert experiences of my life, I'd do anything to go back!! It was a magical, fantastic feeling especially after all my sister and I went through to get the tickets and arrive at the concert. I could not feel more grateful!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2/26/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor was amazing!! The overall Eras Tour from the moment walking into the stadium, seeing the stage for the first time to Gracie's opening act and the production building up the excitement, to finally seeing Taylor was an experience of a lifetime. She really put a lot of hard work and thought into creating a special and memorable experience for her swifties, giving it her all performing from era to era. I would have loved to see her perform Long Live but hopefully she will add that ""permanently""to the setlist on her next upcoming tour! :)"
2/23/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,My first concert ever.Worth the wait from ticket registration via Avion up to the day of the concert.Thank you for the amazing experience.
12/13/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"There really is no better concert to see performed live, it just hits different! The energy really makes sparks fly like your wildest dreams. The Toronto Rogers Centre was a great sized venue where even the nosebleed seats don't make you feel exiled. Long live Taylor Swift, I had the best day. This tour will go down like folklore."
12/12/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was unforgettable and worth every penny. There is a reason that Taylor Swift is the music industry. Would love to relive this experience over and over again.

12/1/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It’s the only website I use for buying tickets. I was fortunate to take my daughter to see Mama Mia for the first time and her idol Taylor Swift this year. She is a big Swiftie. My daughter said it doesn’t get better than this!!   She was over the moon!! Thank you Ticketmaster!!
12/1/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift was fantastic! The arena was electric with high energy and anticipation as the clock ticked down to the opening. I had tears & goose bumps when she appeared to open her show. I watched the fans around me, of all ages, singing along. I watched the lights throughout the audience and stage, and it was incredible how it all worked together, so impressive! The coreography, dancers, singers were great and they looked like they were having fun. 
Most impressive was Taylor's performance! Over 3 hours of, singing, dancing, playing guitar and piano... high energy & emotion throughout. It was an experience I will never forget!"
11/30/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"We were absolutely blown away with the production of this tour! It was easy to find our seats, the staff were absolutely wonderful to deal with and the line ups were managed well by the staff. What can I say about Taylor? The performance was phenomenal and out of this world! My only complaint was that the drinks were VERY expensive! I spent $15 on a popcorn and $74 on TWO drinks!!!! Woah... Other than that the night was amazing!"
11/30/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Once in a lifetime experience. The greatest show I’ve ever seen. Taylor is incredible.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"oh my god. can't even describe how special and amazing that concert was. guys if you have the opportunity to see the last shows of her tour, DO IT! money comes back around but this tour and the memories with it never will.. thank you taylor for everything you've done to make it unforgettable ❤️"
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The effects were crazy and she was so amazing and from whatever seat you were in you could see clearly from the screen.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Eras Tour was an absolutely magnificent experience. It was so much more than just a concert. I had the time of my life trading friendship bracelets, chatting with Swifties, interacting with all of the venue staff, and watching this once-in-a-lifetime performance by the most talented artist. Taylor is so sincere and genuine, and it's obvious that she puts everything she has into putting on the best show for her audience. I've been to many concerts, but I've never been a part of something as special as the Eras Tour. Taylor's band and dancers were incredible. The stage itself was such a marvel. The entire production of this show was remarkable. I feel very lucky to have been able to witness Taylor Swift perform. It had, indeed, been a long time coming, and I'll remember it for the rest of my life...all too well. :)"
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor was AMAZING NO words BEST concert ever!!!   Hats off to Roger’s Centre well organized.  Staff very friendly, on time. Well done Toronto.  Came from Montreal."
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Wow, such an amazing show!!! So glad we had the chance to experience the Eras Tour. It absolutely lived up to the hype. Taylor is an incredible performer… the energy was incredible from start to finish. Gracie was fantastic as well to get things started!"
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Obviously expectations were high for Taylor Swift but the whole event was amazing and met those expectations. Everything was so organized and the staff were very friendly. The only thing I would comment on was that I wish our gate was a little closer to our seats but it wasn’t too far so other than that everything was brilliant.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I was able to bring my daughter this time( my second time seeing Taylor on Eras Tour) and it was such an incredible experience to have with her on her 13th birthday. I am a huge Swiftie, but I feel like even if you don’t like her or her music there is no way you could go to one of her concerts and not appreciate what she does on stage and off. She brings people together and it is truly an experience of a lifetime."
11/28/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The most incredible show I’ve ever experienced. I need to go again. She sounded so good and did an amazing job. Still cannot stop thinking about it.
11/28/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"this concert was the best concert I’ve been to and I saw a lot of good pop girlies this year like olivia Rodrigo and tate mcrae, and much more and it was everything thing I needed to be and I miss it so much I love you so much taylor you NEVER disappoint :)"
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I had an Eras Tour ticket transferred from a friend, and the process was incredibly smooth and secure. It showed up in my account instantly, and getting into the venue was seamless."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The best show I have ever seen, in 2024 I saw over 30 artists but Taylor was definitely the most memorable!!!"
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I had the best time seeing Taylor Swift! She is a spectacular performer and the energy in the room was insane. Some of the most happiest moments of my life occurred at Taylor Swift. A truly unforgettable experience!
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What an amazing artist and performance, if you can some how manage to go.. then do it! Be aware that you will become an instant 'Swiftie' after seeing the Eras Tour.

I do wish that Ticketmaster was more regulated and that surge pricing/ and the resales of tickets for 10 times the original price were not able to occur.  This would prevent the hacking and scamming that follows suit.  I was so stressed out about potentially have my tickets hacked from my account.  None of that would have to occur if TM wasn't allowed to inflate the prices and or allow the resellers to do the same."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"One of the best concerts I’ve ever seen! The set design, the music, the dancing, all of it was easily one of the best concerts I’ve ever seen."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was the best concert I’ve ever been to and the best I’ll ever go to. Taylor Swift is the whole package, and I think I’ll be in a post-Eras Tour depression for a very long time."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This concert experience was amazing!! Everything was perfect except there was an obstructed view which we were not aware of until we arrived at our seats. But Taylors performance was so amazing!!!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a moment in time! This Taylor Swift show was incredible from the opening act to the last lyrics sung! An unforgettable performance with the highest quality delivery! WOW! When does she return?…
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was amazing, magical!!   So grateful to have the chance to attend!
Something needs to be done about ticketing & resellers.  Two empty seats in front of me for such a high demand event.. Shocking!!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The entire night was amazing! No lines waiting outside to get into the event great flow! When inside the vibe was great! So much happiness in one place! Both Gracie and Taylor put on amazing performances! Taylor sang her heart out for hours and entertained the audience the entire time! Best night, best concert EVER!!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was absolutely amazing. However, I could not see Taylor Swift for more than half of the concert. I was in section 534 and it was not noted as an obstructed view. She and her dancers were often hidden by the tower. It was such a disappointment and I would not have picked these seats had they been identified as an obstructed view."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was a once in a lifetime show! It was amazing. Taylor and her team know how to entertain. Every detail was carefully and thoughtfully planned out.
The venue was good, and everything went smoothly! Cannot recommend this show enough!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a great night I think this concert was even better than the last one I went to on the eras tour . Great stadium!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Awesome event. Made my daughter’ birthday!! Beautiful sets. Amazing choreography. Taylor spent max three minutes to change between eras. That’s some coordination!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Once in a lifetime experience! It was incredible! The performance, the ambiance and everything was excellent!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Great entrance arrangement, easy entry, found seats easily, performance was spectacular, best event I have ever gone too. Liked the interm performances during outfit changes. Taylor did the stage walk (stage was huge with sections that lifted) so everyone got a closer look. Huge screen meant you saw everything even if they were facing the opposite direction. Huge thank you to everyone involved."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The concert was amazing and Taylor is incredible! Gracie was awesome as well. My daughter had the best night of her life
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was such an emotional experience for me! Being in the audience with so many fans and singing my heart out was such an incredible feeling.  TS is such an amazing artist and everything about her stage presence, the choreography with the dancers,  and the stage design is perfectly thought out. I feel so lucky to have been a part of the ERA’s tour experience."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor swift is an amazing performer. i love her. She deserves every award. amazing tour. i felt so safe with security.
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Best concert ever. Venue was super organized and no bathroom lines. Could not ask for a better performance!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I had one of the best nights of my life at The Eras Tour Night 5 at Rogers Centre! Everything ran smoothly, staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Everything was fantastic including the show itself - no other concert will ever come close to this one! Absolutely amazing show put off my Taylor and her team! I wish I could have gone to all 6 nights!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor never disappoints, her concert is nothing short of spectacular. Roger’s Centre did a great job with signage, directing people and were very friendly. I can’t wait to see her again!!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This experience was amazing. Aside from me having major anxiety over getting a presale code/tickets for this concert, everything was amazing! We had the best night and everything was better than I could’ve imagined. So wish I could go again!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor has the BEST concert ever. Ticketmaster needs to figure out their resale problem though because getting tickets was ridiculous
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Amazing. Wonderful. Emotional.
Words aren't enough. It is in the heart and soul."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I have been to two different eras tour shows, if never gets old."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Had an amazing experience!  No issues at all !  Can't wait to go to another concert!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What a great performance by Taylor Swift.  The lights, sounds, pyrotechnics, dancing, imagery and videos.  It was the caliber of show you would expect and won't be disappointed."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I saw the Eras tour in LA and it was amazing. Something about Toronto and the changes to her concert, made this one even better. Can’t believe this tour is about to end, what a ride!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor is personally my favourite singer and has been since I was a kid. She was amazing, everything about that concert was beautiful. Her voice really was magical, and it was legendary. I’m so grateful and lucky I got to go, and I would not trade that day for anything else in this world. Love you Taylor❤️"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"So lovely to be with my daughters and granddaughter in attendance. The concert was timely, organized, secure and safe, no massive line-ups anywhere. It was a wonderful experience."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,One of the best nights of my life. But can you lower ticket prices for all concerts. Like. Dang
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This was the show of the century. We bought obstructed view tickets and ended up being moved closed to the floor. A perfect night. I remember it all too well
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It had been a long time comin….we miraculously got tickets and waited over a year for the concert of a lifetime! It did not disappoint. I went with my mom and two daughters and to say it is a core life memory for all of us, is an understatement! We loved every second! From Gracie opening, to Karma confetti, the entire night was incredible! I’d give anything to go again!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Truly the best experience ever - Taylor Swift puts on a bigger than life show that is worth every penny and then some! If you only go to one concert this decade, the Era’s Tour is the one not to miss! Our whole family enjoyed every moment of the evening and can’t wait to see what’s next for Taylor… 3.5 hours flew by in the blink of an eye!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was the most amazing experience of my life. If you have the chance to see your favorite artist do it! You will never regret it!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I mean come on…it’s Taylor swift. She is the best and she is doing it the best right now. It’s an experience not just a concert. Ticketmaster should have made it easier for more people to get tickets but it was the best I’ve ever been to
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,the best show I have ever seen I’ve been a huge Taylor Swift fan almost my entire life and getting eras tour tickets well it was no small feat it was worth the wait time and effort. Everything in the show was truly amazing and honestly a spectacle ! From the opening to the closing everything was perfectly on point and nothing felt out of place or boring from era to era the show was phenomenal. Even for someone who isn’t a big Taylor fan would still probably love this show ! The energy of the audience was amazing though and through
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was the best night of my lifeee! I would love to go to Vancouver but didn’t get access
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a force to be reckon with. The joy and girlhood that she brings to a place when she comes is truly remarkable. The performance is at a Michael Jackson level of entertainment. The best to do it ever without a doubt.
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The Eras Tour was hands down the best concert I ever went to. She is so generous with her time. Over 3 hours of top notch performances.
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I went to the Eras Tour and had the best time ever! Genuinely had so much fun and I don’t think any seat in the stadium was bad! I was in the nosebleeds and could still see very well! Would definitely go to this concert again!!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Amazing environment, impeccable sound quality, amazing production. Taylor was flawless. I had the best time!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I took my 3 daughter to see thier 1st Taylor Swift concert and her show was AMAZING!  My daughters had the BEST time EVER.  As a parent, seeing how happy they were made my whole night.  She puts on an incredible show.  Highly recommend to all even if you are not a swifty....you will leave with a new level of respect for the artist that she is and the show is very entertaining."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Amazing stage presence, had so much fun, Taylor Swift fans are so kind, loved the trading of friendship bracelets. I waited over a year for this concert and it was well worth it. Can’t believe it’s over."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Our family were lucky to get tickets to see Gracie and Taylor in Toronto. What an experience. Core memories made for all of us. Thank you to Taylor, her crew, Gracie, and all of the staff at the Rogers Centre for making this such a memorable night"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"1000% worth the money. This was by far the best concert I have ever been to and went above and beyond my expectations. Every single part of this concert was perfect. Smooth entry into the venue, very helpful staff at the gates and helping seat people. The seats were great. And the concert itself was amazing. Definitely the best night of my life by far."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I went to Toronto N5, and long story short: It was the best night of my life. After years of listening to her music, this was my first time ever seeing Taylor live and I was not disappointed one bit (there was a 0% chance of an ounce of disappointment being in my body anyway). Toronto was totally in the Swiftie spirit and I loved it! It  made me even more excited to get into the stadium. Gracie opened for Taylor and she did AMAZING! My life was changed when I heard the Free Now bridge live. I hope to see Gracie in concert again! When Taylor came on I was full on sobbing. Who wouldn’t be? (Everyone around me…lol). I got to hear some of my childhood favourite songs live like Shake It Off and I Knew You Were Trouble, it was great! Taylor did such an amazing job performing and so did her dancers. I don’t even have words for just how much of an impressive performer she is. She performs for 3+ hours with insanely short breaks, it’s insane. Her stage is amazing, people aren’t lying when they say there isn’t a single bad seat at the Eras Tour. I was in section 527 and I saw EVERYTHING. I saw (and felt) the bad blood flames, the stage visuals, the flashing lights - everything. It was magical. I truly do hope to see Taylor in concert again the next time she decides to tour, I love her."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,TAYLOR SWIFT put on probably the best show I have ever seen in my life! I would be glad to see her again. What a professional entertainer and artist. Amazing song writer that has such a down to earth personality.  A true human being with epic talents!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Truly the BEST concert ever! If I could afford to pay another 3k in resale prices again I’d be going again. Loved every minute of it, so sad it’s over"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Amazing show! Taylor Swift is a class act! This was my 4th time seeing her and it was just as good as the first! Love her!!!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was a wonderful experience from start to finish.  No wait lines to get in to the Rogers Centre, most friendliest people everywhere, Taylor knows how to put on a great show, the girls danced and sang every word of her songs.  Only downfall was the merch line, we stood there for an hour and a half and came home with over sized shirts and hoodies as they didn’t have any small sizes left."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Insane show, 3 hours of amazing work. Taylor was phenomenal ofc but I really really appreciated the work of her dancers as well! Unforgettable experience🫶🏻🩶"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"True artistry, outstanding performance not only by Taylor but also her dancers. Impeccable timing on stage, high energy performance. One of the best nights of my life! Taylor Swift is an extraordinary performer whose talent is in a league of its own. Honoured to be apart of such an historical tour!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I have love Taylor Swift since I was a little kid, I was just 3 years old when her Debut album came out and I was hooked ever since I heard Tear Drops On My Guitar. I am 21 years old now and this was my first Taylor concert. I used to mourn that I never got to go to any of her concerts before but now I get to say I have been able to see every era that I thought I missed. I might sound dramatics but I don’t really care. This concert changed my life and I will remember it forever and ever!!!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Ticketmaster was easy to navigate with lots of communication about merchandise, ticket information, traffic, seating etc. 
Staff at the Roger’s Centre were friendly and eager to help. The queue to get in and merchandise moved quickly without issue. The concert itself was the trip of a lifetime and so worth the wait!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Absolutely incredible! I don’t think another concert will ever top the Eras Tour. The length, sets, vocals, and experience as a whole were one of a kind. My bf described it as a 3.5 hour Super Bowl worthy show because of how intense and amazing it was the whole time. Taylor is an extraordinary performer who truly thinks of every detail."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,A truly incredible concert. Taylor is an incredible artist. The memories we made at the Eras tour will last a lifetime. Seeing my daughter’s eyes light up as her dreams came true was one of the best moments of my life.
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"No bad seats at the Eras Tour. What a performance, honestly felt so safe in the environment surrounded by Swifties. Her voice and theatrics was mind blowing, I couldn’t look away."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The most amazing experience ever. So incredibly grateful that I got to attend this concert. Taylor Swift is a wonderful performer and I wish I could attend this show every night.
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I am extremely fortunate to say this was my third (and final) time seeing the Eras Tour. 

It is magical from the time you arrive at the town it’s being held at to the time the concert is over and everyone is walking out. 

Taylor Swift, the dancers, the band and even the towns she plays in all create the most magical experience for everyone. Whether you’re a life long fan or just joining, whether you’re in the 500s or on the floor, you’ll have the absolute time of your life. 

Thank you all!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was an asolutely breathtaking and amazing performance. Taylor killed it, her dancers killed it, her backup singers killed it, her band killed it, and the sound/tech crew killed it. Everyone involved killed it. I cried. Such a fun show and a fun environment. Everyone I traded bracelets with was lovely. The merch crew and concession sellers were so kind. The city itself did an excellent job (way to go Tayronto). Everything about this show blew me away and I loved it. Sucks that Ticketmaster handled the sale horribly, but luckily I was chosen. I hope all Canadian Swifties that didn't get to go to the Eras Tour get to go to her next tour."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Everything about this show was magical! From the moment we purchased tickets until the moment we left the Rogers Centre, everything went smoothly! It was stressful getting tickets in the first place because it was like winning the lottery to even get a pre-sale code but, once we had the tickets, we patiently waited over a year until it was time and WOW was it ever worth it! I would have waited a lifetime if I knew I’d get to see a show of that calibre. The whole production was seamless and, if there were any technical difficulties, we certainly couldn’t tell. Taylor Swift and her whole crew are total rockstars and work so professionally - we wouldn’t have been able to tell of anything went “wrong” because they perform with such strength and confidence, making everything look effortless! Every aspect of the show was captivating — her vocal performance and stage presence, their choreography, the stage set up and effects, the lighting/light show — even getting in and out of the Rogers Centre was a breeze! We were blown away by the bracelets given to every attendee that were somehow programmed to turn on a different points, in different rhythms and with various colours. The food and drinks available to purchase were a bit overpriced but delicious, and the price is to be expected at a stadium. The merchandise was cleverly set up in various sections of the building and, although lots of items were sold out, it was arranged in a way that ensured fans could at least see if there was anything they’d like to stand in line to get a chance to purchase. We had the time of our lives at this concert and don’t think anything will ever top it!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor put on an absolutely amazing performance. Every aspect of the show was incredible! Wish I could experience this all over again! Best experience of my life!!!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor was out of this world! What a superstar and what a performance!  Gracie rocked it! The Roger’s Centre was awesome and made it so easy to navigate and get in.  Experience of a lifetime ❤️
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Attended the Friday 5th Eras show in Toronto at Rogers Centre. The show was amazing, Taylor was amazing as always (I’ve seen her 3x now). It was everything I was expecting and more. 
My only regret to say is I was sad about the merch lines. 2hr wait at 5pm and the show started at 6:45. Sadly I did not get anything."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Top five days of my life this was the best concert I’ve ever been to the spectacular technology, the energy of the performers, the friendliness of the crowd just made for the perfect night"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The stress of getting codes, the 470 day wait from tickets purchased to show, flights, accommodation…seeing The Eras Tour was everything I could have imagined and more. What a show! What a performance!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,We tremendously enjoyed the concert. Worth every dollar I spent. My daughter’s 1st concert was very memorable as she adores Taylor Swift.
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The best and most thought out concert i have ever been to. Truly a magical experience and i am so blessed to have been able to attend. Thank you Taylor!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Great experience. Very well organized.  City did a great job guiding fans in the stadium and outside the arena to public transit. Felt safe.  Only complaint was the line up for the bathrooms
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This show was genuinely life-changing. It is incredible how she can perform, sing, and dance for 3+ hours -- i got tired just standing there! Her energy, the crowd, the songs, I could not have asked for a better show. The best night ever."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Toronto night 5 Simply outstanding performance.  I have watched the movie many times, but being there in Rogers Center with Taylor and the production staff was something I will never forget. Out of all 75 concerts I have been to. This one is was the Best.  So glad my daughter suggested us to go.  Thank you Taylor for that amazing Experience"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I attended Taylor Swift The Eras Tour night 5 in Toronto. It was absolutely amazing. Hands down the best concert I have ever had the opportunity to attend. Loved every minute of it. Being surrounded by so much positivity and kindness was unbelievable. Taylor Swift embodies that!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Nothing short of an amazing performance! Crowd “sparkled” with excitement, enthusiasm and happiness!💕
Taylor played non stop for over three hours! Everyone left with a heart filled with joy! Thanks for the once in a lifetime experience with a kind and thoughtful artist! The one and only Taylor “Sweetheart” Swift!💕💕💕"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift put on the performance of a lifetime. She was absolutely incredible.

I couldn’t stop smiling the entire time."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Perfection from start to finish. Never have I ever been in a more kind, welcoming and warm space. And goodness knows, we need that right about now."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Great experience - start to finish ordering tickets to claim to enter the Rogers Arena. The city was ready for the Eras tour and it was a fun environment—a great venue to see a concert. TAYRONTO was fantastic!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was an excellent production from start to finish. Easy to access tickets, entering and leaving the venue. Taylor put on a fantastic show. Well worth it, we are glad we didn’t sell our tickets. 😀
A concert to remember for sure."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor Swift puts on an amazing concert. She doesnt stop and her costume changes are so quick. Her back up dancers are very talented dancers. I was in awe. This 3.5 hour concert went by so fast and when it was over i was actually sad and immediately wanted to watch it again. I can completely understand why these girls and young women are becoming SWIFTIES.  I am 55 and a new SWIFTIE! THANK YOU TAYLOR SWIFT 💓
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Not only am I the best Mom in the world for securing tickets, but I am now apart of the sisterhood of Swifties. Taylor is probably the greatest show-woman I have ever seen in concert. This was my daughters first concert and she still hasn't come down from the high of the night. GREATEST NIGHT EVER!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was a night to remember. I’m so lucky to have been able to attend. Many fans wanted to attend and couldn’t. 
From the sets to Taylor’s showmanship it was as good as it gets. 
I hope it’s not too long before she tours again."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Great performance by Taylor! Magical production experience, overall a once in lifetime experience!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Not kidding when I say it was the best night of my life. The community, the friendship bracelet trading, the pure unadulterated joy. She’s created something so precious and so magical."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The best concert I’ve ever had. It feels like dream come true. Still not believe I just met Taylor for real. ILOVEUTAY!!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Best memories made with my daughter! The seats were amazing, couldn’t have asked for a better night."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This experience was everything that we needed after going through the pandemic and I always wanted to see her in concert and now I have for the first time I will always remember this moment for the rest of my whole life🥹🥲 my fave moment was singing my favourite songs from different eras such as red and folklore and the new album too was so amazing and I enjoyed the ending to the show too 🩷 i am gonna be honest waiting for a year for her to come to Toronto was the best wait ever and it was so worth it 🫶🏻❤️✨
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a fantastic show! So happy we were finally able to score face value tickets and go to the show. She performed for 3.5 hrs and was spectacular! I wish more people had the chance to get tickets to go.
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I had sky high expectations for this concert and it crushed them. Taylor Swift is absolutely incredible. It was not a cheap night but worth every penny and the memories I made with my wife and daughters. We all had a marvelous time…
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,She is amazing and genuinely the best performer I have ever seen. I can’t believe this tour is almost over 😭😭
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What a show. Taylor brought it as always, amazing show and energy for 3.5 hours. Gracie Abrams was so good as well, a surprise. She was a delight. The crowd was absolutely incredible. So much energy, everyone was so nice and everyone was engaged and locked in on every song. The standing ovation was the loudest and longest I’ve ever heard. I think even Taylor was taken back. Toronto was a great experience and N5 was one of the best shows I’ve ever been to….this dad was a hero to an amazing 11 yo daughter o this night and she had the time of her life. Thank you Taylor (and Gracie) and thank you Toronto!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This concert was the best thing that ever happened, Taylor but on such a great show!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Eras Tour was absolutely incredible! Every aspect of it was the most magical experience! From showing up to the giant friendship bracelet on the building, exchanging friendship bracelets, and getting themed snacks to the performance. The show - there are no words! You can tell the work that everyone involved put in to make it the most amazing show ever! The light-up bracelets  and shouting lyrics brought the whole stadium together where it felt like 49,000 people were just one giant community. Large events in a city also have the potential for safety concerns but I felt 100% safe the whole time."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The Eras tour was so amazing and so so great! The whole atmosphere was electric and including the light up bracelets really was a fun touch and seeing them all light up in sync was incredible! Great show and I hope Vancouver enjoys the final 3 shows they won’t be disappointed!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I can’t believe I finally got to the Eras Tour. It exceeded my very high expectations. We do not deserve Taylor and her music.
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"An incredible experience! Was very impressed by the preparedness of the city for this event, Roger’s was super organized and everyone was so friendly! Was incredible to be able to attend! Taylor, as always was amazing! Especially loved the themed drinks with friendship bracelets and specially named food items that Roger’s offered, so much fun ☺️"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Taylor Swift concert November 21/24 was the best concert of my life. Tremendously talented Taylor Swift put on an Amazing show. It was the experience of a lifetime.  My 13 year old daughter was overjoyed with the concert as well.
Thank you to everyone involved with this event."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Incredible! Worth the wait since I bought tickets Aug 2023! Sad to see the Eras your end (:
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was an Epic event of the lifetime. Great organization of the event. Seamless coordination. Kudos to all.
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The show itself was AMAZING, no complaints regarding the performance Taylor put on. However, my friends and I bought the Karma is Boyfriend package and disappointed for the price is an understatement. As we travelled to the show from another province we felt the that the originally promised perks of crowdless merch lines and early entry into the stadium was worth it to ensure we got the merchandise we wanted.  However, come show day we did not receive any of the perks for vip tickets that were promised to be apart of the package at the time we purchased the tickets, nor were we informed of this change to the package OR refunded for removing these perks. We found out through research that these perks were actually no longer part of the package a week before our show. With the chaos of Toronto and early merch days we attempted to try and get merch early to guarantee we got what we wanted, however, this was not the case despite lining up early. We attempted the merch line 3 different days and still did not get the correct sizes we wanted as they had sold out within minutes. Part of this problem was the fact that there was no limit on how many items people could buy, so we saw multiple people walk out with multiples of the highly coveted blue crew necks and grey quarter zips. Another issue we encountered was the lack of organization when it came to entry into the stadium. We asked multiple workers where we should be standing in line and they had no clue and pointed us in a general direction. With this disorganized entry into the stadium, we ended up standing the wrong line for approximately an hour. As for the vip box that was supposed to be shipped to our house before the show did not arrive until after our show date I cannot speak to the quality of the merch in those boxes but can say that with the removed perks on show day in general the VIP karma is my boyfriend package was a waste of money and not worth it. Just another way to take advantage of and up charge swifties who want to see to see their favourite artist in person."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,it was great i cried she sounded so good im sad it’s ending and im sad i wont be there for the rest of it I LOVE U TAYLOR
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"There is no better show than Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. Over 3 hours of pure entertainment fueled by Taylor’s unparalleled talent that made me feel every possible emotion in a giant arena full of (mostly) women and girls that somehow felt like a giant collective hug. I don’t know that I’ll ever feel as safe, as carefree, or as hopeful as I felt in that space for that short but brilliant moment in time. I’m so glad and thankful to have had the opportunity and privilege to experience this epic masterpiece."
