7/2/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,One of the highlights of my life. I have been a fan of Coldplay since Mylo Xyloto and this just brought tears to my eyes. Simply beautiful.
8/5/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Genuinely the best concert I’ve ever attended. I went with my dad who’s a big coldplay fan, my mom who solely listens to music in our language, and me who’s a casual listener with lots of nostalgia. All 3 of us really loved the concert. The atmosphere was amazing and I’ve never seen performers look like their having as much fun as Coldplay. Their interactions with the audience were great and their talent unparalleled. The beautiful lights and the fact that they try to make their concerts as green as possible is icing on top of the cake. If someone can only go to one concert I would really recommend Coldplay, they know how to put on a show and give you an amazing time."
7/6/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"It was a unique experience; I wish I had gotten floor tickets so I could try out the cool bikes and trampoline; that looked fun.  I have seen Coldplay before and enjoyed the feeling so much that I wanted to see them again.  They didn't disappoint.  It's hard to describe, but I just feel weightless at their shows.  Like I feel happy, lighter in heart.  People look at me funny for loving their shows so much, but it's just so hard to convey the value in the way they make me feel.  

H.E.R. was as amazing as I thought she'd be.  I knew of the guitar skills, but she does drums too!  And she can play drums WHILE singing??  Talent.  Her whole team = talent.  I would definitely see H.E.R. again.  It was a mix of rock and R&B, like...RR&B!  I loved the energy and the music.  Excellent choice of partnership."
7/6/22,FedExField - Landover,"This was my second time to see Coldplay, and once again, it was a thrill! From the moment the guys came on stage, the music was awesome, as were the lights and fireworks. I have been a Coldplay fan for many years, and seeing them live has created some of my very best memories. It's amazing how good music can make you feel. I also love the fact that Coldplay does so many positive things with their fame and money, which is not something you see that often from celebrities. There were images and information projected prior to the concert to show some of their worldwide projects. As far as the musical selection, there was a great mix from all of the albums, from Parachutes to Music of the Spheres. My daughter's boyfriend, who is actually a country fan, was impressed and even commented that ""Chris Martin has the voice of an angel."" (Well, I already knew that, but still...) It was a really fun night, and I can't wait to see my British Boys again!"
10/6/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This was the best experience of my life. Definetely the highlight of my summer. I loved the set up, the music, and the energy of the crowd."
9/7/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,I’m tears from the moment the fireworks went off to the very end. An amazing experience I’ll never forget. I wish I could live this concert again ❤️
6/10/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"I bought a ticket to see Coldplay by myself for their show in Chicago on the 28th of May. I had such a GREAT time that I decided to purchase a ticket for their show on the 29th. I’m glad that I did, this experience was so surreal. Definitely one of the best concerts that I’ve EVER been to"
7/11/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"WOW there are no words! We have been to many concerts and this just blew us away! From the minute they came on stage to the end, it was just an immersive experience of all senses. There wasn't a person in the place not jumping around, singing and dancing. It was out of this world, we loved every minute. Plus they are really good guys, brining a nice message, rare these days. If you get chance, go, you won't regret it!"
7/12/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"I loved seeing Coldplay at Soldier Field. It was my first stadium concert and my first time seeing Coldplay. I loved every second of it. I did NOT sit down. I danced the entire concert, with the exception of going to the bathroom and beer runs. I HIGHLY recommend going to see Coldplay!! They put on a great show. If Coldplay comes to your town GO SEE THEM!!!"
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It was so engaging that I felt like it was more of a personal experience than a crowd of almost 70,000! Loved the way it brought us closer to everyone around us and made us want to be better people."
10/3/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The tickets for this event were expensive. However, Coldplay is phenomenal. HER was amazing and being on the floor really excited me."
11/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay always exceeds expectations and this concert in Pasadena, CA did just that once again.  You're the best, Coldplay!"
11/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Music of the Spheres 2023 at Lumen field / Seattle, WA. was  AMAZING  AS ALWAYS! I've been to 5 Coldplay concerts now and they just get better. 
I see alot of concerts of diffrent bands and honestly Coldplay puts on the BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN! WONT MISS A 
COLDPLAY CONCERT!! THANK YOU COLDPLAY FOR ALL YOU DO!!!!!!!!!!"
10/5/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,memorable experience coldplay rock ou of the stadium and full of joy fireworks and production was amazing not to mention the quality of sound. The only thing that I submit is they had only one ticket office available so I had to walk too far to reach the southwest ticket office available to claim my tickets. everything else was amazing !
10/6/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Overall the show was amazing, great effects, lights, the showmanship and dynamic between Chris and the public was energic. Just great!"
10/6/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Not a fan of coldplay but I can say is worth your money and time going to see them love. The show is full of energy and the light show is amazing
10/7/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"It was a wonderful experience♥️ colorful, a very good vibe, positive and a great message to take care of our planet, and if we want to be loved, we have to be love! 
I am ready for their next tour!"
10/17/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This was probably the best concert I’ve ever been to. The energy in the stadium was unlike any other gathering and I heard all of my favorite songs. There were light up bracelets that we took on our way in and I felt like I was a part of every song when it lit up multicolors! I love how they moved their stage closer to the back at the end so everyone felt like they had an equal opportunity to see Coldplay up close. So many environmentally friendly practices were in place and the confetti was a nice memorabilia I got to take home with me. Truly fantastic, definitely a must-see show everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime."
10/29/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The show was awesome.  Lot of energy and effects.  Venue was uncomfortable though.  Bench seating is tight and there are no backs so my back was sore after.
10/30/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"First concert we’ve attended as a family and had a great time. My husband and I came with our daughters (18 & 24 years old). What struck me was that the audience around us was so culturally diverse yet we all came together to enjoy singing along to the same music. 

Cold Play put in a fabulous show as usual. H.E.R. Is amazingly talented. I was not impressed with the first opening act at all. 

Also I would suggest more merch tables throughout. We were on the third level and had a long walk to get to it. 

The venue was great, we had no issues getting to our seats or leaving the stadium which surprised me as there were 70k fans. 

Overall it was one of the more memorable concerts I’ve been to and would highly recommend a Cold Play concert. I loved the production, light bands, fireworks and just the upbeat diverse community vibe.

I would suggest letting the audience know that the bins for the light bands are at the stadium doors. Many were being tossed into the regular blue recycling bins."
11/14/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Amazing-Amazing-Amazing!  Coldplay put on a fun filled and interactive concert.  From peddling the bikes, jumping on the trampoline to create energy for the following concert, wearing the wristbands that were handed out and lit up as songs played, to the giant balls and balloons that took over and filled the floor was nothing short of amazing.  Many if not all were dancing and singing along to the lyrics.  Definitely a must see concert for all!"
11/22/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"So, so good!  Amazing!  Please come to south-eastern United States.  Or south central US.  Can't wait to see you  guys again.  Stay healthy and strong. Love you guys."
4/20/24,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Giving an ode to one of their songs in the review title, the concert was just that... AN ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME. It's the second time I see them live, which does not do justice to the time that I've been a Coldplay fan; but they would never host a concert in Puerto Rico, therefore, I had to travel to finally see them! But it was so worth it!!

This second time around, I had the privilege to see them up close and personal in the Floor Section of the stadium. It was the fight of my life to reach barrier in the B-stage, but it was SO worth it. I've never been so happy and excited as I was in this concert!! The view is definitely different than the seated view. The audience becomes one with the band in these concerts. The sense of community I felt when I was at the concert is like no other. I love this fandom with all my heart and this won't be the last that I see of Coldplay live!! The scenography, the thought process that they take to deliver an amazing show is worth every penny... And on top of that, the sustainable practices that they take into account with every purchased ticket and the methods to power their show is very thoughtful!!"
6/14/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was great, but traffic getting to the venue was a DISASTER. There were no traffic police and  I guess the parking attendants decided to start letting everyone in at the last minute because whatever they were doing wasn’t helping the flow of traffic. Basically, I stayed 5 minutes from the venue and it took me 45 minutes to get to fedex field because of stand still traffic. So I missed 45 minutes of the show. The LED bracelets were great but I wish they would’ve worked for every song."
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The Coldplay concert was a beautiful experience. Their set list blended a great mix of songs from their catalog and latest album. The production value was top notch. It really did feel like we were all part of the band singing along throughout the show. Coldplay is one of the best bands to experience live, if not the best, because their songs are made for big arenas. Will definitely plan to see them again in the future!"
6/17/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay was amazing. They can throw a show and have you smiling all night. Fireworks, interactive bracelets and a good time!"
6/19/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Title says it all. Coldplay was amazing, the way they included all attendees in the show using light-up wristbands was creative and beautiful to see in action. But the aftermath was a nightmare and the reason that was the last time I go to a show at MetLife. Friend who was supposed to pick us up couldn't get through bc of road closures by traffic cops, PABT-bound bus line had easily over 1000 people waiting on it, Lyft app was not connecting to drivers bc of the high demand. Ended up walking to the mall across the overpass and, after failing to get a Lyft driver to pick us up there either, met the friend who had originally tried to pick us up, over 1.5 hours after the show ended. Unless you have an easy way out (your own car), the stress is not worth it."
6/19/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"Exciting show and entertaining, but it was very obvious those in charge of sound had not gotten out from behind their headphones, because the speaker sound was incredibly bad. I've been to other shows where speakers end up bursting, and this sounded very close to that. Really was a MAJOR distraction to the show."
6/20/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,One of the best shows I’ve ever seen and this is my 3rd time seeing them. The whole robot head and puppet duets were not my thing but terrific show all around!
6/20/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay never lets you down!! Whether you are on the floor or in the nose bleeders, they seem to manage reaching everyone with a great live show!! The light up wrist bands are one of my fave parts!!!"
6/21/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was one of the best concerts i think I've ever seen! It was very interactive with the light bracelets and very creative playing along with the music and theme. The fireworks, lights, beach balls, lasers were all a great touch to keep the concert engaging!!!! Overall, such a great show! Can't wait to see their next tour!!!!"
6/22/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The Coldplay concert at Lincoln Financial Field was amazing!  I hadn't been to a concert in many years until that night, and I was blown away! The wristband lights made the stadium glow so beautifully. But most importantly, the music was awesome!  I would see Coldplay again in a heartbeat! The only downside to the night was the horrendous TRAFFIC getting to LFF (we sat in one spot for almost 30 minutes, right near our parking spot) and then again when leaving the parking lot after the concert. Other than the traffic/parking, it was a wonderful night!!!"
6/22/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"What can I say, simply amazing!! I first saw Coldplay in 2016 when they came to Indianapolis.  I had such an amazing time, I knew I just had to see them the next chance I got.  Went to see them this year in Chicago at Soldier Field, which by the way was awesome b/c it was open and you had a view of the skyline plus fireworks.   Both tours they give you wristbands that light up to the beats of the songs.  They had kinetic bikes and dance pads so the crowd could use and it that helped provide energy for their shows. They are such awesome performers, great songs, and overall a great group of guys.  If you get the chance, go see them, I promise you won't regret it!"
6/23/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"It was almost a religious experience. Coldplay put on an amazing show that made everybody leave in a happy mood (and this despite some crazy heavy rain on the way out). The lights, fireworks, sound, connection between fans and band- everything was unlike anything i've ever seeb. By the way, i did not previously consider myself a huge colday fan, but i recommend anybody interested to go to their concert. Plus, it was reasonably priced! You won't regret it."
6/23/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The best Concert. Music and lights are amazingly, My family and I were very excited enjoying the coldplay concert.  I congratulate you for the logistics and organization of the event."
6/24/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This was my first concert and it was seriously one of the best experiences of my life I love this band so much and even in nosebleed seats it was amazing the venue was amazing the bathrooms were clean and it was easy to find what you need the only bad thing I would have to say is it was hard to find parking but that’s it!!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
6/27/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,That was the best concert ever!!! It was so much fun and interactive and all the lights and you just wanted to dance and sing the whole time and so many different people all singing and laughing together. It was just so amazing and I can't wait to see them again!!!!
6/28/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"One of the most fun concerts I've ever been to! Coldplay puts on quite a show! Great set selection. Always energizing music. The band really seems to have fun - and we all do too. Fun with the wristbands that changed colors, and the balloons, and the paper stars falling. Kept the stadium rocking!"
6/28/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I WANT TO GO AGAIN!! If I were to express how much I loved this concert then this would be so long but It was absolutely amazing to be short, the best concert I have been to thus far. if you love Coldplay or even if you aren't familiar with them, you will love this. The energy in the stadium was unmatchable. You just knew there were people there who have been fans for decades and people who were new and caught on and loved it. H.E.R. was absolutely fantastic and so talented."
6/29/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay puts on an EXCELLENT show. We had so much fun, and it was worth every penny. I would definitely go see them again!"
7/13/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Great show! Loved the wrist bands lighting the audience up. None stop action. Sounded great live. Very entertaining ☺️
7/17/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was truly amazing. Great music, fireworks and lights. The only thing negative  was that it was a little too loud. It almost sounded like it was blowing the speakers at times. I honestly think it would have sounded even better if it were down a few decibels. I’m surprised Chris Martin wouldn't be more sensitive to the volume."
7/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Absolutely Fantastic, from start to finish concert was so uplifting, full of energy, talent, atmosphere and Great time by ALl"
8/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,My favorite band always bless us with the best show! This was my second show of MOTS and I’ll be seeing them again. There’s no other band in the world like Coldplay!!
9/27/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The most colourful show I've ever been to.  I enjoyed the performance of HER, she has a beautiful voice. Everything from beginning to end was worth it"
9/27/23,BC Place - Vancouver,The show itself was top notch. Coldplay absolutely rocked it from start to finish. The BC Place concession was absalute garbage. Molsen Canadian cans (which had to be poured into pop cups afterwards) and Granville Island Beers are the worst selection you can ever have. Whitecaps games actually have great beer at the thirsty pigeon bars on tap. It was sad you had no options. Next time I’ll be sneaking in my own liquor.
9/27/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"I knew very little about Coldplay and only knew a few songs I’d heard my ex play periodically.
Her and I bought tickets along time ago, and had since decided to just be friends. The day of the show she offered the tickets to me because she couldn’t find someone to go with her. I asked my new girlfriend and she said let’s go!
So we went, and I was amazed at the whole production.
Their songs were emotional to say the least. After it was over, we kinda hung around, not wanting to leave. 

I’ve been to so many concerts I’ve probably forgotten half of them, but I’ll never forget Coldplay.
Thanks you guys for a job well done."
9/27/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The show was amazing, the sound was amazing wish the merch truck showed up cause majority of the items were sold out before the first opening act"
9/29/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay is a concert every human should experience! They are incredible and beyond talented. Their energy is electric and out of this world. I attend many many concerts and Coldplay is hands down the BEST concert ever! You can tell they love what they do and love their fans. I cannot wait to see them again one day!! Worth every penny!!
9/30/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"My Coldplay concert experience was amazing!  What a show - so uplifting and fun!  Everyone I encountered working at the venue was friendly and helpful.  The only drawback were the people in the standing room (Toyota Fan Deck?) area near my seat (Section 320 Aisle I Seat 20) who were laughing and talking loudly during the last part of the concert.  Loud enough that it was difficult to hear Chris sing from C-Stage.  This was my first Coldplay concert, and though it feels dramatic to say so, it was transformative.  My thoughts keep going back to how it felt to be there, and the feelings and ideas that have stayed with me.  Thank you, Coldplay and Lumen employees, for gifting me with such a meaningful experience."
