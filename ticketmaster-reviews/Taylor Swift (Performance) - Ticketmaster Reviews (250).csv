1/13/25,BC Place - Vancouver,"Words are truly not enough to fully encapsulate the energy, excitement and impressiveness that was The Eras Tour. Having seen the show on 3 separate occasions (Seattle and Vancouver x2), I never grew tired of walking through those stadium gates; the eager concert goers trading friendship bracelets with everyone they saw, the sparkling outfits that you know took months and months of preparation, the Swift-themed menu items, the spontaneous singalongs...and this was all before Taylor took the stage. The show itself felt more like a fever dream than a concert. The talent, coordination, composure and athleticism required to put on such a production is something that will be studied in high regard for years to come. The set flowed immaculately and went by in a blink, despite it being 3h long. Between the inside jokes, traditions old and new and overall classic Taylor Swift dazzling energy, this was a tour made for the fans, and it did not disappoint. Truly one of the best shows I have ever had the privilege of seeing. I will remember this tour all too well in the most enchanting way. Long Live the Eras Tour <3"
12/18/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"absolutely incredible. the atmosphere & energy in the venue  was unlike anything I have ever felt before. being surrounded by fans who were happy and wanted to celebrate the final show. it was a true form of girlhood. I have never felt safer in a room of 60,000 people. Taylor and everyone involved in this show made everything so magical."
12/17/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The show was everything one could hope it would be. Entry into and security for BC Place was smooth and professional, had no problems getting drink, food, merch, and leaving afterwards. The systems put into place to move folks through every aspect were clearly well considered. Taylor and her crew were just incredible. Words cannot describe how immensely amazing the entire evening was."
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Untouchable is what The Eras Tour is and was! I had the time of my life fighting dragons with everyone that was there in person, and via the grainy livestreams. While I will always always wish that many a bot didn’t get their hands on tickets to resell via third party sites, I can’t help but appreciate that Taylor and her team also offered “no view” seats for the final weekend. That said, our seats still had an incredible view with the added bonus of seeing the entire tour crew in a behind the scenes style way. We sang, shook it off, cried, cheered (1-2-3 LGB), and left glitter on the floor after the party."
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,One of the best concerts I've been to this year!! Taylor will always be amazing at what she does!
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Half of the main stage and 1/3 of the screen was BLOCKED by a light tower and lights. Yet we had NO idea of this when choosing to spend an EXTREME amount of money that we thought would give us a good clear view.
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Just incredible vibe! Taylor and anll her crew are amazing! They put an unforgettable show!
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift is magnificent. She is so beautiful and talented. She has awesome energy and she is a total entertainer. I love her.
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best tour experience even though seats were at the back the experience was the best. Taylor, Gracie and her team gave their all for the tour."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I waited so long to get tickets to The Eras Tour and let me tell you, I’m glad it happened the way it did! Taylor is an AMAZING performer. Such a great show! Cried, laughed, danced, and made memories to last forever! I will never forget this experience. Looking forward to another Taylor Swift show in the future! 10/10!"
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It's Taylor Swift. It's the Eras Tour. So of course the show itself was incredible!!! I also saw her at Levi Stadium last summer and loved it then, too.
The reason for only 4 out of 5 stars: Unfortunately for the Vancouver show, I was in section 455, and there was a light structure on the floor with pyrotechnics on top that totally blocked center stage and the center of the big screen. The only other screens were relatively small and at the top of BC Place. Because of this, me and those around me missed out on a lot. Having traveled from CA and having paid a lot for my ticket, this was pretty disappointing."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is, without a doubt, one of the most extraordinary and iconic live performances of our time. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that blends musical history, emotional storytelling, and unparalleled stagecraft into an unforgettable night. In terms of sheer spectacle and artistry, The Eras Tour is a benchmark in concert history. It’s the kind of event that leaves you thinking, “I was there.” Witnessing Taylor Swift in her prime, commanding the stage with grace, passion, and charm, is an experience that will stay with you forever. Whether you're a die-hard Swiftie or a newcomer, it’s impossible to leave the show without feeling like you've just witnessed one of the most incredible performances ever to grace the stage. Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is not just a concert—it’s an event. An event that celebrates the power of music, the joy of shared experiences, and the artistry of one of the most talented musicians of our time."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Our seats were a lot better than originally expected. Everyone around us were so happy to be there, as were we! It was an incredible experience to listen/ watch all Taylor’s hits with that many fans coming together. There was a shared spirit of kindness and generosity and fun unlike any other concert I have been to. A core memory for sure :)"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,i’ve been wanting to see taylor forever. and this dream finally came true. the seats weren’t fully behind the stage so that was good and we saw taylor a few times. BEST THINF EVER
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Every moment of December 8th is a moment I will remember. Thank you Taylor, thank you Mum, thank you to every person I met who traded bracelets and shared conversations with me. Thank you."
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Every single person I talked to was kind and friendly, and everyone was open to meeting new people and trading bracelets. I loved the music and choreography of the show. 5/5 would go again"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great concert, amazing show, one of the best. Had a wonderful time, glad Vancouver was the last show!"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best concert I have ever attended! Taylor Swift went above and beyond for her fans, playing 3 1/2 hours.  Going to a TS show is probably the most positive experience a person could have.  Everyone is happy, no judgment, people singing along, smiling and having the best times of their life.  I am grateful I attended and will never forget this experience with my daughter and my friends.  She is truly an Icon.  Thank you Taylor for the ERAS tour.  Your fans will never forget it!"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor’s Eras Tour was a cinematic experience. The choreography, lights, songs were all carefully thought out. I only got tickets to one show and I’m grateful to have had that opportunity! The only down side for me was the man in front of me. He was too tall for my own good. At one point he had shifted down his row blocking my view of the entire stage during The Tortured Poets Department set. I didn’t say anything because his wife was having the time of her life and I didn’t want to take the chance of souring their experience. Next time, I think I’ll try and go for front row of whatever section I can get."
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The best concert I’ve been to hands down! Taylor put on such an amazing performance!
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Unbelievable show!  Taylor gives it her all for 3 1/2 hrs. Gracie was also amazing and so talented. Love that we got to see them sing together at the end of the show. Two beautiful confident talented women. Such a great example for young women everywhere.
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,A show unlike any other. Swift is unmatched in the experience she provides fans. Air will be interesting so see where she goes from here
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"My daughter and I came from L
Prince George for the last show of her tour and we experienced a seminal moment in both our lives. Everyone that we ran into from fans to staffers, security and venders we so unbelievably warm and friendly!  I was so happy, myself, that I got to dance (and hard) to some of my favourites: ‘Cruel Summer’, ‘Lover’, ‘Delicate’, ‘Are You Ready for It’ and ‘Don’t Blame Me’  and then ‘Willow’ and ‘Betty’ later on. I love Taylor Swift so I wasn’t too surprised how much I was going to enjoy her.  The real ‘magic’, for me was getting to experience the raw, unbridled emotion that poured out from my daughter when Taylor played her ‘surprise’ songs, starting with ‘New Romantics’. Seeing my daughter, Jorja, exasperated trying to catch her breath as she realized what Taylor was playing and seeing the tears stream down her face, without remission, made me lose all control and I cried inconsolably.  The bonds that were forged between dad and daughter over the entire weekend were made possible because of the flawless show that we were able to attend.  Well done Ticketmaster as well for making it so easy to redeem our on -line tickets. 
Can’t wait to do another Ticketmaster event , hopefully sooner than later; 
Sincerely Ryan McMaster, Prince George, BC"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The Eras Tour was AMAZING! A 3 1/2 hour show with only max 3 minutes in between eras. I don’t think any concert will top that for me!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved the concert! But getting tickets is what was very hectic. Also the prices were very extreme even for other artists not to mention when others were re selling them. Need a better solution and system. The concert though was an amazing experience and feel so lucky I got to experience it. I hope I’m just as lucky to go the next time
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,By far the best concert I have ever witnesses. Taylor Swift knows how to rock the stage.  Plus BC Stadium in Vancouver was an outstanding venue.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"One of the best performances I’ve ever seen. The singing, the dancers, the band, the production, it all was amazing."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was awesome and everything I thought it would be. Taylor Swift put on a great show.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We attended the last Taylor Swift Concert in Vancouver. It was a ""great show""but, it felt more like a stage-show on Broadway - very scripted. Taylor Swift appeared like she was going through the motions, and there was no personal engagement with the crowd. Her comments were the same across the three nights in Vancouver. No comment about it being her last show, rather a general comment about the end of Eras Tour. It felt like the ""elephant in the room""within the stadium - the last show of the Eras Tour, but no acknowledgement of this. This seemed like a running commentary as we left the stadium.

The show lacked the spontaneity and involvement of other concerts. This was dissapointing. She appeared understandably done with the tour. But, perhaps it's lengthiness was too much. I would have been happy with less of a production and more of the great singer she is."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"All I can say is it was simply the best 🫶🏻💕. Taylor, her band, dancers, everyone... The stadium, staff and security… all of it was done so well! An unforgettable night."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Most amazing concert performed by THE best artist of our generation, her wonderful band/back-up singers and absolute top-dancers. Performance of a lifetime!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Attended three Eras Tours and was beyond chuffed to be there for the “Farewell” Era 😢 My life is so much better off for these opportunities 🫶🏻 Money can be made, but there’ll only be on Eras Tour ❤️"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Night 3 in Vancouver. Final show, awesome vibes with an incredible atmosphere. TSwift is amazing live."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was amazing and did not matter where you sat!  The merchandise was okay but they fell very short on the blue crew necks
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Was such a great show and performance! Was so worth the whole experience I hope she comes again! I’d bring the whole family! Everyone who wasn’t a swiftie defiantly became one after the concert
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was a good concert. Great stage, performance. But was more entertained at a slipknot concert."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved this show taylor put on an amazing performance and had the crowd amazed
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The Eras Tour was my first concert. And it was literally magical. The high this concert gave will be hard to compare to now that I move on to shorter/shorter budget concerts. Taylor did a great job! Can’t wait to see what else she will do after she gets the very well deserved break she needs!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I cannot believe how amazing this concert and tour was. I brought my daughter and wife and we will never forget it!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Amazing concert. Fast lines going in and out of the stadium. Food and drinks not overpriced. Great execution!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We were so lucky to get tickets in one of the pre-concert drops to the final show on Dec 8.

Taylor was amazing and the crowd was absolutely electric."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Finding the words to encapsulate my eras tour experience seems impossible but I’m going to do my best because I feel like I have to say something. Like everyone else, I tried to get tickets for this tour at every opportunity. My friends and I were willing to go anywhere at any time as long as we could get tickets, but it didn’t work out over and over again. One last time I registered for verified fan when the Vancouver dates were released. Once again I got waitlisted, but while on a work trip to Toronto I got a text in the airport that I was cleared from the waitlist and suddenly the moment I was chasing for over a year was right in front of me. I surprised my best friend with these tickets for her birthday 3 weeks after I bought them with custom friendship bracelets with the show date and location. Fast forward 1 year and 29 days and there we are in Vancouver for the last ever eras tour show. Everything worked out exactly the way it was meant to and I feel that in my soul. I’ll never get over being about to be part of the cultural movement that was the eras tour, from talking my about every detail of the show with my friends, going to see the movie in theaters, trading friendship bracelets with girls at brunch before the show to spending hours and hours and hours bedazzling a body suit to wear to the show, to finally experiencing it live with my best friends. Thank you Taylor Swift, for existing in the same timeline as me and for bringing the magic and joy of girlhood to an all time high and giving us all the confidence and self worth to exist as our truest and most authentic selves. I laughed, I cried (a lot), and embraced the women in my life I love so much.  And I can confidently say, I have been changed for good."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Getting to see the ERAS Tour on the last night was the greatest experience of my life. I just can’t believe how lucky I am to have gotten tickets. I would 100/10 recommend seeing Taylor in concert! She’s amazing!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was magical! A great show, memories were made! I will think about this for the rest of my life."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Bittersweet but a Taylor never disappoints! Loved every second of it. The costumes, the choreography, the set list, our Surprise Songs, the fans, Vancouver!!!, the list continues…all these and many more absolutely slayed!!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I’ve been a big fan since I was in middle school which is 10+ years ago! I’ve been to every concert she’s had since speak now and I plan to for the rest of my life!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The energy was over the top! Taylor Swift has made an historic event with a show like never seen before!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"getting into the arena was a bit difficult. there were long snaky lines throughout many parts of downtown vancouver. while i understand a large amount of people have to get through a small opening at the same time, i felt this could’ve been handled better, especially since it was the third (and final) night. for instance, a guard was directing foot traffic through cones and caution tape, while stating that sometimes the other gate (gate h) opens up, but she had no idea when it would. when i was about to the front of gate b, gate h suddenly opened, causing a slew of concert goers to rush over and disrupt the coned off line. there were also no lights around this part of the stadium, causing a bit of a safety issue as there are many stairs. i felt the overall foot traffic could’ve been directed better, as this was the final night in the city with the same amount of crowd. i completely understand that many concert goers were uninformed, standing around, causing and incredible inconvenience for those actively fighting to get into a line, but a stronger presence of direction could’ve resolved this issue. for instance, an email explaining gate information, times, and closures would’ve been helpful for those who have never visited the city. clear ‘start’ signs to show where lines begin would’ve also been helpful since may were traveling from all street directions. an appropriate amount of gates open to better control the influx of foot traffic also would’ve been confident. overall, staff did a great job of trying to control the crowd, but a little more guidance would’ve been helpful. thank you to all who made this experience possible!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Thank you, Taylor, for sharing your talent with the world. This show was amazing. Just three hours of non-stop action performed with nothing but love and joy. I am honored and blessed to have been there, and for the rest of my life I will remember it all."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved every moment of the show!! It was so packed though I’m definitely going to stream it soon to reminisce on this experience.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was our second time going to the Eras
Tour. We were so happy to be there the final show. It was just as amazing as the first time we went. A well done show with fantastic energy and performances."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Eras Tour was the most amazing experience. Taylor and her crew put on a truly magnificent concert that left fans changed. It is hard to put into words how phenomenal it was. Truly, I hope I carry those memories with me in my entire life. I’m so glad I got to be a part of this historic and iconic event."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I had behind the stage seating with no obstructions. The screen was right there which was nice, but since there was one screen and it had been programmed to mostly show the backgrounds and supporting graphics for each of the eras, we often didn’t get to see what Taylor was doing. The Jumbotron screen facing us was blank, which I thought was too bad because it would’ve helped us be able to see more of her performance while still seeing the backgrounds."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Thank you Taylor for creating such a loving, fun, and amazing atmosphere. You allowed us to dance, sing, cry, and all share the most magical moments with you and somehow, in this crazy world, all 160,000 of us this weekend, were like family. You made something so huge seem so intimate. You made something beautiful and you changed the world with this tour."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Best experience of my life. I am grateful i was able to get the $16 no stage view tickets at first and i tried again to get “ better “ seats and i finally did! I Got floor tickets and that is what made my experience even better. Seats were amazing almost close to the stage! I am just glad i got to finally experience The Taylor Swift Eras Tour Concert as my first ever concert! Thank you Ticketmaster and most importantly Big Thanks to Taylor and her Whole Crew involved! MAYBE for next time lower the prices a tad more lower.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I think Taylor's concert has a very obvious flaw, especially if you see it more than once. The biggest issue is that it actually ends. I hope the singer takes this seriously and works on it. A concert that eventually comes to an end? Truly disappointing."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,City of Vancouver did a great job on being organized and ready for us. Too few merch sale locations and frequently sold out. Concert was AMAZING! BC Place was ready and organized. Was a fun weekend!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Cannot say enough about the show, it was a once in a lifetime experience!  That said, I know that we were some of the lucky ones able to get tickets locally.  The majority of the crowd was people who had travel to attend.  I wish there were more available for locals to buy and attend. So many people tried and tried to get tickets and were unsuccessful yet there were many we talked to who have seen multiple shows and had travelled to see the last ones here.  
The resale prices were ridiculously high which was also a disappointment. It priced so many out of buying tickets."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I went to the final show of the Eras tour and it was no less than magical! I’m still singing dancing and bringing that energy into every aspect of my life and the world! So glad I went to the Tampa show on April 14, 2023 and the last show in Vancouver December 8, 2024. I love good music!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was an amazing concert. The line ups were massive, not too many health options for food. The merch line ups were insane. Happy to see additional bathrooms available for the extra female attendants. But the bathroom line was still insane."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor’s concert was the most amazing concert I have ever attended, and I have seen many legends over the decades, or Eras of my life. Taylor began on time and never stopped entertaining us for 3 1/2 hours. Even when she was doing quick costume changes we were entertained with amazing dancers and beautiful graphics. The huge screen let everyone feel like we were much closer. It was such an energetic performance, and Taylor made us feel so special for turning out to see her, she loves performing and appreciates her fans. The enthusiasm of the crowd was so contagious, everyone was happy, friendly and kind. An amazing,  positive evening I’ll always remember. What a STAR!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,My daughter and I had the best time I knew it was gonna be a good show but never in 1 million years did I think it would be the best thing I’ve ever seen in an incredibly magical experience
3/3/25,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"NOLA N2 was literally the best night of my life. Taylor sounded absolutely amazing, and having Sabrina as a special guest made the show even more incredible! The Eras Tour was incredible!!!!!"
12/12/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Beautiful stage and costumes. Gracie Abrams was killer. Over 3 hours of Taylor including TPPD! Overwhelming!
11/25/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I have seen almost every Eras Tour livestream and this was still worth every penny.  Taylor and her team put on an amazing show that would entertain even the smallest fan.  The show was such an experience that the time flew by.  She knows how to please her fans.  Can't wait for the next tour.
11/22/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Attending Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour was nothing short of magical! From start to finish, the entire experience was perfectly orchestrated. Ticketmaster made the process seamless, and the anticipation leading up to the event only added to the excitement.

Taylor’s performance was absolutely phenomenal. Her stage presence, vocals, and the stunning visuals made every moment unforgettable. Each era came to life with its own unique charm, taking us on a nostalgic journey through her musical evolution. The energy in the crowd was electric, and you could feel the love and connection Taylor shares with her fans.

The venue was well-organized, with clear signage and helpful staff. Entry was smooth, and the sound quality was impeccable throughout the night. I especially appreciated how Ticketmaster kept us updated on event details leading up to the show, which made planning so much easier.

This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m so grateful to Ticketmaster for helping make it happen. Thank you for bringing us closer to an artist who means so much to so many. I’ll cherish this night forever!"
11/16/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was the most fun I’ve had at a concert, ever! Swifties are the kindest, most inclusive , body celebrating group I’ve ever been a part of. The experience is only topped by the amazing talent and theatrics of Taylor and her crew. I will forever be a fan and will do my best to never miss a show tour, even if it means traveling out of town."
11/13/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The show was spectacular! I don't know if any concert will ever beat this. I am still in shock that I was able to see the Eras tour in person.
11/12/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"An amazing experience! Eras lived up to the hype! Taylor was fantastic, on stage for +3 hours and was incredibly engaging. The Swifties were out in force, such a great community; the SuperDome was filled with love and support."
11/10/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Best show I’ve ever seen. Loved all the sets and dancers. Loved going through the eras. Light up bracelet was also really fun.
11/8/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor was a bucket list performer for my daughter and I. Girl got some pipes on her! Not once did she show signs of tiring as my daughter and I sang our hearts out! I've never felt nor experienced so much positive energy in one place in my life! Words could NEVER describe Taylor other than it was a magical experience that you HAVE to be there for! We were there, it was rare, I will remember it for the rest of my life! ❤️ Be prepared for withdraws! Lol"
11/7/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,As a mom my heart will cherish this night for the rest of my life.   It was pure love.   The excitement and joy resonating from every person in that arena added to the insane brilliance of the show itself.  I wish there were words in the English language to do the evening justice.   So I will settle on being grateful for that 3.5 hours with my daughter.   It will stay with us forever.
11/4/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Ticketmaster sucks but I sat in front of it refreshing the page for 2 hours to get my seats behind the stage for $49
11/4/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This concert was AMAZING!!! I had so much fun seeing Taylor Swift live for the first time. All aspects of the show from the music selection to the visual production were amazing. I would 100% go again.
11/3/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Something I wish I could do every weekend. The energy is electric. My sister and I turned this concert into a sister vacation to Nola and it will likely be one of the best life moments for a very long time.
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Loved this venue, it was so fun to see NOLA so alive and small businesses thriving with the ERAS tour in town...AND THE SHOW was a once in lifetime performance from an artist that makes the crowd feel like they are her best audience. Never a dull moment...every song choreographed leaving everyone entertained for over 3 hours!!"
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Nola N3 was truly the best night of my life! Taylor and Gracie’s performances were incredible and words cannot express how out of this world the night was!! I had obstructed view nosebleed tickets, but there is truly no bad seat in the stadium. I would go again and again a million times!"
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We LOVE Taylor Swift! She delivers every single time! Taylor IS the artist of the XXI Century! Can’t wait to see her in the next tour!
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Ms Swift is the best performer out there. This isn’t just a concert, it’s a once in a lifetime experience that I am so grateful to have attended. The most amazing choreography, and obviously her setlist is absolutely insane. I loved this show so much <3"
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I still can't believe we got tickets!!! It was a once in a lifetime chance to see a once in a lifetime show. Tickets opened up on Friday night for N2 in NOLA, and we miraculously got regular priced floor seats! We drove 12 hours back and forth in 24 hours to see Taylor put on the most amazing, heartstopping, emotional rollercoaster of a show. I am still riding the high of this experience! It was my first Taylor Swift show, and I can't believe I got to have this experience!!! So so so blessed and thankful!"
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that left me absolutely speechless! From the very first note to the final encore, Taylor Swift brought every era of her music to life in a way that was both nostalgic and electrifying. The production value was insane—stunning visuals, flawless choreography, and a seamless flow from one era to the next that felt like a journey through time. Taylor’s voice sounded incredible live, and you could feel her passion with every lyric.

What made it even more magical was the crowd energy—thousands of fans singing every word and waving lights synchronized to the music. It was like being part of a massive celebration, with each song bringing back memories and hitting all the feels. The Eras Tour isn’t just a concert; it’s an emotional rollercoaster and a testament to how much her music means to so many people. Truly unforgettable! If you’re a Swiftie or just love live music, this tour is everything you could hope for and more."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It was me & my 8-yo daughter’s 1st time to see Taylor, 1st time to travel w/on my husband & her very 1st concert attendancd. Taylor’s performance was the absolute best - no dull moment even in between Eras & costume changes. She truly brought the house down. I will never forget the experience & I’m sure my daughter won’t either! Thank you Taylor for giving your fans an experience of a lifetime."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We had a great time.  Venue was easy to navigate.  Seats were great.  Taylor never disappoints
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"While I haven't been a certified Swiftie for very long, The Eras Tour has been on my bucket list since she announced it 2 years ago. Taylor did not disappoint with this show and neither did the venue. We saw her in NOLA (which made for an amazing trip on its own) and the Superdome was great. The crowd was electric and we even got a surprise guest on night 2. I danced, cried, and screamed the lyrics to my favorite songs along with 65,000 other Swifties. 
I just wish Ticketmaster didn't have such a monopoly on live events and allow scalpers to get tickets instead of fans."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Wow. and I mean wow. This was my first concert ever, and I had such a blast at the Eras Tour. I am so grateful to have seen Taylor. She has been my idol since I was little, and seeing her in person versus on a grainy livestream? It is a major difference. The energy in the audience was unreal, and just the environment made me feel so safe. Seeing everyone in harmony loving something as much as me made me feel like we were all a family. The synchronized light up bracelets were such a good add on so that Taylor could see each and every one of us. I absolutely will forever treasure being a part of this amazing journey of Taylor's, as this truly was a core memory in my heart."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Everything about the Eras tour was spectacular!! Taylor Swift is so talented. Her sets are amazing and the fans are the best!!
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"For its length and well reported profitability, I am disappointed that consideration and improvements weren’t made to the stage set-up so that people seated on the ends / sides of the stage couldn’t see the main backdrop behind the performers. When viewed from the front of the stage the show is much more dynamic. I don’t feel like my kids or I got the full experience and I paid an exorbitant amount for what looked like good seats online. My kids had fun, but, as a consumer I was disappointed.  That said, I appreciated the positive atmosphere and demeanor of the staff at the Superdome."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The NOLA Superdome was a spacious and inviting venue.  Walking distance to several bars and restaurants (though not many were still open when the show closed).  Venue served food, water, and alcohol.  Restrooms were neat and tidy.  Venue attendants and vendors were all cheerful and pleasant.  Will return to the Superdome for future events."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The best concert I have ever been too. New Orleans put the red carpet out for visitors going to the show.
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Made memories at this concert that I will NEVET forget! The venue was surprisingly organized, full of nice people and halfway affordable (except the alcoholic drinks!) 

Taylor is an absolutely phenomenal performer that doesn't let a snag ruin her show. We love her ❤️"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The lights, Taylor's vocals, the dancers and band. Even down to the wrist bands, this was such an amazing concert. I even hyped it up in my mind and it still didn't compare. There's nothing like it. I cried and sang along with my friends. Screamed bridges and applauded our hearts out. Lost my voice. I wish I could go again. I don't feel my words do it justice. Thank you, Taylor!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This was an amazing night and an incredible experience. Wish I could do it all over again. The Eras Tour was a night I’ll never forget. 10/10.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The whole experience was so smooth and effortless. There wasn't a single thing that didn't go by smoothly and it was very clear that a lot of thought and planning went into making sure that everything an easy process for the fans and I am so thankful for that. The opener was amazing and surpassed all of my expectations and I will be tuning into her music from now on! Gracie truly did a AMAZING job and I'm so grateful to have experienced her contagious energy that perfectly prepared the crowd for what was to come. Taylor was a force to be reckoned with. She was BORN to be a performer and it's so clear in person. Her attention to detail in each set is absolutely unmatched, from the AMAZING live band to the lights illuminating the crowd, costumes, props, choreography etc. The dancers seem to respect her so much and always seem like they are having the time of their lives. You can tell she has so much love and pride for what she does because it shines through so heavily in all of her ventures, ESPECIALLY this one. She was glowing the whole night and gave us THE unforgettable experience of a lifetime. Words cannot describe how amazing this concert was and I will cherish it forever and always!"

10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Wow, this was the most incredible night of my life, from watching Gracie Abrams performing and crying and watching her sing Risk because it was just so special. Then Taylor came on. It is one of the best experiences ever to see someone I have loved since I was six.  I don't just love her music; I look up to her as a woman, and seeing her up there inspired me so much to work hard and chase my dreams. Long live all the magic we made. I remember it all too well."
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The concert event was well setup for the amount of people there. The town was prepared and very efficient to keep everyone fed and housed. It was the biggest production I have ever seen and would recommend anyone to see her show. My family had a great time youth and adults. Police were everywhere and homeland security so I felt very safe. The streets were closed for walking traffic to and from the event also which was massive for me to see.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I loved everything about the show and the venue. Not only did the venue welcome the Taylor swift fans and Taylor swift herself but everyone was just so nice. The show itself was amazing and there was not one person who wasn’t dancing in the 60,000 plus seated stadium even those who accompanied someone. Thanks so much for a night WE will never forget."
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This concert was nothing short of amazing! My daughter & I had an great time, as did some friends of ours. Taylor Swift has this superpower to make a show more than just a show, it is a full on experience & her audience loves it. I heard so many times, “I wasn’t a Swiftie before, but I am now.” She keeps the crowd engaged from beginning to end for over 3 hours."
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It was the best experience ever, especially for my first concert. Definitely set high expectations. Gracie Abrams, Taylor Swift, AND Sabrina Carpenter. Was I dreaming???"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The Eras Tour is pure fun! I took my 12 yo daughter and we had seen the film and plenty of social media videos to know what we were going to witness. Bit to see it in person and to feel the excitement of the entire crowd is an unbelievable experience.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Seeing the ERAS Tour, NOLA was a once in a lifetime experience with 3 of my adult children and 2 grandkids. Amazing!!!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"There is nothing to even compare this to…I have seen a lot of concerts and this show was an experience. The energy and excitement leading up to and during the show just made everything even better!  Every set was unique, beautiful and magical."

Thank you Taylor for all you do in showing ours kids how to be a strong independent woman that can conquer the world!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"There is a reason these tickets are so coveted, and after all the hype of having bought them from the pre-sale, the concert itself was so worth it. Absolutely breathtaking, an experience unlike any other. The tremendous effort put in by Taylor, Gracie, the bands, the dancers, the stage crew, the designers, and everyone is plainly evident. Each moment was curated perfection, we all felt a part of something much bigger than us from the very atmosphere in the dome. If you are able to get tickets, consider it an honor! Prepare for one of the most unforgettable nights of your life."

10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Awesome experience!  It was organized and efficient getting into the venue, the seats were great, Gracie Abrams was an awesome starting act, Taylor Swift and her crew were absolutely incredible, the vibe of the concertgoers was electric and it was organized and efficient leaving the venue as well.  Incredible experience all the way around! The Eras Tour is a must see!"

10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor gave a phenomenal performance. Her outfits were beautiful and her voice is even more amazing live. There was a stage malfunction and you would have never known as Taylor did not miss a beat. The atmosphere was electric and the vibe was just so good. New Orleans and Taylor combined is my new favorite thing in the world.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was one of the best concerts I've ever been too. It was easy to get in the venue once I had tickets. The concert was amazing i mean of course it was, Taylor Swift is the best."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,OG Swiftie here and NOLA N3 was literally the best experience! We had an amazing time! Taylor makes everyone so happy and spreads so much joy! So glad we were able to attend!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor was amazing! It was a memory making experience. Everything about it was incredible. I only hope to be so lucky to see her perform again one day.
1/31/25,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"From start to finish it was a smooth process. Parking was very expensive, t it the venue is great! Taylor swift put on one of the best live shows I’ve ever seen. Her surprise songs were definitely the songs my friend I were showed to get. It was rare I was there. I remember it (or not so) Well"
12/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert was awesome. Great seats. But we never received our VIP box. Very disappointed.
11/25/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The eras tour was an experience of a lifetime!! I’ve never been to a concert like this one! Taylor puts on an amazing show singing some of her greatest hits. The outfits, choreography, and everything is just so perfectly executed."
11/22/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I saw Morgan wallen at Lucas oil and the music quality was eh. I was nervous for Taylor bc I read online that the acoustics weren’t great to performers in there - but Taylor was amazing!! I was in the nose bleeds and still had an amazing experience. The show started on time and it was so amazing and worth the money! Best concert ever!
11/20/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I could never say enough good things about this tour. It was everything my daughter and I could have dreamed of. The fight to get tickets was horrendous, but the venue itself was amazing. The security team was phenomenal, everyone we interacted with was so kind, and the merch stands were set up very well considering how busy they were. It was easy to get to our seats and find the nearest restroom. I loved that because of the demographic, men’s restrooms were converted to women’s as well, I never had to wait in line more than a few minutes. And the concert itself was the absolute best concert I’ve ever been to hands-down, the production is insane."
11/14/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"As a fan of over 18-19 years. It was always my dream to see Taylor in concert! Seeing the eras tour was one of the most magical experiences and nights of my life! The whole experience and atmosphere of being with thousands of other swifties just being ourselves and having the absolute best time! It was a healing moment for the younger self in me in such a way I never thought possible! The kindness and love shown everywhere throughout the concert was incredible! And it was all because of Taylor Swift and her whole team for putting on such a beautiful performance for over 69,000 people! We were so lucky to have gotten to go and if we could we would do it a thousand times more! Just amazing! Thank Taylor Swift for everything and being the most loving and fun person that you are! Being a fan of you just makes life a little easier-all thanks to you and your wonderful team!"
11/14/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I truly had the best time of my entire life seeing Taylor in concert! The show doesn’t feel like it’s 3.5 hours long because you’re just having so much fun!
11/12/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Of course this is 5 stars. No notes. Taylor is the queen of entertainment for a reason.
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Taylor Swift concert was Fantastic and Amazing, of course.  The experience of using Ticketmaster was Terrible - Long wait times, uncertain times of tickets dropping, finally being in the Queue, only to get to the front of the line, here we go, let's buy tickets... Only to be kicked out and told tickets were gone. Then able to get back in the Queue... And the same thing over again. Ticketmaster needs to do better. And needs to weed out sales to scalpers!!"
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Best concert experience of my life. Everyone was friendly dancing in the aisles. All security treated all fans well. Gracie Abram’s was fantastic & Taylor flawless and wonderful, beyond our expectations."
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift was such an amazing experience! She put on a beautiful show and performed for more than three hours! We loved second!!
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It was such an amazing experience finally seeing Taylor in person after purchasing tickets well over a year ago. Her voice is truly ethereal, I would go 10 times over if I could"
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Beautiful performance, inspiring lyrics and embodiment of female empowerment and so much fun."
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I thought her concert was phenomenal. The part that was bad was getting our wrist band to get to the floor level.  Very unorganized and took forever, in the longest line, missed all the preshow. When you pay that much money you should get all you need as you go through the ticket line and not another line."
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Concert was beyond amazing, because she is amazing. Outstanding performance and production"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert started on time .  Taylor sang and danced her heart out.  The dresses and dances are amazing!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,this was such an amazing show! i love taylor so much and ticketmaster allowed me to see her!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was truly the best night ever!! I went to Taylor with my girlfriend's and we had the best time! It was amazing screaming the songs together. I have been a swifty for forever and am SO grateful I got tickets to the Era's tour!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The show was incredible! It was my second time going to the Eras tour. It was way better than the first time because I got to see the TTPD set! I wish I could go again!! Gracie Abrams and Taylor Swift were amazing!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Everything went perfect. The stars must of been aligned for us. We were able to score great seats! Entering the venue was quick and easy. The show was so spectacular!!! The excitement of the whole stadium was infectious! The energy in the room was something that I’ve never before experienced! Thank you Taylor for the amazing show and the memories of sharing it with my girls…priceless ❤️
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I was lucky enough to get 2 tickets to see Taylor Swift night 2 in Indy. I got the tickets a month in advance and they immediately appeared in my account with a count down to when I was able to transfer them. I was also lucky that I was not one of many who got scammed. I received my tickets on the date it had promised and was able to transfer them to my phone right away! The seats were right together, although I was not aware that our seats were against a concrete barrier where people come in and out/up and down the stares. If I had purchased 1 ticket over myself and brother would have been split between this wall. Again I was lucky that, that wasn’t the case and we had the best night ever."
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor puts on an amazing show.  3 and 1/2 hours of music. Definitely worth every penny. Plus Taylor has the nicest fans!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert we have ever attended. The people around us were very friendly and we were trading bracelets and decorated sunglasses. It we just special.
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Probably the best concert I’ve ever been to. My seat was in section 625, but I could still see everything and it was an amazing concert. She really knows how to put on a show and all the people I was around were super friendly."
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert I have ever attended.  The atmosphere was electric and she did an amazing job.  One song after another without hardly a break.  So glad I was able to experience it!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Great show fabulous. Taylor Swift is pure talent undoubtedly.
The only issue and disappointment was that Taylor Swift did not sing that extra 20 minutes after 11.00 pm on Sunday show like she did for the Friday and Saturday shows. There were no surprise songs and she did not sing Reputation. I was very disheartened. If she did that for the Friday and Saturday shows, she should have also been fair for the Sunday show. 
But my dream come true to see her live on stage was just mesmerizing. She is still the BEST. LOVE YOU TAYLOR

Yours truly
A true Swifty"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Everything about it was amazing! From the crowds heading towards the venue, the entry process, and navigating the venue, it all went smoothly. I also loved the  additional screens we could view especially sine my 7 year old needed a nap at 10 pm in order to last through the end of the night. I was able to watch the show from my seat as she slept. The noise was INSANE! I am so glad I brough ear protection for my daughter AND for me! Though it was ear-piercingly loud, the sound was amazing. Taylor did a phenomenal job at keeping everyone (all 69k of us) engaged. 
I will say we were slightly disappointed that there were not surprises or anything on night 3 of Indy, which was the final US show ever. But alas, happy to be there!"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift puts on such an amazing show!! Everyone should get to experience a Taylor Swift concert at least once in their life. The best performer!!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor was amazing! We kept talking about how she puts on a 3-1/2hr show and doesn’t take a break! Then she goes to do it three nights in a row! I work an 8 hour day sitting at a desk and I’m exhausted! She was built for this! The show was flawless!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was my second time seeing Taylor. My daughter was in heaven and it made me so happy to see her so happy 🥰.  The show itself was AMAZING!! She put on a great show from start to finish. We were on our feet and dancing the whole time.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I was so excited to attend the eras tour. Got my tickets through verified fan in August 2023 and had been looking forward to it for nearly 15 months. After Gracie’s set, we went to the bathroom before Taylor came on. Unfortunately, my husband passed out and needed stitches and further evaluation due to the trauma sustained to his face. We missed the entire show. I am completely heartbroken and devastated. My husband is okay and that is of the upmost importance. It still stings to have had to sit this one out. Once in a lifetime…I saw some videos from N3 and heard rave reviews. I know it was a great show, Taylor always gives 100% and is one of the best entertainers of our time. Now I’m just praying I can manage to snag Toronto tickets and finally get to see the show!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Not only was the atmosphere of the concert the most supportive and welcoming place I have ever been to, but the show was incredible. From the opener to the visuals, the entire show was so well-planned and entertaining. The dancers were so talented and really made you feel so included. The chants and bracelets added so much. I have never seen a concert like this!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Never a bad moment, never a bad seat, and always an amazing performance! Absolutely incredible and no doubt worth every second! Every act a solid 10/10."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This is a once in a lifetime concert. Taylor puts on a show like no other artist. We had the best time ever.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The best show ever she truly loves and cares for her fans and we love her back it’s something I will always look forward to miss Taylor’s swift NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!!!! I will always try to go see her everytime!!!!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The Eras Tour was amazing! Incredible. There are no words to properly describe this insane experience! Haha. wow! It was rare. I was there.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"First,  Taylor Swift is AMAZING!!! What an amazing show she put on! From start to finish,  our  experience with ticketmaster and the Lucas Oil venue was absolutely great! I was one of the lucky verified fans who got an access code. My girls and I were so so excited to be able to watch Taylor for the first time! The venue was clean and great seating with great views no matter where you sit! Hoping to go to many more Taylor Swift concerts!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The ultimate concert experience! I hope everyone gets to go to a Taylor Swift concert at some point in their life!! Even if you aren’t a swiftie! To see her show is an insane experience!! So happy we got to attend the last ever US eras tour show

11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,10/10 night Taylor really knows how to put on a show. More of an experience than a concert
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I’m not sure I’ll ever stop talking about experiencing The Eras Tour in Indy with one of my best friends. It’s hard to put into words just how incredible her show was. You could feel the passion she poured into every single detail, every single second and I can’t imagine the effort and care it took to create that experience for us.
She made us feel like we were part of something so special. Indy, thank you for an unforgettable night, and Taylor—thank you for sharing your magic with us! Your fans love you!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert was amazing! She is an incredible performer and continuously for over 3 hours! Our seats were high up but we were able to enjoy every minute!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"There’s no words to explain how amazing Taylor performs. This was my second time seeing her and it was a dream come true to see the Eras tour on the last U.S show. Until next time Taylor, long live🫶🏻"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,My daughters and I were able to finally experience the magic that is the Eras tour in person and it’s did not disappoint! The atmosphere since we set foot in the stadium was something we have never felt before. All staff was beyond friendly. You would think that it might have been a stressful event with so many people present but it was actually the opposite.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,We loved every minute of it! Taylor is amazing! Gracie also was wonderful!! Thank you ladies for an extraordinary night. #GIRLPOWER
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Words cannot describe how amazing this show was. I knew it was going to be great, and I was still shocked at how much better it was than I could have imagined. Magical."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Thank you Taylor and your whole team for a wonderful night of dancing, music, a show, lights and so much fun!! EXCELLENT"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The concert and Taylor Swift were great.  We were section 638, row 21, and our seats were absolutely obstructed.  If I stood up, I could see the point of the middle diamond of the stage, and if I sat my view was blocked by people standing.  There was this overhang thing from the ceiling that blocked our view.  I wish I had bought obstructed view tickets because at least I could have seen a Jumbotron :("
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I was going to this show to take my daughter.  It was the best concert I have ever attended.  I am a converted Swiftie now and can’t stop thinking about how amazing it was.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The city welcomed all the TS fans with open arms and created a safe, fun and exciting city to all who came to town. The show that Taylor put on was amazing, but honestly, that is an understatement. I can't even find words to describe the event. I do know that it will be a concert that I will remember for the rest of my life and I was so happy to experience it with my 11yo daughter. You could just feel the positivity electrify you as you walked around the stadium before the show. It was a safe space for everyone to truly be themselves with no judgement! Lucas Oil Stadium was a fantastic venue to see this concert. The sounds was top notch! I would definitely go back to see a concert at this venue and with 100% see Taylor Swift on her next concert excursion, whenever that is. :)"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Love Taylor so much! She was amazing and the concert was epic. Ticketmaster… do better.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"we had seats in the 600s level of Lucas Oil Stadium and I can confirm no seat is a bad seat at a Taylor Swift concert. The visuals, performance, and choreography were mind blowing and there was not a single person in the room that was not engaged. Ms. Swift put on a performance of a lifetime and had a great time doing it. The care and love for her fans and her staff was apparent. If I had the chance to go again I would no matter what the cost."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I had the absolute time of my life!!! best concert i’ve ever been to. drove almost 10 hours there and back and would do it all over again
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Second Era's Tour show Night 1 was Cincy Night 2 and This show was Indy Night 3.  This show was Fantastic.  Started out with a Brilliant performance from Gracie.  She was an absolute delight and her music is so good still can't stop singing her songs.  Then Ms. Swift adding the TTPD set and felt like an entire new show from before. Vocals were amazing the dancing the band the backup singers all were terrific.  This was my favorite concert EVER !!! I'm sad that's its ending but so thankful and lucky to have seen the last US show of this historic event and already counting the days until she's back on tour.   Please take as much time as you need and we will miss and see you again soon.  ❤️🥰.  Love you Tay. Thanks for everything.  Thank you Gracie Sabrina and everyone else who performed with you special guests.  All the dancers backup singers the Band. All the crew that helped set it all up and take it down and anyone else involved.  Oh and Travis of course keep slaying Brother.   ❤️❤️❤️❤️
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I went with my daughter to the Eras tour in Indy.  It was her first ever concert and my first since Covid.  The show was amazing and Taylor was electric.  I feel that my daughter will be ruined for future concerts if she is expecting the headliner to be on stage for 3.5 hours.   Everything about the concert itself was great (crowd, lights, sound, performers, etc). 

My complaints have to do with merchandise and food.  The lines were long and wait was horrendous.  We waited an hour in one of the merch lines.  I ordered and paid for a pizza and then had to wait 10 minutes for it to be ready.  Those two things combined caused me to miss the opening act.  

All things considered I did enjoy myself and would recommend for everyone to see this show regardless of fandom."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"She is the most talented musician I have ever seen live. I need her cardio routine. She is absolutely insane in the best way. I will never forget this tour. Also, her Mom waved at us!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This isn’t just a Concert.  This is a spectacular production put on by an amazing Woman!  This was My first time seeing Taylor Swift in Concert.  I’ve been an OG Fan since Debut!  I’ve just never had the opportunity to see her in Concert before.  I hope I can do it again soon!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Best show I’ve ever seen, nothing can top it besides Taylor swift again probably! Amazing. Me and my mom had the best night ever"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It has been my dream since I was a little girl to watch Taylor Swift perform at a concert.  The little girl inside of me was rebuilt on November 3rd at her last USA show in Indianapolis, Indiana. When I got the email that I had received with the pre-sale code to access these tickets, I was in utter disbelief that this was real, then actually managing to get seats shocked me more.  The seats I had were a perfect view of the stage and it was truly magical.  I definitely will be on the lookout for any future tours Taylor Swift decides to do because she is such a fun person that loves interacting with the crowd. Ticketmaster made sure that my tickets were safe from August 2023 until November 3rd 2024, and I want to thank them for making sure they were secure.  Without the security Ticketmaster has, I would not have been able to watch my favorite artist on stage.  If you have never gone to a Taylor Swift concert, you are missing out.  It is such a magical experience being there."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I think that this night was something I truely will never forget. I drive ten hours and I would do it times one hundred in order to see that show again. She is such an incredible human for performing like that. I really wouldn’t know what I would do without her. Surprise songs. Don’t even get me started…
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"2nd time to see the Eras Tour, and it was as magnificent and magical as the first time. The price of the resale tickets was absolutely gut wrenching, but the show itself was worth every penny."
3/18/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"By far one of the best concert experiences of my life, I'd do anything to go back!! It was a magical, fantastic feeling especially after all my sister and I went through to get the tickets and arrive at the concert. I could not feel more grateful!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2/26/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor was amazing!! The overall Eras Tour from the moment walking into the stadium, seeing the stage for the first time to Gracie's opening act and the production building up the excitement, to finally seeing Taylor was an experience of a lifetime. She really put a lot of hard work and thought into creating a special and memorable experience for her swifties, giving it her all performing from era to era. I would have loved to see her perform Long Live but hopefully she will add that ""permanently""to the setlist on her next upcoming tour! :)"
2/23/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,My first concert ever.Worth the wait from ticket registration via Avion up to the day of the concert.Thank you for the amazing experience.
12/13/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"There really is no better concert to see performed live, it just hits different! The energy really makes sparks fly like your wildest dreams. The Toronto Rogers Centre was a great sized venue where even the nosebleed seats don't make you feel exiled. Long live Taylor Swift, I had the best day. This tour will go down like folklore."
12/12/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was unforgettable and worth every penny. There is a reason that Taylor Swift is the music industry. Would love to relive this experience over and over again.

12/1/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It’s the only website I use for buying tickets. I was fortunate to take my daughter to see Mama Mia for the first time and her idol Taylor Swift this year. She is a big Swiftie. My daughter said it doesn’t get better than this!!   She was over the moon!! Thank you Ticketmaster!!
12/1/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift was fantastic! The arena was electric with high energy and anticipation as the clock ticked down to the opening. I had tears & goose bumps when she appeared to open her show. I watched the fans around me, of all ages, singing along. I watched the lights throughout the audience and stage, and it was incredible how it all worked together, so impressive! The coreography, dancers, singers were great and they looked like they were having fun. 
Most impressive was Taylor's performance! Over 3 hours of, singing, dancing, playing guitar and piano... high energy & emotion throughout. It was an experience I will never forget!"
11/30/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"We were absolutely blown away with the production of this tour! It was easy to find our seats, the staff were absolutely wonderful to deal with and the line ups were managed well by the staff. What can I say about Taylor? The performance was phenomenal and out of this world! My only complaint was that the drinks were VERY expensive! I spent $15 on a popcorn and $74 on TWO drinks!!!! Woah... Other than that the night was amazing!"
11/30/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Once in a lifetime experience. The greatest show I’ve ever seen. Taylor is incredible.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"oh my god. can't even describe how special and amazing that concert was. guys if you have the opportunity to see the last shows of her tour, DO IT! money comes back around but this tour and the memories with it never will.. thank you taylor for everything you've done to make it unforgettable ❤️"
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The effects were crazy and she was so amazing and from whatever seat you were in you could see clearly from the screen.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Eras Tour was an absolutely magnificent experience. It was so much more than just a concert. I had the time of my life trading friendship bracelets, chatting with Swifties, interacting with all of the venue staff, and watching this once-in-a-lifetime performance by the most talented artist. Taylor is so sincere and genuine, and it's obvious that she puts everything she has into putting on the best show for her audience. I've been to many concerts, but I've never been a part of something as special as the Eras Tour. Taylor's band and dancers were incredible. The stage itself was such a marvel. The entire production of this show was remarkable. I feel very lucky to have been able to witness Taylor Swift perform. It had, indeed, been a long time coming, and I'll remember it for the rest of my life...all too well. :)"
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor was AMAZING NO words BEST concert ever!!!   Hats off to Roger’s Centre well organized.  Staff very friendly, on time. Well done Toronto.  Came from Montreal."
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Wow, such an amazing show!!! So glad we had the chance to experience the Eras Tour. It absolutely lived up to the hype. Taylor is an incredible performer… the energy was incredible from start to finish. Gracie was fantastic as well to get things started!"
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Obviously expectations were high for Taylor Swift but the whole event was amazing and met those expectations. Everything was so organized and the staff were very friendly. The only thing I would comment on was that I wish our gate was a little closer to our seats but it wasn’t too far so other than that everything was brilliant.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I was able to bring my daughter this time( my second time seeing Taylor on Eras Tour) and it was such an incredible experience to have with her on her 13th birthday. I am a huge Swiftie, but I feel like even if you don’t like her or her music there is no way you could go to one of her concerts and not appreciate what she does on stage and off. She brings people together and it is truly an experience of a lifetime."
11/28/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The most incredible show I’ve ever experienced. I need to go again. She sounded so good and did an amazing job. Still cannot stop thinking about it.
11/28/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"this concert was the best concert I’ve been to and I saw a lot of good pop girlies this year like olivia Rodrigo and tate mcrae, and much more and it was everything thing I needed to be and I miss it so much I love you so much taylor you NEVER disappoint :)"
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I had an Eras Tour ticket transferred from a friend, and the process was incredibly smooth and secure. It showed up in my account instantly, and getting into the venue was seamless."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The best show I have ever seen, in 2024 I saw over 30 artists but Taylor was definitely the most memorable!!!"
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I had the best time seeing Taylor Swift! She is a spectacular performer and the energy in the room was insane. Some of the most happiest moments of my life occurred at Taylor Swift. A truly unforgettable experience!
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What an amazing artist and performance, if you can some how manage to go.. then do it! Be aware that you will become an instant 'Swiftie' after seeing the Eras Tour.

I do wish that Ticketmaster was more regulated and that surge pricing/ and the resales of tickets for 10 times the original price were not able to occur.  This would prevent the hacking and scamming that follows suit.  I was so stressed out about potentially have my tickets hacked from my account.  None of that would have to occur if TM wasn't allowed to inflate the prices and or allow the resellers to do the same."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"One of the best concerts I’ve ever seen! The set design, the music, the dancing, all of it was easily one of the best concerts I’ve ever seen."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was the best concert I’ve ever been to and the best I’ll ever go to. Taylor Swift is the whole package, and I think I’ll be in a post-Eras Tour depression for a very long time."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This concert experience was amazing!! Everything was perfect except there was an obstructed view which we were not aware of until we arrived at our seats. But Taylors performance was so amazing!!!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a moment in time! This Taylor Swift show was incredible from the opening act to the last lyrics sung! An unforgettable performance with the highest quality delivery! WOW! When does she return?…
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was amazing, magical!!   So grateful to have the chance to attend!
Something needs to be done about ticketing & resellers.  Two empty seats in front of me for such a high demand event.. Shocking!!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The entire night was amazing! No lines waiting outside to get into the event great flow! When inside the vibe was great! So much happiness in one place! Both Gracie and Taylor put on amazing performances! Taylor sang her heart out for hours and entertained the audience the entire time! Best night, best concert EVER!!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was absolutely amazing. However, I could not see Taylor Swift for more than half of the concert. I was in section 534 and it was not noted as an obstructed view. She and her dancers were often hidden by the tower. It was such a disappointment and I would not have picked these seats had they been identified as an obstructed view."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was a once in a lifetime show! It was amazing. Taylor and her team know how to entertain. Every detail was carefully and thoughtfully planned out.
The venue was good, and everything went smoothly! Cannot recommend this show enough!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a great night I think this concert was even better than the last one I went to on the eras tour . Great stadium!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Awesome event. Made my daughter’ birthday!! Beautiful sets. Amazing choreography. Taylor spent max three minutes to change between eras. That’s some coordination!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Once in a lifetime experience! It was incredible! The performance, the ambiance and everything was excellent!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Great entrance arrangement, easy entry, found seats easily, performance was spectacular, best event I have ever gone too. Liked the interm performances during outfit changes. Taylor did the stage walk (stage was huge with sections that lifted) so everyone got a closer look. Huge screen meant you saw everything even if they were facing the opposite direction. Huge thank you to everyone involved."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The concert was amazing and Taylor is incredible! Gracie was awesome as well. My daughter had the best night of her life
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was such an emotional experience for me! Being in the audience with so many fans and singing my heart out was such an incredible feeling.  TS is such an amazing artist and everything about her stage presence, the choreography with the dancers,  and the stage design is perfectly thought out. I feel so lucky to have been a part of the ERA’s tour experience."

11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I had one of the best nights of my life at The Eras Tour Night 5 at Rogers Centre! Everything ran smoothly, staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Everything was fantastic including the show itself - no other concert will ever come close to this one! Absolutely amazing show put off my Taylor and her team! I wish I could have gone to all 6 nights!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor never disappoints, her concert is nothing short of spectacular. Roger’s Centre did a great job with signage, directing people and were very friendly. I can’t wait to see her again!!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This experience was amazing. Aside from me having major anxiety over getting a presale code/tickets for this concert, everything was amazing! We had the best night and everything was better than I could’ve imagined. So wish I could go again!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor has the BEST concert ever. Ticketmaster needs to figure out their resale problem though because getting tickets was ridiculous
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Amazing. Wonderful. Emotional.
Words aren't enough. It is in the heart and soul."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I have been to two different eras tour shows, if never gets old."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Had an amazing experience!  No issues at all !  Can't wait to go to another concert!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What a great performance by Taylor Swift.  The lights, sounds, pyrotechnics, dancing, imagery and videos.  It was the caliber of show you would expect and won't be disappointed."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I saw the Eras tour in LA and it was amazing. Something about Toronto and the changes to her concert, made this one even better. Can’t believe this tour is about to end, what a ride!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor is personally my favourite singer and has been since I was a kid. She was amazing, everything about that concert was beautiful. Her voice really was magical, and it was legendary. I’m so grateful and lucky I got to go, and I would not trade that day for anything else in this world. Love you Taylor❤️"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"So lovely to be with my daughters and granddaughter in attendance. The concert was timely, organized, secure and safe, no massive line-ups anywhere. It was a wonderful experience."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,One of the best nights of my life. But can you lower ticket prices for all concerts. Like. Dang
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This was the show of the century. We bought obstructed view tickets and ended up being moved closed to the floor. A perfect night. I remember it all too well
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It had been a long time comin….we miraculously got tickets and waited over a year for the concert of a lifetime! It did not disappoint. I went with my mom and two daughters and to say it is a core life memory for all of us, is an understatement! We loved every second! From Gracie opening, to Karma confetti, the entire night was incredible! I’d give anything to go again!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Truly the best experience ever - Taylor Swift puts on a bigger than life show that is worth every penny and then some! If you only go to one concert this decade, the Era’s Tour is the one not to miss! Our whole family enjoyed every moment of the evening and can’t wait to see what’s next for Taylor… 3.5 hours flew by in the blink of an eye!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was the most amazing experience of my life. If you have the chance to see your favorite artist do it! You will never regret it!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I mean come on…it’s Taylor swift. She is the best and she is doing it the best right now. It’s an experience not just a concert. Ticketmaster should have made it easier for more people to get tickets but it was the best I’ve ever been to
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,the best show I have ever seen I’ve been a huge Taylor Swift fan almost my entire life and getting eras tour tickets well it was no small feat it was worth the wait time and effort. Everything in the show was truly amazing and honestly a spectacle ! From the opening to the closing everything was perfectly on point and nothing felt out of place or boring from era to era the show was phenomenal. Even for someone who isn’t a big Taylor fan would still probably love this show ! The energy of the audience was amazing though and through
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was the best night of my lifeee! I would love to go to Vancouver but didn’t get access
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a force to be reckon with. The joy and girlhood that she brings to a place when she comes is truly remarkable. The performance is at a Michael Jackson level of entertainment. The best to do it ever without a doubt.
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The Eras Tour was hands down the best concert I ever went to. She is so generous with her time. Over 3 hours of top notch performances.
