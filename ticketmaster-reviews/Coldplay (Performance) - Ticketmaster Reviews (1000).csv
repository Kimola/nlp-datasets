9/30/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"My Coldplay concert experience was amazing!  What a show - so uplifting and fun!  Everyone I encountered working at the venue was friendly and helpful.  The only drawback were the people in the standing room (Toyota Fan Deck?) area near my seat (Section 320 Aisle I Seat 20) who were laughing and talking loudly during the last part of the concert.  Loud enough that it was difficult to hear Chris sing from C-Stage.  This was my first Coldplay concert, and though it feels dramatic to say so, it was transformative.  My thoughts keep going back to how it felt to be there, and the feelings and ideas that have stayed with me.  Thank you, Coldplay and Lumen employees, for gifting me with such a meaningful experience."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"070 Shake was good, H.E.R. Was very good and many folks sang along.  Her more fast and guitar rock pumped the crowd. She could tour as a main event also. But Coldplay gave such an exciting show with dramatic entry, pyrotech, and lighting.  Armbands were fun, but fireworks were awesome.  My family and I will attend another when they return. Thank you!!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The band and warmup bands were excellent, but the folks at Snapdragon Stadium did not have an orderly system for ridesharing after the concert.  I recommend that there be a more defined place for ride sharing, perhaps more in a corner parking lot.  It took many fans 2-3 hours to catch a ride because of poor labeling for Lyft and Uber, and no smooth entry and exit for drivers."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This is the best concert I have been to so far. The LED bracelets make you feel part of the show, as if you are part of the band. Amazing feeling hearing them live"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I loved this concert so much it was so welcoming to everyone there. It was such a sweet and memorable concert and just a very vibrant and alive, and crowd engaging!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The staff was more than helpful in every question I had. I had 300 level seats and decided last minute to get floor seats and the website had an issue so I was worried about getting charged without getting the tickets. Thankfully the staff was very reassuring and helped me with the whole situation. Despite not getting floor seats I still had such an amazing time! Friendly staff and the stadium was clean and organized!
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Best day in my life thanks to Coldplay ü´∂üåè‚ú®üí´üí•‚ù§Ô∏è, a life changing experience simply amazing and magical and thank you ticketmaster for making it possibleüôåüèº"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"A great explosion of energy and connection, a great group with an incredible sense of social responsibility. Chris, Guy, Jonny & Will, they are the top üôå"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay was excellent. We had an amazing time. They didn‚Äôt disappoint and the Snapdragon stadium was awesome, as well. Great memories!!!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Everything about seeing Coldplay live is incredible. Their show is truly a show, the lights, the stage setup, the confetti, the wristbands, all of it. Chris Martin is an entertainer and he makes up for the fact that none of the others are. 
Every song they play is a treat for the truest fan or the casual fan who only knows their hits. All n all, it is one of the greatest shows you‚Äôll ever experience‚Ä¶.til you see them again."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Coldplay was amazing.  The energy and love they send out throughout the whole time on stage is incredible.  I could watch them everyday.  Every song has so much emotion it‚Äôs hard not to cry.  If you have never seen them you gotta put it on your bucket list. Highly recommended.
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Very organised, love Coldplay, sang all of their hits. Very energetic, beautiful night of music. H.E.R is incredible! Was not a fan of the person who opened for H.E.R. This venue usually will have / had in attendance kids of all ages , fan of Coldplay and H.E.R, should at least be warned that person who will open up to H.E.R will have an E rated song material and visuals ."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I have to say that this being my very first concert at this stadium me and my family too much to desire, starting with the access to  the stadium witch haves some much space to park but hard to get in too, the venue very impressive set up, good security services but don't know how to direct people and poor people skills to deal with the customers especially when the customer is younger than themselves, I'm born on 73 and I have to deal with them all the time soo yes they need to be trained, the lighting inside the surroundings of the stadium should be on all the time especially around the vendors and stairs to the stadium entrance and the stairs to reach the seats down and up this is a basic need to see where we're going even if it's too the bathrooms especially when the lights of the concert goes out for 30 seconds to switch wardrobe or the bands take a break seriously that's a must not a question of if or when, the price's tlfor memorabilia is exorbitant to the point of price of a parking spot, beers and other drinks I can understand, after all this is a business...and you have to make a profit, the concert for as much I like Coldplay believe me is not a big as Metallica or Adelle or U2 sadly the experience left to much to desire I'm old school so I want to be entertained and happy walk out of there freaking happy and excited, not the opposite,  my expectations was to hear them playing there most iconic song the one's that made them famous from past and present, on a personal note the show was kind of ok-ishhh but some drunk caracters and some weed smoking millenials next to us that didn't even have tickets for their seats were just standing in the stairs and constantly being told to move but always came back, I might have said it was an average concert but the lights and Lazer show was OK show,  the exit from the venue it was horrible and for what is worth all of you need to seriously work on how to get people's vehicles out of there ASA freaking P we were there from 10 55 till midnight i mean i'm not crossing the border for Alcohol at least when I'm crossing to Mexico I know what to expect on my way back but getting out of a stadium is freaking ridiculous seriously you need to work on getting experience security or the local authorities to provide some level of support or the least some amount of knowledge on how to deal with traffic especially when dealing with 40 thousand people...Overall for me it was a bad experience,  getting in a problem, the venue not enough lighting,exorbitant price's, the concert good lighting show but poor in songs selection, too much talking not enough songs, I'm all for saving the world, but some singer need to sing and entertain me not bored me, and last but not least the exit to stadium a total drama and bad experience...in the future listen to feedback or ignore me and suffer for not being able to make a change on this information...thanks"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I have been to cold play before and this event was Lame. Starting with the volume of the concert, it was the most quiet concert I have ever been to. People were having conversations over the music. There was NO BASS whatsoever. Seems like either Snapdragon stadium has audio issues or the music engineers running the show dont have a clue. I want my money back."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Show was fantastic,  ist time at this venue getting to seats was tight and challenging but was worth it.  Sadly the parking management was terrible.  Took hour and a half to exit stadium!  Worst than when it was Qualcomm stadium with twice as many attendees... what the he'll are they thinking over there!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I was so surprised, when I walked in and heard HER!   I did not read that she was opening for Coldplay.  She was so good!  Then as we walked around the venue, some of my favorite eateries were there!  Crack Shack and Hodads!  I was bummed that I had eaten beforehand.  Coldplay started and they were terrific!  The drone light show wristbands were aesthetically pleasing and they sounded phenomenal.  Travel in and out of the stadium was a piece of cake!  I would definitely return to snapdragon again!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Magic moments, singing out loud, feeling rythm in the heart, tears in my eyes ‚Ä¶ I turned 50 this year and fulfilled my lifetime dream to see Coldplay. Coming 10k miles to San Diego ‚Ä¶ saw the Sky full of stars and I am alive again !!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"No doubt about it, this was the best concert I‚Äôve been too. Me and my fianc√©e are big Coldplay fans and have watched their concerts on TV or Youtube. Being able to experience one of their live concerts exceeded both our expectations. The music, the lights, the vibe, everything was more then we thought being there and present at the show. We‚Äôre very lucky they came to our city!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"We went to see Coldplay for the third time in two years at different locations.  They always put on the best show!  So much ""feel good""energy through out the entire evening.  We will be back to see them again!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Took my daughter to her first Coldplay concert and she was absolutely in love with the atmosphere at the snapdragon stadium! Thank you for this wonderful experience!
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"070, H.E.R. And Coldplay was Amazing!!! Coldplay rocked it! The love, the music and the light show were out of this world‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Left the concert with a restored faith in Humanity and the belief that anything is possible ."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"My wife and I saw Coldplay at Snapdragon, this being our third show and first for our three kids. Awesome experience from start to finish!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The best concert ever, felt wonderful for the whole family, sople of all ages were enjoying it and it was very uplifting! Not the crazy concert scene from lately."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"It was overall a great experience from start to finish. Breeze to get there with public trolley, I had parked my car earlier in the neighborhood, as I was horrified how traffic home was last time at their concert in 2017 at Qualcomm. From the last song to my home, all in 20 (!!!) minutes! I mean WOW! I had a seat in section 110 row 27 (great for quick and easy access in and out!). And I was able to see the entire lot up stadium - less of the fireworks, but that was ok with me. Friend of mine paid three times more for their tickets (section 104, row 4) which turned out to be the worst seats. They couldn‚Äôt see much and were disappointed by the price they paid and what they got in the end.  I suggest NOT to get any row below 15 on the main floor if you want to see anything."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,It was such an enjoyable concert. Very inclusive. It truly felt everyone was sharing a single happy experience in unison. I may have had too much alcohol as well.  But it was a great concert  I‚Äôll do it again!
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I will never forget how amazing the concert was, highly recommend that everyone should experience them live.  There were no flaws, perfect night."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Awesome night.  My girls said it was the best ever! Thank you for the giving them a great memory to share. I am an avid live music fan and the show rivaled with the best shows I have ever attended.  The guys connected with their music and made it personal!  Thank you!
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Great concert experience with the set, lights, fireworks but Chris Martin's voice sounded tired and fatigued.  The voice sounds like he is in pain when he sings.  I saw Coldplay ~11 years ago and his voice was great then and he sounded like his recordings.  Sometimes it's better to space out the concerts on tour to allow the performer to rest the voice instead of cramming in more shows for $.  I think they are a good group though - nice guys and socially responsible."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,When you enter they give you a wrist band that lights up with the concert! Then in your seats you get a great view of the artist. They play with such great energy and are amazing performers!
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay and HER exceeded all,expectations‚Ä¶..what a fabulous night of music.
The other two opening acts were painfully horrible‚Ä¶some rap bad and some very depressed angry woman. Don‚Äôt recall the names."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Hands down, best concert I have been to. Bucket list band I‚Äôve always wanted to see. I cried so many times it was just an unforgettable experience."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The pre-opening acts were ok, nothing spectacular, but once H.E.R. started the show, the energy if the place went straight up. She put out a really good show, and this is coming from not a big fan. Coldplay's performance was awesome, full of energy, great music, and fun interaction with the audience. Wristband lighshow was a great addition and fun way for the audience to participate in the show. Overall awesome experience and super fun time!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,This was amazing! And Snapdragon Stadium is going to be so successful with having concerts. Chris Martin and the band are outstanding and I can tell genuinely good men.
9/29/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay is a concert every human should experience! They are incredible and beyond talented. Their energy is electric and out of this world. I attend many many concerts and Coldplay is hands down the BEST concert ever! You can tell they love what they do and love their fans. I cannot wait to see them again one day!! Worth every penny!!
9/27/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The most colourful show I've ever been to.  I enjoyed the performance of HER, she has a beautiful voice. Everything from beginning to end was worth it"
9/27/23,BC Place - Vancouver,The show itself was top notch. Coldplay absolutely rocked it from start to finish. The BC Place concession was absalute garbage. Molsen Canadian cans (which had to be poured into pop cups afterwards) and Granville Island Beers are the worst selection you can ever have. Whitecaps games actually have great beer at the thirsty pigeon bars on tap. It was sad you had no options. Next time I‚Äôll be sneaking in my own liquor.
9/27/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"I knew very little about Coldplay and only knew a few songs I‚Äôd heard my ex play periodically.
Her and I bought tickets along time ago, and had since decided to just be friends. The day of the show she offered the tickets to me because she couldn‚Äôt find someone to go with her. I asked my new girlfriend and she said let‚Äôs go!
So we went, and I was amazed at the whole production.
Their songs were emotional to say the least. After it was over, we kinda hung around, not wanting to leave. 

I‚Äôve been to so many concerts I‚Äôve probably forgotten half of them, but I‚Äôll never forget Coldplay.
Thanks you guys for a job well done."
9/27/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The show was amazing, the sound was amazing wish the merch truck showed up cause majority of the items were sold out before the first opening act"
9/27/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Absolutely love Coldplay's concert, so much surprises throughout the event. Coldplay can always brings us happiness and touching music, never disappointed. You can always expect more from them, and there's always things that you cannot imagine how beautiful it will be.
Love the sound and light effects, bravo to the staffs and coordinators who made this event possible. The LED wristband really was a plus to the concert, everything became so glamorous through the lighting. And they also giveaway pins as souvenir.
Will always try to go to their concert!"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,One of the best performances I have ever seen from floor ! The light show and stars and butterflies falling from the stadium roof put the whole crowd into an emotional nostalgia.  I will never forget this experience !!!
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay sounded amazing and the wristbands that lit up were fun and brought a lot of added energy to an already great concert!
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The most amazing show I've ever seen, I recommend a Coldplay concert to everyone, whatever age you are. It's an amazing show!"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Simply put I was blown away. 

2 excellent opening acts with H.E.R. and 070 Shake.  H.E.R. had amazing range and dynamism, while 070 shake was a distinctive stoned-trippy vibe whose music sticks with me multiple days after the concert.

Coldplay was beyond wonder though, with each and every song being amazing, having impactful moments connecting with the audience, having us put our phones away. The colours and the lights were without question the coolest part and having that on your wristband helped you feel truly involved. I had an unbelievable experience and I am oh so grateful for being there."
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Coldplay concert was an unforgettable experience that left me with a mix of emotions. But first, let's talk about the warm-up act.

üåü **H.E.R.'s Warm-Up:**I couldn't help but wonder if she was the best choice for this particular audience. Like many others, I had never heard of her before this concert. Her frequent deviations from the music to address the audience, while well-intentioned, felt a bit disconnected from the flow of the show.

üöÄ **Coldplay's Brilliance:** Now, on to the main event‚ÄîColdplay. Their performance was nothing short of outstanding. The band's commitment to making the world a better place through their donations and environmental efforts is truly inspiring. Their music, combined with their message, created a unique and powerful atmosphere.

üí´ **LED Bracelets:** The LED bracelets provided to the audience were a stroke of genius. They made me feel like an integral part of the show, connecting with thousands of others in a breathtaking display of unity. I can honestly say I've never felt happier during a concert. It was an experience that radiated positivity and togetherness.

üôè **A Note of Respect:** However, there was a bittersweet note to the night. Some concertgoers decided to take these beautiful bracelets home as souvenirs. I would like to appeal to everyone attending future Coldplay concerts: please don't do that. These bracelets are part of the show's magic, and by taking them, we're not only disrespecting the band but also the hardworking team behind the scenes. Let's cherish the positive energy they bring and leave with memories, not mementos."
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,The most magical concert I‚Äôve ever been to! (I‚Äôve been to over 30). Also very inclusive and sustainable! First concert I‚Äôve seen that has done a land acknowledgment in BC.
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Best concert!!! I have been to a lot of concerts and this one has been my best experience. I will recommend it to everyone! Love it!!
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,What a fantastic show put on by Coldplay.   From the fan engagement to the extras like flashing wristbands and bouncy balls.   I have never been to a show so great!   I literally was overwhelmed.   Thank you Coldplay for stopping here!!
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"It‚Äôs been my 2nd time attending their concert and they never fail to deliver. Everything is well thought of (lights, songs, choreo). It feels like you‚Äôre in another universe. It was my first time seeing them up close from the dance floor and it was epic!"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay really knew how to put on a show I‚Äôve never seen so much confetti and fun special extras in one show . It really was an unforgettable experience to be there and to experience all the songs we grew up on live.
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Quite simply the best concert I‚Äôve ever seen. Coldplay takes things to a whole new level, so naturally engaging with the public throughout; this truly was an opportunity to party with your favourite band."
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,We have had a great time. Unforgettable experience.  Coldplay is spectacular and have amazing performance. Worth spending. Kudos to the team.
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Ticket master made the event easy to access and enjoyable. Chris Martin and the band were amazing, best concert ever!"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"If you EVER get the chance, don‚Äôt hesitate, buy the ticket and go!  

Master of their music, their message and their connection to their audience. 

I was on my feet from the first note and until the lights came up. A moving and soul refilling experience with 50000 of my new friends.  

A must see for everyone and a must see again if you already have ‚Ä¶"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Everything was so easy and smooth, from the merchandise purchase to checking in with my tickets in my phone wallet to getting to my seat! 
HER was amazing but Coldplay‚Ä¶. They were amazing! The sound was even better than the last time!"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was hands down the best concert I have ever been to. It's such an interactive experience - the light up bracelets (which are recyclable), the balloons, the streamers/confetti. I had the time of my life!"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was the most amazing show! Coldplay never disappoints! Chris Martin pulls the audience in and doesn‚Äôt let go, somehow making 50,000 people feel like they are at an intimate show, the band is rock solid in their performance. I was transcended to another place in time and place. Adventure of a Lifetime!"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Stage presence from Coldplay was best I have ever seen in a long time in a concert. Great idea for the wrist bands changing colors!
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay are true musicians and Chris Martin has endless energy. The wristbands add an extra element of fun alongside the music. Highly recommend this concert!
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"We had the best experience ever. A 2 hrs singalong , unforgettable moments. We are lucky enough to be able to see them twince, and looking forward for next one. We have traveled from Toronto to Vancouver to see them, and once again, Coldplay created an amazing,  out of this world , magical night. Thank you Coldplay, see you next time."
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,The energy and way that Chris connects with his audience was amazing!  I‚Äôd fly to another city again to see him perform! I also heard every top song he‚Äôs released. üôåüôå
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a fabulous concert! Chris Martin made parts feel like an intimate performance, working the crowd like no other. Amazing light show & brilliant performance all the way around. A special surprise to see Bryan Adams perform!"
9/26/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The event starts really early and stretches it out to the point of breaking before Coldplay arrive. The weak support acts inna rap group, 070 skate (or shake? Basically some girl drugged out of her mind,l and HER do well to establish the VAST chasm between opening acts and the massive superstars Coldplay have become.

As someone who has followed the band avidly since the release of X&Y, this was a bucket list item that just had to happen. Flew from Pakistan to Toronto, then from Toronto to Vancouver just for this event. The set list comprised of the classics as well as some fan-service songs and some of the newer works, which definitely take some time to get used to. Watching your favourite bad parade around in alien Masks and singing to an odd dll isn't easy on the eye, and the songs that accompanied them were bang average.

But I came for the classics and that I got. Paradise, The Scientist, Yellow, Clocks, A Sky Full of Stars, and of course, Fix You. From playing the matter and the first one in my room to seeing the band perform them on stage was a dream come true. Chris's energy is infectious and it did the impossible - pulled the crowd back from the brink after those infuriatingly mediocre opening acts. The wait was longer than normal too. I got there at 3pm to get floor views at rhe very front, so my feet were dead by the end.

I wish there were some of the songs from the albums in the middle, such as X&Y, but they weren't understandably skipped for the newer material, since that's what the band will automatically promote. The original alt rock sound has changed a lot in recent works, but somehow the spirit of the band remains intact. While AHFOD and MOTS aren't albums I'd re-listen to, the older stuff is always something that pulls me back, and I'll definitely attend a concert again whenever I get the chance."
9/26/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The openers were amazing, the set up as well was super good, i was high up but still had an asking view from my seats, i felt safe and comfortable around everyone, it was semi easy to find bathrooms and food. during the concert was so amazing, the energy was amazing. the sound and lights were awesome."
9/26/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Surprised my two young children with tickets to this concert. Coldplay has always been one of my favorite bands and is subsequently theirs too. We were all blown away! Just a magical, positive energy, good vibes evening, with a great cause and message. Coldplay has their hearts and message in the right place and are advocating for our planet and positive change. Purely inspirational and I don‚Äôt think I can ever miss a Coldplay concert again. All the love! ü´∂üåé‚ù§Ô∏è"
9/26/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"I love COLDPLAY, this concert was amazing, the magic was in the air. I admire all their efforts to include all the community and promote/create sustainability for our planet through different programs and in their concerts."
9/26/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay puts on an amazing show! They have so much energy and they keep the crowd very engaged.  They're we're lots of surprises along the way,  great music and all around great fun!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"No words can explain. This was not just a concert, it was a magical, spiritual and emotional experience! So grateful to have had this opportunity."
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay always puts on the best show with amazing guests. If you have never been - it‚Äôs a must see. We will not miss another concert of theirs!
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"If you never go to another concert in your life, life isn‚Äôt complete without a Coldplay concert.  Such a socially conscious group, vibrant, pulsating show with lights and fire and confetti, showing off their incredibly talented music and skills.  Truly memorable!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great show. Sound system was good, crowd control professional and lighting wrist watches was brilliant. Show finished on time before the trains stopped. The staff all over the venue were welcoming."
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,I saw them 20 years ago in London when they had been together a few years and I have wanted to see them since. Coldplay didn‚Äôt disappoint! I was lucky to attend both nights and I will say that not only did I dance my butt off but i also found myself crying while listening to some of my favourite songs! From the first moment (well done on the land acknowledgment) to the very end - you left all us all feeling like we had just experienced a show that could be summarized in no other word than MAGIC! Thank you for putting on one hell of a show!
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Absolutely amazing.  It could have all been recorded music and the production would still be worth it.  Amazing to see how they are trying to decrease their carbon footprint and giving back to environmental causes as well.  I was so sad when it was all over.
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a great show with positive vibes. It was unfortunate that they did not have enough merchandise in varying sizes, and the merchandise was a small fit. There weren‚Äôt enough pins or light up bracelets for everybody who was in attendance, which was also a shame. The music was fantastic. Coldplay are great performers and it was a great night!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was so worth it. The stage setup and lights were spectacular!! A little sad they ran out of wristbands so we didn‚Äôt get one, but being there and able to see the show made up for it. Chris was so energetic and engaging. The band was amazing. Would definitely buy tickets to see them again whenever they come back."
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,It was a great concert for the entire family! It was truly a spectacle for the eyes as well as the ears! H.E.R. was a great second opener. The first opener ( don't recall her name )  not so much. She appeared to be drunk or stoned and her music was not good. Add her potty mouth to the mix and I'm not quite sure how anyone thought this was a good fit with Coldplay. It was also a treat to have Bryan Adams make a surprise visit to the stage. Coldplay was amazing.
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,This concert was by far the best one i‚Äôve ever been to. From the opening message to the opening acts to of course Coldplay themselves. It was unbelievable. The bracelets really made it a crowd experience and it made the whole concert feel so special. 10/10 I will be going again!!!
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Fireworks would've been the icing on the cake but it was unfortunate Vancouver didn't get any. Other than that, hands down Coldplay was the best concert I've been to!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Best most immersive concert i've attended at BC place. Coldplay cares so much about making a difference in our world and even their concert reflected that. Fantastic experience
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"We have such a nice time watching them last Saturday at BC place. A very talented, warm hearted performer. I love when he invited a kid to get in the stage to make a song for the lil kid‚Äôs birthday. No one compares to this band. Wish for more concerts from them."
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a wonderful experience the best I have received there so far and I have Ben to a lot of shows there!

Helpful staff outside the venue ready to help (for me was my bag size).

No line ups to get in, no line ups for food and beverages..

The only line up was the Ladies bathroom (normal) lol..

Overall had a fantastic evening!

Side note - Coldplay was phenomenal!

I was so happy it hurt to see Bryan Adams show up as well, what a dream of an evening!

Thank you, thank you, thank you to you all!!!!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"We absolutely loved the show, high quality performances, they delivered positive energy to L of us and love to our earth! We love cold play! It has always been my dream to be at their concert!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was all that was promised and a bonus with Brian Adams participating with cold play.   I enjoyed the connection of the concert in general by bring everyone together and speaking directly to the audience with powerful music.
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Just absolutely amazing. 
Audience involvement, amazing bracelet light-show, surprise guest, commitment to sustainability and the environment.

Coldplay absolutely killed it! Already looking forward to their next show."
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay was so awesome! Took both my daughters to their first concert and they had a blast! The only thing that was a little disappointing is there were no fireworks allowed due to the fire ban. Having fireworks would've brought the show to a hole new level but even without them it was amazing!!! We would see them again for sure!!
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Wow Coldplay is always an amazing time. Seen them twice now and they consistently have this magical way of making you feel so positive about yourself and everyone around you. I swear I left that concert with love for all 50,000 audience members that experienced it with me. They stay humble and use their money to make positive change so it makes you feel good supporting them. A role model for all popular acts: get on the level!!!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great performance; Coldplay really control the stage, and everyone was so high and engaged. Moreover, love how they promote sustainability and make it fun; even did a land acknowledgment, that‚Äôs really good"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was, hands down, the very best concert I've ever been to (and I've been fortunate to have been to many). Coldplay puts on an amazing show and there is always such joy and positivity in the crowd (which plays off the joy of the band). Fantastic sound and amazing performance!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Just their demeanour, their positive outlook and how they conveyed it and the fun spirit they brought to their performance was just some of the things that made this best concert I've ever been to. I was able to share this experience with my 16-year-old son and we just had the best time. The LED bracelets were so awesome, loved that they all turned yellow when they were about to sing Yellow."
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Oh my god I can‚Äôt even put it into words how amazing this concert was! Coldplay is such a wholesome group, you can clearly see how they care about their fans. They were the first ever concert to acknowledge the First Peoples and Traditional Territories and bring a few of them of stage before the concert startedüß° We got an amazing surprise with Bryan Adams coming on stage for a song and two great pre show performances by H.E.R. and 070 Shake. I have never had so much fun at a concert before I never wanted the night to end! Such an amazing environment was created for this beautiful concert‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you Coldplay for putting on the best night ever!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"Paid for the ticket, but didn‚Äôt receive light watch. Go to guest services and tells us people have taken 2 watches per person."
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The bracelets they gave out at the beginning of the show, I thought were going to be a keepsake, but when they started going off, it really made you feel like you were part of the show, rather than just watching it. I really had a great time and would say if you haven't been to a Coldplay concert, add it to your bucket it list!!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,So I flew from Montr√©al QC to see Coldplay at BC Place and WOW!! Nice stadium and my seat was perfectly placed. The only drawback was not having the fireworks! Hope I won‚Äôt need to wait another 6 years to see them again‚Ä¶ in Canada or closer to my hometown!!
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,I was in section 209 and the view was amazing. When Bryan Adams came on I could see him amazing and I could see the stage really well. The bracelets made the show shine and the lights were amazing. Her did very well and overall it was my favourite concert I have been to. 10/10 recommend
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"H.E.R exceeded expectations. Her musical talents floored me and surprise me at the same time. I would go and see her anytime to hear her sing and play.
Coldplay was just so much fun and entertaining. It was more than just a concert. It was an interactive experience."
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,The best concert experience ever! Amazing! Chris Martin and Coldplay delivered on every aspect. Could not have been better!
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,The most interactive concert I have ever been to. Seriously a concert everyone needs to attend in their lifetime. 100000000/10
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,I‚Äôve dreamed of going to a Coldplay concert my entire life and this completely surpassed my expectations! It was absolutely magical and an experience I will never forget.
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,Title says it all.  They are the best live band ever.  Even if they couldn't do all their pyro in Vancouver.  Second time seeing them on this tour and can't wait to see them again!
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"If you‚Äôre on the fence about going to a Coldplay concert, get off of it and buy the tickets now. The band does not disappoint and must be seen!"
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"One of the best concert ive ever seen!
Electric performance. Coldplay did not disappoint. I wish they could have played longer. The only downside is the absence of fireworks,but its understandable."
9/25/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"A lot of dancing, singing and goosebumps!!! It was soooo good!!! The concert was so organized! Just one comment from a near-sighted person like me, i hope that the VIP seats were placed by the stage where we can see Coldplay upclose and not the general admission. We paid so much just to watch on the monitor ü•∫ but aside from that everything was perfect!!‚ù§Ô∏è"
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Loved the venue! Lumen Field had great sound and audible clarity. Seattle is a great destination for fun, good sites and food. Outstanding service everywhere we went. 
Coldplay gave us fans a fabulous night of music, visual displays and genuine connections to the crowd. An organization that is doing good things and sharing the love as they reach the world."
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,We have a wonderful time .I was depressed when I went because I just lost my husband but when the show started it lifted my spirit. I‚Äôd been going to Coldplay concert then I invited my friend to go with me so now we are both obsessed with Coldplay thanks again fir the wonderful night . Thanks to my friend Anna fir going with me. Hope will see them again
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,It was once in a lifetime experience. Have waited for this concert for a long time and still it exceeded my expectations. Love Chris Martin and Coldplay
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,An incredible experience! We saw them at Climate Pledge and it was much more impressive at Lumen field. They always put on a great show - well worth seeing if given the chance.
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay and all in attendance put on a show I won't soon forget.  The interactive event was unique and full of value.  They focus on sustainable practice and making the small changes with big impact.  Value written all over this event.  My only complaint is that I waited so long to dive in the deep end!  Thank you, thank you and thank you again.  I was on my way home from 3 difficult, rewarding days in DC volunteering for ACS CAN and singing and dancing with thousands of people with positive energy was the welcome home of my dreams!"
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Wow! What an amazing experience! From the sound, to the lighted wrist bands, to the fireworks, the band itself... just an amazing time. The BEST live show I have ever witnessed. So worth the travel and time spent."
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,One of the best concerts I have been into. The message that they deliver is amazing and the vibes are unbelievable. Loved the concert and the ambiance!
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"What an incredible experience. It's not just a concert it's a show. I took my son and told him, balls were never allowed back in my day and when Coldplay released all the balls for the crowd, it was amazing. You wear bracelets that light up in sequence throughout the show. It was a very long show and we loved it. The opening acts, especially the second one was not good at all. Coldplay are amazing people that care for many things and their fans. Would 100% go again! Oh, the fireworks were over the top and made it magical!"
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Tickets are so expensive nowadays to not consider giving everyone the best view possible. You can tell they tried, but most of the time Chris and the band were far away and/or blocked out of view for fans in the lower bowl due to some structures and towers being out-of-position.
I still remember the U2 concert at Qwest Field (as it was known then) more than a decade ago, where the stage was in the middle of the pitch. That stage was especial, and it offered a much better experience for everyone. Probably one of the greatest concerts in the stadium too."
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I absolutely loved every second of it! They had great openers to start with! They had a truly magical experience! The show was so inclusive and welcoming and so so special! I am really honored to have seen the show with my family and friends! I loved that the show was using green energy and that you could partake in making energy for the stages to light up!
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Better (last time they were in Lumen Field) and best show. The energy generated by Chris, the band and their songs was incredible. Love the huge round screens, the fun colorful balloons, the amazing light show. Love the part when Chris invited three young guys who travelled more than 13,000 miles from Indonesia joining him on stage."
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I could write a whole letter about coldplay! I‚Äôm a big fan since I was 11 years old .. so  after this 23 years been in 5 of this MOTS tour it‚Äôs been super cool their shows bring magic to the stadium and healing music to the soul ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
9/25/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay didn't disappoint and thankfully so since I traveled to the concert from Wisconsin! They are insanely talented, know how to get a crowd engaged, and make you feel like they are singing to you. I love that they are socially conscious and bring that to their venues."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This was one of the best concert performances I've seen in a while.  So fantastic what Coldplay is doing for the environment
]"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Just. Amazing, my only concern is that I'm no sure of I will enjoy another concert as much as I enjoyed this one Coldplay is in a different category"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It's Coldplay, that sums it up.  If you've seen them live, you'll know what I mean.  They are out of this world live.  I have been a fan for 20+ years and they are still at the top of my list of favorites.  The music, the lights, the confetti, the pyro (if your lucky enough to get pyro at your show), the different stages - it's just second to none.  The floor experience is not to be missed.  It is an immersive experience and should be on your bucket list.  After every concert - I eagerly await the next time they tour."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Amazing concert! They played all their classics. We took our daughters for their first concert and it couldn‚Äôt have been a better concert to attend!
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,This was the most amazing performance I have ever seen. With all the lights and the fireworks and the amazing community of the concert. I went there with my mother and this is definitely going to be a core memory for me. We got all dressed up and had an amazing time.
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"We were in the upper level to the right of the stage and must have been right where multiple speaker sound waves collided. It overpowered our ears and we heard mostly background music when the group was all performing together, no vocals. When Chris was mostly singing by himself, the vocals were, of course, great. Overall, we really enjoyed the experience. We were very disappointed in the audio though. We‚Äôll sit in a different section for sure next time."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Nothing beats the show that Coldplay puts on. Fireworks, Xlobands, awesome music and you leave with a restored faith in humanity!  Everyone should see them at least once"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Just an emotional rollercoaster, given how legendary their songs are. Moved to tears twice. Brought along my parents and they loved it."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"They played their most excellent music, the band kept the crowd involved the lights were fantastic the giant balloons and fireworks!!! I recommend staying to the end it was sooo worth it!! They just kept singing more great songs!!  The crowd is not at all bad and I felt completely safe walking solo back to my car a mile away.  Do not agree ahead to park at Hilton just park there and walk. I double paid such a joke paying ahead for parking there."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The concert was an experience that exceeded all my long-waited expectations. It‚Äôs been a bucket list item of mine forever and ‚Ä¶ I GOT ENGAGED DURING ‚ÄúMY UNIVERSE!‚Äù 
It‚Äôs our phrase since before the song came out, so when the song debuted, we knew it was ‚Äúour song‚Äù. He proposed in the most beautiful way possible, surrounded by strangers that became friends instantly when they cheered for us and with us. 
It was an unforgettable night and I‚Äôll be forever grateful!!!"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Two opening acts to warm up the crowd. I wasn't familiar with 070 Shake, but they were interesting, and I liked it. Then Her took the stage and she didn't need the sparkling tracksuit to shine on stage. 
I had seen the Coldplay Music From the Spheres concert in the theaters when Jin played with them in Argentina. So I kind of knew what to expect. But in person, the energy and love came across 100-fold more. They played their hits and new songs. There were giant balloons that represented planets that were being tossed around by the crowd. The supplied light bands were so much fun and joined the crowd together. Everyone was standing throughout the performance, and several songs had us dancing and jumping around.  And for BTS ARMY, Wooteo is still on stage with the band. It is an experience!"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The best concert ever with so much positive and high energy.
They gave their best show with having the audiences participating on it
I can't wait to see them at their next show"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"I went with my daughter for her first concert. Coldplay is my fave all time! She was hesitant but she lit up and now keeps thanking me for the beast experience!!
Hands down Magical!"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay was AMAZING! INCREDIBLE! I enjoyed every bit of their performance. I loved how Chris Martin engaged with the audience. He is a great showman! The special effects such as confetti, bouncing planets, colorful lights and wristbands made it memorable and one of a kind. I would go see them again ! The Lumen Field was clean, comfortable and made my experience enjoyable and one of a kind too. I will never forget my first Coldplay and stadium concert !"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I bought floor tickets for the first time. I‚Äôm not sure if I will buy them again. It was so chaotic. It was an experience for sure. Coldplay always puts on a good show. For the opening act 070 or whatever the name was. She does not belong with this crowd. I felt very confused and concerned for the artist. I love to see artist that are young and talented but‚Ä¶.. That aside there really should be more alcohol enforcement. I will always support artist so I will go to another concert. Just hoping not to smell a porta potty the whole concert and have intoxicated people falling over and knocking me over.
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Incredible show of music and lights. Extatic atmosphere in the stadium. We had a blast, although the sound was pretty bad at the beginning but got better later."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Awesome music with amazing energy. The floor experience was just so immersive; felt like Chris Martin was singing with you with everyone chanting and dancing all around you. Loved the wrist bands lighting up the whole stadium with the music!
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The absolute best, most amazing, beyond magical show I have ever experienced. My heart actually hurts now that it's over."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"We last saw Coldplay 15 years ago in Winnipeg in an area and it was memorable.  The venue was much smaller, but the energy was incredible ... fast forward to 2023 and here we are with 58,000 people who were all in tune with one another and in awe of the perfectly choreographed spectacle that the guys were starting to develop way back in 2009.    I loved every second of it.    I had my wife and two daughters with me and we all knew what to expect ... but it ended up being so much more.  Thank you Coldplay for the lifelong memory. God put a smile on our faces, and every tear drop was a waterfall."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"After a long wait, a concert that didn‚Äôt happen, Covid on my end. Soul crushing. Thinking I would not get to see Coldplay ever. Then extended tour dates and it finally happened!  The experience was everything I hoped for and knew it would be - absolutely positively, amazing! My only disappointment was that it had to end!"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This was my 3rd time seeing Coldplay and they never disappoint! Aside from being amazing musicians, the visuals, the confetti, the pyrotechnics, the bracelets each guest wears that lights up in sync with the music, the giant balloons/bouncy balls- and their messages/passion for being kind to all. 

Each time I‚Äôve sent them, I‚Äôve been moved to tears at some point during their shows! I would see them 100x Such a FUN, engaging, happy, special show! 

If you EVER have the opportunity to see them live, do it! You won‚Äôt regret it! This time I took my kids who are now teens, which has been a dream of mine, and they loved every minute!"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Out of all the western acts/concerts I've been to, no one can top the energy and awesomeness of their concert! They're next to my BTS group."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Coldplay was amazing, and always has been. But I‚Äôve been to many concerts at Lumen Field with no issue. This one was def off. It started with the first performer, when you could not hear any word they were saying because their mic was too high. When Coldplay showed up it was a little better but not great. And I‚Äôve seen them multiple times where their sound was perfect! They were either too loud or too quiet. 
But like I said, it had nothing to do with them. They were still great, and I would still do it again. I had fun with my friends, and that was the important part. 
It‚Äôs always fun when they interact with the crowd. Everyone always enjoys that."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay‚Ä¶need I say more. Their music, their charisma..just everything.  I love that they carry Wooteo around with them as a reminder of Jin and BTS as their musical siblings."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It was the best concert i have ever been to! And it will probably be difficult to top this off. I just wished Lumen Field had more Marshalls or staff to point people to their seats. A lot of people got confused looking for the correct seats. Some seats are labelled, in example, Block 307 Row II or Row HH, which is super confusing especially to those who have not been to the stadium before. Otherwise, THE.BEST.CONCERT.EVER!!"
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,This is the second time I have seen them live. Ever since I saw them first perform I have compared every concert to Coldplay. They put on an amazing show that honestly can‚Äôt be matched by anyone else. They are true artists and performers. I will see them any chance I get for as long as they tour.
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Great concert in all ways! Excellent music, great crowd, amazing audience participation and easy in & out access, all in a beautiful fresh air stadium."
9/24/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Elegance in sprezzatura! Coldplay has achieved all the seasoned polish and command of Industry statesmen; delivering masterful art with intellect, vision and intuition. The ability to bring 58,000 strangers into unity and cohesion speaks to the heart of their purpose. From row one to rafters we felt our belonging. Kinetics. Bracelets. Music. Life!!
Absolutely exhilarating and meaningful.‚ù§Ô∏è"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The production was incredible, the experience was once in a lifetime, the band did not disappoint in the slightest‚Ä¶ it was everything you could ask for in a concert."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"I‚Äôve never in a concert like this, it was amazing from beginning to end! Thanks for coming to Seattle. Love you Coldplay always!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay was hands down the best concert experience that I‚Äôve ever had. The band was charismatic and energetic with (obviously) outstanding vocals. The light up bracelets were a magical touch to the show and the crowd was up on their feet and dancing even way up in the nosebleeds. I highly recommend that everyone go to see Coldplay live at least once in their lives.
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,It was a blast of concert. And also H.E.R she was totally amazing singer. That was actually for my daughter‚Äôs gift birthday wish to see her favorite band. Chris Martin was totally excellent performer.
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The best concert I‚Äôve ever been to. Incredible band. (Coldplay) the light up bracelets, the fireworks, Chris Martin is an incredible entertainer! Core memory for sure!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay was absolutely amazing. There's nothing like being at one of their concerts. It's like attending a huge music festival all in one night. Once in a lifetime type experience - absolutely AMAZING üòç‚ú®üí´
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Absolutely THE BEST CONCERT EVER!! My 10 year old daughter and I danced for 2 hours, shared laughter and tears and are still daydreaming about this EPIC nightü•≥ ‚ÄúDaughter said: We are not Swifties, mom, We are ColdiesüòÇüòÇ‚Äùüôå Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the most incredible night!!! We are fans for life for sure! Have seen Coldplay in many cities across US and it has always been a life changing experience. Now my daughter is growing up loving them as much! What they do for humanity, our planet and the way they inspire new generation is absolutely incredible and I just feel so blessed to live in the same lifetime as them‚ù§Ô∏è God bless you guys and may you continue shining forever and bringing light and love to the WORLD‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It was one of the best concerts ever, I want them to have another trip in America, I 1000000% recommended going to their concert it was soooo good!! I love it!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay is that group everyone should see. Your ticket is admission to the show. It also comes with a  love button, a recyclable light wrist band and encouraged audience participation.  It‚Äôs the band that finishes out the night and you can smile and be ok with it being over. It‚Äôs the band you take home on the bus humming all the way. It‚Äôs the band that you fall asleep to in your head and wake up still humming.   Never miss Coldplay when they are in your town."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The performance was amazing! The lighting, the sound quality, the visuals, the personality of the band, and obviously, the music! I loved how many jokes were made during the performance, too!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I had so much fun. The staff were friendly and managed the crowd quite well even though everybody was excited. The audio sounded good after the arena filled up and the lights were cool!!
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It started with the really friendly and welcoming staff at the gates and just got better from there. Lumen Field is clean and bright and easy to navigate. We missed a couple of the early acts, but H.E.R. was good. And then there was Coldplay. Perfect in every way."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Both H.E.R. and Coldplay exceeded expectations. Coldplay‚Äôs live show in a venue that size is absolutely experiential and magical.  The kind of experience you don‚Äôt want to end.  Worth every penny!
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"My third time seeing Coldplay and won't be my last. Felt like an intimate time with 58000 of my closest friends. 
The only fly in the ointment was all the unannounced street closures making it very difficult to find parking...$80.00 parking."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,The Coldplay concert was the best concert that I‚Äôve been to in awhile. The crowd was so energized and everyone was singing. Lumen Field is a great venue. The lights on our wrists just made the evening more special.
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Rarely do I leave reviews here, if ever, but this show was outright euphoric.  Easily a group of performers that I would see again!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"I was preparing to catch a plane the day of the concert with my granddaughter and the flight was cancelled, talk about a let down for both of us. I come home and ordered tickets for the Sandiego show. We are so excited and hope nothing gets in the way this time ."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Great concert.  Amazing production: lights, stage, fireworks, planets, light-up wrist bands, etc.....  Chris Martin was in great form. He's an amazing front-man.  Highly recommend you seeing them on this tour!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Best concert I‚Äôve ever been to and I am a concert junkie. It was what I would imagine seeing the beetles or Elvis would have been like back in the day. It has always been a bucket list for me and truly moved me to tears! So much emotion and energy. The flashing bands were a blast too!!!!
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Cold Play was the most energized and fun concert I‚Äôve been to in ages! The light up bracelets are such a fun addition to their concert!

Definitely don‚Äôt go if you have seizures that are triggered by flashing lights‚Ä¶.

The first two opening acts were not enjoyable. The lady who came on right before Cold Play was super talented and I enjoyed her.

Wish Cold Play had stayed on longer. We flew across the country to go see them. Would definitely go see them again!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The way that Chris Martin connected with such a huge audience was astonishing! The overall show was incredible, S.H.E was fantastic and Coldplay blew all of my expectations out of the water! Experience of a lifetime!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This was hands down THE BEST concert I've ever been to! The venue, the setup, the security, the merch tables... all were efficient and got everyone through in a timely manner. Coldplay ROCKED of course!! But I have to also say how incredibly impressed I was with their green energy setup! They are setting a new, eco-friendly standard for concert touring and concert attending! With recycled oil to power generators, plant based 'plastic', storing kinetic energy from fans, using ticket profits to support eco-charities, just to name a few! Well done Coldplay!!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This was my 9th time seeing Coldplay perform and as always, they put on a spectacular performance and show!! If you ever get the chance to see them, do it!! You‚Äôll have an amazing time!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,The performance was highly energetic and they visual ecstasy. It‚Äôs fun to go to a concert where the spectators are part of the show.
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Amazing concert! Traveled many, MANY miles to see Coldplay and would do it again and again. Lumen Field was also a great venue to experience them. 15/10 recommend ‚ô•Ô∏è"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay was amazing, as usual. A visual spectacle, super high-energy, and of course the best mix of classics, favorites, and new hits. It‚Äôs impossible not to feel good after a show like this!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Out of all the concerts I‚Äôve been to, Coldplay will always be one of the best live shows I‚Äôve experienced. Amazing performance!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay always puts on a great show! I always felt like they gave A LOT back to the fans, compare to most arties, they always pull out all the stop and give us a great show, and Chris seem to be such a great person and genuinely care bout their fans, if you want just ONE unforgettable experience in your life time, than go to a Coldplay concert, you don't even need to ever heard any of their music, just go!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Possibly one of the best shows I have attended!!!!!!!!!! and many thanks to Ticketmaster to providing a easy and convenient way to allow me to see them live.
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Our experience at this last concert was absolutely incredible. It was my 12 and 14 y/o‚Äôs first Coldplay concert and they LOVED it! The whole show is so full of energy! The light up bracelets really bring everyone together, and no matter where you are sitting, you are part of it all. 

We will definitely go again whenever they come to our hometown! Thank you to the whole band for touring all these years. I hope you keep it going, we LOVE YOU!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Chris Martin did not disappoint! Not only was the light show, fireworks, and props exceptional, but my favorite part was his challenge to turn off phones and just be and experience the moment together! It will be unforgetable!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"I have been to hundreds of concerts and this one was by far the best I've ever seen. It was fun and energetic. I laughed, I cried and I danced. Absolutely incredible experience"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Best Performance ever!!! Chris Martin put on the best show of his life. The energy was electric and Amazing! Great Concert!!!
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,A Coldplay concert is something that everyone should experience at least once in their lives. Even if you don‚Äôt know many or any songs at all. It was a wonderful experience
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Our seats were high up. And so I expect to not see much. But we couldn‚Äôt see the screens either. 
Not much of a show for us. I could have stayed home and listened to their album."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Confetti, oversized balloons to replicate planets, LED wrist bands (from recycled plastic), crowd singalong, unstoppable Chris energy, humble entertainers, topped of my an amazing fireworks finale (thank you open air Lumen Field) could not have been any better. Class all the way!!!!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,The lights were amazing and I loved when Coldplay invited those people on the stage. Loved all the jokes and how chill it was. Would definitely go again but next time on the floor for more dancing and jumping!
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"From my gym workout in Rockhampton, Australia in 2,000 where they kept their first hit Yellow on a loop, I hated that signature guitar strum‚Ä¶ Any song overplayed on a loop will drive one nuts with saturation. But the group followed up with Cold Rush of Blood to the Head, that‚Äôs when I learned what Coldplay was, a group with their frontman Chris Martin capable of finding the anthemic pulse their audience responds to‚Ä¶ fast forward a full generation from Clocks to several albums later, seemingly at The Speed of Sound and you get a repertoire that created The Spheres Tour with a Wristband light show lighting up the entire Lumen Field (genius). And shrinking Lumen Field into an intimate experience with three stages where Chris Martin could jog and skip from stage to stage making every seat in this large football venue into a personal inclusive experience. 

The best produced concert I have ever witnessed and I grew up in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, two of the signature decades for live music in the US of A."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I really enjoyed this concert but wish it was a little longer. Also there are some songs you shouldn‚Äôt mess with but Fix You was off key and cut short.
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Loved the eco-conscious power supply with the kinetic dance floors and bikes! The show was truly remarkable to watch and be apart of! Every song is a smash hit and the celestial/planetary vibes were a real treat!
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Best concert of my life, Coldplay never misses! Lumen field is an incredible venue and the concert will live in my memory forever!"
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay is honestly hands down the best concert of my life. I do wish the event staff handled the entry for GA better because those of us that waited 5 hours in line ended up going in at the same time as those that got there when the gates opened. The show itself was amazing though!
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,This was easily the best concert I‚Äôve ever been to. The production was amazing and everything was so well put together. I loved all the fireworks and being about to experience this with my best friend was amazing.
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Voldplay shows are just AMAZING. It's impossible not to have a good time once the show starts. It truly is incredible what a sbow they pull off
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"To see Coldplay in concert is such a thrilling experience.  They sound amazing, and it's so visually stunning.  Hope we get the chance to see them again."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,One of the best shows I've ever seen. And I've have been to over 450 concerts. Coldplay was incredible with great appreciate for everyone involved. Would recommend them to anyone & everyone who wants to see one of the best concert in the world!!!
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"(Again Coldplay is incredible live so this review is for Lumen and for infinity tickets)

I got infinity tickets which I will never do again. Yes I realize they were cheap but also if they would have said we‚Äôd be behind the stage and obstructed, there is no way I‚Äôd have bought them. It made a horrible experience. 
Also the top level is so echo-y at lumen field that these should not be sold for concerts. I was so disappointed and have lost a ton of trust."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,One of my top 5 concerts. Absolutely amazing show from start to finish. This was my first time seeing them live and I was not disappointed.  Flew from Atlanta to Seattle just to see them. Worth every dollar spent! Would see them again!
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay was my first concert. I've been chasing the euphoria I felt since and the only thing that has been able to beat it has been Coldplay themselves. I was able to get Infinity tickets and experience an Adventure of a Lifetime.
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Loved Coldplay, loved the concert - would have loved the floor to not be GA but seating that could be purchased."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This concert was no just a concert it was an experience! The vibe all night was so positive and full of love.  I so blessed to be part of it, because words can‚Äôt describe the show."
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,This was a first concert my wife has ever attended and it is her favorite group. We were on the floor near the stage and the energy of the band and crowd really made it a memorable experience for both of us.
9/23/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"One of the best concerts I've ever been to. The venue staff were all super sweet and helpful, the show was great, my seat was easy to find and everything sounded amazing. I hope coldplay come back to seattle"
8/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,My favorite band always bless us with the best show! This was my second show of MOTS and I‚Äôll be seeing them again. There‚Äôs no other band in the world like Coldplay!!
7/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Absolutely Fantastic, from start to finish concert was so uplifting, full of energy, talent, atmosphere and Great time by ALl"
7/17/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was truly amazing. Great music, fireworks and lights. The only thing negative  was that it was a little too loud. It almost sounded like it was blowing the speakers at times. I honestly think it would have sounded even better if it were down a few decibels. I‚Äôm surprised Chris Martin wouldn't be more sensitive to the volume."
7/13/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Great show! Loved the wrist bands lighting the audience up. None stop action. Sounded great live. Very entertaining ‚ò∫Ô∏è
6/29/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay puts on an EXCELLENT show. We had so much fun, and it was worth every penny. I would definitely go see them again!"
6/28/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"One of the most fun concerts I've ever been to! Coldplay puts on quite a show! Great set selection. Always energizing music. The band really seems to have fun - and we all do too. Fun with the wristbands that changed colors, and the balloons, and the paper stars falling. Kept the stadium rocking!"
6/28/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I WANT TO GO AGAIN!! If I were to express how much I loved this concert then this would be so long but It was absolutely amazing to be short, the best concert I have been to thus far. if you love Coldplay or even if you aren't familiar with them, you will love this. The energy in the stadium was unmatchable. You just knew there were people there who have been fans for decades and people who were new and caught on and loved it. H.E.R. was absolutely fantastic and so talented."
6/27/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,That was the best concert ever!!! It was so much fun and interactive and all the lights and you just wanted to dance and sing the whole time and so many different people all singing and laughing together. It was just so amazing and I can't wait to see them again!!!!
6/24/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This was my first concert and it was seriously one of the best experiences of my life I love this band so much and even in nosebleed seats it was amazing the venue was amazing the bathrooms were clean and it was easy to find what you need the only bad thing I would have to say is it was hard to find parking but that‚Äôs it!!!!! üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú
6/23/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"It was almost a religious experience. Coldplay put on an amazing show that made everybody leave in a happy mood (and this despite some crazy heavy rain on the way out). The lights, fireworks, sound, connection between fans and band- everything was unlike anything i've ever seeb. By the way, i did not previously consider myself a huge colday fan, but i recommend anybody interested to go to their concert. Plus, it was reasonably priced! You won't regret it."
6/23/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The best Concert. Music and lights are amazingly, My family and I were very excited enjoying the coldplay concert.  I congratulate you for the logistics and organization of the event."
6/23/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Absolutely AMAZING!!!! Emotional, full of energy and vibrant colors. It was my first Coldplay concert and I can‚Äôt wait to see them perform again! I could cry just to think about the big deal this was for me and my friends."
6/22/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The Coldplay concert at Lincoln Financial Field was amazing!  I hadn't been to a concert in many years until that night, and I was blown away! The wristband lights made the stadium glow so beautifully. But most importantly, the music was awesome!  I would see Coldplay again in a heartbeat! The only downside to the night was the horrendous TRAFFIC getting to LFF (we sat in one spot for almost 30 minutes, right near our parking spot) and then again when leaving the parking lot after the concert. Other than the traffic/parking, it was a wonderful night!!!"
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,COLDPLAY puts on the best concert ever. Their performance and music is beyond exceptional. Totally worth every penny! Love them.
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The venue was good, the event well planned and of course the band was the utmost best part of the night. If there is something I could say was bad would be the traffic after the show and the lack of transportation. Uber and other apps didn‚Äôt have drivers available and many of us had to walk great distances to get to our hotels."
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Every detail was taken care of‚Äîa complete experience from the beginning to the end. ColdPlay and HER well-executed. Thanks for being part of this concert.
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay did a great performance in a warm environment; their songs, lights effects and outstanding charisma allow us to watch a great show."
6/22/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"What can I say, simply amazing!! I first saw Coldplay in 2016 when they came to Indianapolis.  I had such an amazing time, I knew I just had to see them the next chance I got.  Went to see them this year in Chicago at Soldier Field, which by the way was awesome b/c it was open and you had a view of the skyline plus fireworks.   Both tours they give you wristbands that light up to the beats of the songs.  They had kinetic bikes and dance pads so the crowd could use and it that helped provide energy for their shows. They are such awesome performers, great songs, and overall a great group of guys.  If you get the chance, go see them, I promise you won't regret it!"
6/21/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was one of the best concerts i think I've ever seen! It was very interactive with the light bracelets and very creative playing along with the music and theme. The fireworks, lights, beach balls, lasers were all a great touch to keep the concert engaging!!!! Overall, such a great show! Can't wait to see their next tour!!!!"
6/20/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay never lets you down!! Whether you are on the floor or in the nose bleeders, they seem to manage reaching everyone with a great live show!! The light up wrist bands are one of my fave parts!!!"
6/20/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,One of the best shows I‚Äôve ever seen and this is my 3rd time seeing them. The whole robot head and puppet duets were not my thing but terrific show all around!
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I will remember this concert for life, Cold Play puts on an awesome show (family friendly, with the exception of a few curse words) and the lights were amazing! Unfortunately the opening acts (Gigi and H.E.R), do not put on a very good show.  I'd expect a bigger/more well known talent to open for these guys.  In addition, the opening acts dragged on for over 90 minutes. I admit Cold Play made up for it, but next time find a better opening act and try not to be 'so' late to the stage."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This was the most entertaining and enjoyable concert I have ever been to. The music speaks for itself, however, the energy gathering bicycles, kinetic dance floors and interactive activities with the audience before and during the show where inspiring! Coldplay supplies their own green energy for the show and sponsors many global initiatives from energy, food, rewilding and environmental concerns. 
We were also supplied with bracelets when entering the stadium which were used to generate an exciting audience light show. In addition, there were fireworks, laser lights, confetti and multi sized/colored balls which were in play most of the show. 
We have all most likely seen some of these things at other concerts but when have you seen all these things during one show in its entirety? Awesome! 
It was hot, no, sweltering! It didn‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôd come again without even a split second thought. 
Thank you Coldplay! You are more than awesome!"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"genuinely this was a concert that can be enjoyed by anyone whether they listen to coldplay or not. it was beautiful, magical, surreal, everything i expected and much much much more. their live songs were even better than recordings and the way they used lights on everyone‚Äôs wristbands and ABSOLUTELY took advantage of being in an open stadium to use so so so many fireworks and everything was amazing. The light up wristbands made the experience so beautiful as they were coordinated by seating section to create specific light patterns and shapes and movements it was so creative and beautiful. Everyone should get to experience one of their concerts once in their life."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I loved everything. Just one thing that bothered me. I had a mini purse and one of the staff guys didn‚Äôt let me in just because he said that my purse was too big. I had to return 3 blocks to let it in the car. Many people inside the stadium had their purses and bags with them, even bigger than mine."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,From the moment Coldplay came on stage to their bows- the performance was amazing.  I am so glad to have attended;  i took my grandson (12 years) to his first concert and I am quite sure it will always be an eve he won‚Äôt forget.
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"My mind was blown at the showmanship of this band.
I have enjoyed their music for years and had no idea of the fantastic show I would experience.
Stage lasers, confetti and fireworks were on point. Stage configuration was optimized for all the fans to enjoy and when they moved to the ‚Äòback‚Äô stage and gave the fans in the back a great view, I was impressed at how thoughtful they are to their fans."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Been a fan of Coldplay for 20 years, this was our 3rd concert and I think the best one. The wrist bands lighting up made a judge difference visually and Chris is awesome"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Love their music, first time we attend to their concert, it was the best experience of our life, We took our two sons one of them is a musician and super fan of their music. They have an incredible experience one of a kind, one I am sure they will NEVER NEVER forget. Everything went perfect, the sound, lights, the show, the positive environment. I really have no words to describe how incredible this concert was. We are crazy to see them again!"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This was hands down the BEST concert I have ever been to. The openers, Gigi and H.E.R., were amazing. And Coldplay was life-changing; their show had such amazing energy!"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Loved every second of this show. The stadium was a great venue easy to get in and out of. Of course Coldplay put on a show of a lifetime. This  show particularly was my fourth one this tour. It gets better and better every time. Thank you for such great memories Coldplay.
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"A coldplay concert is a whole different experience, from beginning to end. Regardless if you are a coldplay fan or not, if you attend this concert you will enjoy it to the fullest. The music, the lights, the special effects, the props, the bracelets that light up, the bikes, the kinetic energy floors, the fireworks just make this concert be a complete and amazing experience, your adrenaline will rise to the highest levels. Coldplay played the best hits they have during this show, you will dance and sign your heart out beginning to end. I have seen coldplay three times, this was my favorite one, definitely this is one coldplay concert you don't want to miss."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay was amazing. !  I would go see them again anytime.  I was so worried about retrieving the tickets from my phone, but it was easy. I would definitely use ticketmaster again."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"You won‚Äôt live a show like the one that Coldplay performs twice in your life, this experience will be in my memories forever. Thank you Coldplay!"
6/19/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Title says it all. Coldplay was amazing, the way they included all attendees in the show using light-up wristbands was creative and beautiful to see in action. But the aftermath was a nightmare and the reason that was the last time I go to a show at MetLife. Friend who was supposed to pick us up couldn't get through bc of road closures by traffic cops, PABT-bound bus line had easily over 1000 people waiting on it, Lyft app was not connecting to drivers bc of the high demand. Ended up walking to the mall across the overpass and, after failing to get a Lyft driver to pick us up there either, met the friend who had originally tried to pick us up, over 1.5 hours after the show ended. Unless you have an easy way out (your own car), the stress is not worth it."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It was the best concert I've ever been to. The crowd was so excited, everyone was up and dancing. They had bracelets that lit up with the music, and huge balloons for the crowd to hit around the stadium. Chris knows how to get the audience to participate and let us know how much he appreciated us coming out on a super hot Tuesday evening. Multiple stages, 23 songs and we were up dancing to each one. LOVE that they had the stationary bikes, kinetic mat, etc generating energy to run the concert. I LOVE COLDPLAY. Can't wait to see them in concert again. Funtastic time, the vibe of the crowd was overwhelming happiness."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I couldn't ask for more. Even we the heat, the concert was everything I expected to be and so much more. The band had an incredible energy and stage. They even wrote a special song for Tampa."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay was amazing! First time seeing them! Absolutely an electrifying performance and show! If you ever get a chance to see them you should! Worth it and would see them again!

The opener H.E.R. was not good. Her mic was off , her instruments didn‚Äôt sound like they were sound checked correctly. Way off especially compared to Coldplay. It just didn‚Äôt make sense to have her as the opener. The sounds , songs and everything just didn‚Äôt work and a lot of people left their seats."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Hi! I'm 19, and I thought i ""wasn't a big enough fan of Coldplay"" to see them, and I was wrong. Despite only knowing their most popular songs, this was a DO NOT MISS event, and completely worthy of seeing. I am so glad I did it, and despite probably not being a huge a fan as the millennials going to see Coldplay, I also grew up with them and it was amazing"
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,It was wild. When it started it got a little out of control because everyone was pushing others to see the band but overall it was the best concert!!
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Went to the Tampa show.  This might have been one of the best shows I have gone to.  I had seen them once before in Kansas City and thought that was amazing, this was over the top EXCELLENT.  This is coming from a huge Peter Gabriel/ Genesis Fan who really enjoys the staging and lighting.  This is a MUST SEE show."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,I have never gone to a concert by myself so I was a little curious how seeing ColdPlay would be especially down on the floor. The experience itself was refreshing no matter how hot and humid it was. I had one of the highlights of my life being able to see ColdPlay before me and an experience I would gladly re-live all over again and again.
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay definitely the best band in the world!! They made a lovely night to remember and I wish more concert to come
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,The best concert experience ever. My second Coldplay concert. They just keep getting better. The music and special effects all come together.
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Concert was perfect. Coldplay did excellent. Even though I was sad, they made me forgot my problems and enjoy the spectacular show."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It was a hot night at Raymond James Field. Expectation were high before the concert was to start at 7 PM but having to wait over 2 hours past the starting time until Coldplay took the stage, listening to 2 opening acts, made it difficult to rate this concert experience any higher. For the LED wristbands to reach their maximum effect, I realize they needed darkness and thus the after 9 PM start for Coldplay, but if the announced start time would have been 8 PM instead of 7 PM, we could have better used that time instead of listening to two acts that do not compliment Coldplay.  Once Coldplay started the 1st 60 minutes was one of the best concert experiences but the last 60 minutes was dull. A couple of times they had to restart songs and then near the end, a couple talked their way on to the stage so that the gentleman could propose awkwardly. The 2nd 60 minutes did not provide the energy of the 1st 60 minutes and seemed like the band just wanted the night to end."
6/19/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"Exciting show and entertaining, but it was very obvious those in charge of sound had not gotten out from behind their headphones, because the speaker sound was incredibly bad. I've been to other shows where speakers end up bursting, and this sounded very close to that. Really was a MAJOR distraction to the show."
6/18/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Sound quality for opening act H.E.R. was terrible, very echoey and distorted. A bit better during her acoustic songs, moved down to 2nd level concourse across from stage‚Ä¶ still bad"
6/18/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The venue, the show, the crowd interaction, the special effects‚Ä¶ There is nothing I would change. Coldplay is and always be the best live performance you will ever see!"
6/18/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I took my HS twins to their first show.  They may never see a better one because i haven't.    Only thing close was U2 Achtune Baby.
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"From the security, organization, the sound, the lights effect and tha band performance. My friends and I agree that this has been the best concert we have ever seen. I had a lot of complications with my travel, lodging and everything but I would go through everything all over again just to see them!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This is my third Coldplay concert, and they were great as usual.  Their live sound combined with the wristbands make it an amazing experience every time.  The only thing I would change is taking the puppet gimmick out and playing Coloratura, but that‚Äôs splitting hairs.  If you have the chance to see these guys when they do their second leg, seize the opportunity"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I have been going to concerts for the past 20 years all over the state of Florida!  Never did we had to wait 2 hours to get picked up by a share ride!  This is due to the extremely bad organization at the stadium!  Coldplay was awesome, one of the best performances, however the exit/dismissal system that the Raymond James stadium has almost ruined our experience!  We will never attend another concert there!!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The concert musically & spiritually had so much to offer.. I appreciate you enlightening your audience & the younger generations to pending environmental issues. I‚Äôm elated your band chose to remain together, as a group you have so much offer.
My only critique is Chris, easy on the F bomb..please DRock"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The show and Chris Martin was fantastic with plenty of visual pleasures with everyone having a synced color changing wristband, to fireworks, to confetti and the whole package.

Raymond James (from the 200 club section perspective) is AWFUL. Sounded like noise and hurt my ears...I've been to many...many shows but anything inside a stadium or even worse, inside all together for this type of music turns out awful.

Coldplay and many other artists who put on energetic shows need locations where music doesn't bounce back and reverberate off every wall around. 

3 stars out of 3 for the band (Coldplay) 0 of 2 for the venue (Raymond James)"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,All I can say is that Coldplay performance had me with goosebumps and with so much tears of excitement? Very good show definitely grab your seats and enjoy the show!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay was amazing I would see them a millions times if I could it‚Äôs a must show see. Can‚Äôt wait until they come again. Hope they don‚Äôt take so much time for their come back to Florida!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I really enjoy the concert it was a perfect , the sound, the energy, the venue. 

The only thing that i was not happy was the organization with the Uber pick up & drop off it was a disaster. And another thing was the mini bag / purse rule at the Stadium. I was with medium purse and i was already there when the tell us about this rule. For next time it would great to hace that kind of info in advance."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,so fun!!! definitely one of the best concerts i‚Äôve ever been to. they made us put our phones away so we can all just vibe to Viva La Vida and it was one of the best experiences ever
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Been waiting years for Coldplay to play in Florida again. For me, it was a ""can't miss"" show. After seeing it, they are now a ""can't miss"" band. The concert was absolutely phenomenal.
If I could go again tomorrow, I would. Such a positive energy throughout the whole show. Visual effects were stunning. Quite possibly the best concert I've ever attended!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Hi. I live in Honduras, Central America.
 ticketmaster app is not available for latinamerica  so create confusion to get the tickets. I knew that the app is available for Mexico so I don¬¥t know if it work fine for all countries in latinamerica."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The concert on June 14, 2022, was my first Coldplay concert and it did not disappoint!  The band had incredible energy from the start to the end!  They performed fan favorites (e.g., Sparks, Clocks, Hymn for the Weekend) as well as songs from the Music of the Spheres.  They rocked People of the Pride!  H.E.R. joined Chris for Let Somebody Go - phenomenal duet!  I hope Coldplay continues performing for many years, because I want to see them in concert again!  #ColdplayTampa"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Aside from the usual save the world lectures and propaganda films , this was a visual and musical tour de force. Definitely top 5 concerts I've ever attended."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay put on the most amazing concert I have ever been to, hands down. The energy, the mix of old and new songs, the LIGHTS! Everything was absolutely perfect. I can‚Äôt think of one bad thing to say, I will never forget that night! If you have the chance to see them, do it! Again and again."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay never disappoints!! This was a special show for us as it was my son‚Äôs first Coldplay show! The music was amazing, and Coldplay fans are all so loving and supportive which makes for such a wonderful vibe! So proud of Coldplay for all of their sustainable initiatives on this tour as well. We had a great time riding the bikes and dancing on the kinetic floors to help power the C stage for the next show! We will always cherish our time together rocking out with Coldplay! Just wish they had another show in our area to see them again!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,John Williams! a packed crowd! An original song just for Tampa Bay! Fireworks! The wave! Viva La Vida! Sky Full of Stars! My Universe! Higher Power! All in one package!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,This was an amazing concert you couldfeel the beams in the stadium flexing from all the dancing and jumping. The light show was phenomenal! Glad we went!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It was exciting to be a part of the all positive energy that Coldplay brought to the stage from beginning to the end! I loved being a part of the show, from the wrist bands, the beautiful colorful balls, entire stadium singing with every song! Spectacular light and fireworks show! 
One of the most memorable concerts of my lifetime!
Thank you Coldplay for supporting Ocean Cleanup and reforestation, many thanks for sharing!
A side note, we were treated so kindly by all stadium personal, from the concession people to the greeters coming and going! Great experience for sure!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,The venue was great! Nice seats. The  food/drinks area had AC and bathrooms were super clean. The concert was amazing.. I love how interactive it was.. the energy was great! Loved it.
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"If there is a better show anywhere, I‚Äôd like to know about it. Wow! What an amazing night. Just can‚Äôt imagine there is a better stadium show‚Ä¶.anywhere."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,This concert was epic and easily the best concert I‚Äôve ever been to. The concert was interactive and so much fun. They played for 2 and some hours. The crowd was awesome. We were all still singing walking out of the stadium!  It felt like we all knew each other. I look forward to being able to see them again.
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"There is not enough words to describe how amazing was the concert, all the lights, how the band performed it was just I N C R E D I B L E 10/10"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"While the production of Coldplay was excellent with there sound, light and firework display, H.E.R left us holding our ears. Some people may like to be screamed at, we prefer hearing the melody and words. The male lead singer of the band was pleasant to listen to."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"From the first seconds until the last Chris Martin and band blew the minds of everyone there. A stadium filled with love, electricity, kindness, and music. A night to not be forgotten."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It has always been a lifelong dream to see Coldplay live. This concert exceeded all of my expectations completely!! They are so genuine and talented and put on such a captivating, lively show. FANTASTIC!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Traffic to get to the stadium, was terrible, but once I got there, getting in was fast and easy. They allowed me to bring in my camera too. I was very happy about that. It was a beautiful  show, with amazing special effects. An inspiring message to the world about conservation, peace, and love."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Always the best concerts by Coldplay! Amazing on every level! Chris Martin rocked the Buccs stadium to its core!! Thanks for giving all of your fans such a special show!!!!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,The music was fantastic but the added lighting effect brought the concert way over the top.  It was very obvious that Cold Play was there to put on a great show and really care about the people. This is an event that has set a new standard for me.
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Loved. Loved. Loved the show. Coldplay puts their heart into every song. The stage set was unreal and the lighted bracelets made every single person in that stadium feel like they played a part. SO happy I saw this show!!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Took my husband for his birthday. This was the best concert that I have ever been to! He shared that same sentiment. Both artists were absolutely amazing and Coldplay put on an amazing show. The stadium was full and the crowd completely interactive. There was an educational element with regards to preservation that was amazing as well!!! The lighted wristbands were awesome and genius!!! My husband was the Coldplay fan coming into the concert. We were both fans of both artists by the end of the concert!!!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Absolutely loved Coldplay. They never disappoint. From the tremendous energy to the light up wrist bands coordinated to music; it was great. The one minor complaint would be that there was an echo from the back speakers. It wasn't noticeable all the time, but it was there. The venue was also great."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The general seating layout was horrible, everyone was crammed in and it was 95 degrees outside, folks were passing out given how crammed it was. I would suggest Coldplay rethink their seething arrangements."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I loved everything about the concert, although there were some songs I would have loved for Coldplay to play that they didn't, but I understand... Regardless of that, it was still a beautiful experience and the best concert I've ever been to.

BUT, the only thing I didn't like was how the venue was not prepared with the things Coldplay said it was going to do like for example having free aluminum cups with ice (heck, I would have still payed for it to be honest) and various water stations for people to get water... We weren't allowed to bring any type of water bottles inside, so we had to buy a $7 regular plastic water bottle just so that we could stay hydrated during the concert, and get this, they didn't give us the bottle cap because now they wanted to be green even though there was already a solution for that with the aluminum cups. And the whole thing about the bottle caps was weird and inconsistent because some people did have their caps with their bottles."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Imagine a place filled with thousands of beautiful people from all nations and colors, all genders and ages, all of them having fun and living harmoniously. People are celebrating life, treating each other with respect, equanimity, and enjoying the universal religion: Music! singing and dancing freely and joyfully. 

Well that Tuesday summer full moon night in the Tampa Buccaneer's Stadium with Coldplay was just that!
  
There was so much creativity, love and consciousness in this ritual for healing the earth!

A truly magical night full of fun, conscious awakening and gratitude from this MASTER ARTISTS they are a true inspiration and blessing to this precious planet!

Coldplay is not just a band it is a catalyst for the change our planet needs to thrive ‚ù§Ô∏èüåéüåöüåù

May all beings experience such joy and awaken to their true nature.

Om Ah Hum"
6/17/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay was amazing. They can throw a show and have you smiling all night. Fireworks, interactive bracelets and a good time!"
6/17/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The whole experience was awesome! The sound, the brazalets and their scene experience. This is going to be unforgettable for all the people that were there."
6/17/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Went to this concert on a whim. Did not regret it. The most amazing concert ever. If you have a chance to see coldplay live. Do it
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The Coldplay concert was a beautiful experience. Their set list blended a great mix of songs from their catalog and latest album. The production value was top notch. It really did feel like we were all part of the band singing along throughout the show. Coldplay is one of the best bands to experience live, if not the best, because their songs are made for big arenas. Will definitely plan to see them again in the future!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,The absolute best! This was my 3rd show and each time they one up and it‚Äôs better than the last üíú
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay is the greatest show I‚Äôve ever experienced. I would pay $1000 to see them. I was sad as soon as it started because I didn‚Äôt want it to end. Genuine energy and enjoyment.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Fireworks , songs , ambience and venue were just sensational! We came from Ireland and didn‚Äôt want the evening to end ! When are you guys coming to Dublin ??"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coming from Ireland it was a thrill to see Coldplay in Tampa ! The venue was incredible and the concert just amazing ! Chris and co were on point and we loved every minute of it ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è I left wondering when we could see them again ‚ò∫Ô∏è
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I loved  every part of the concert.  It has been years since i have attended a concert.   My daughter picked this group because of the message in their music.    The profanity ruined some of the excitement.
I will watch the youtube version going forward."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"David at guest service helped me with a handicap accessible seat with no hassle to pick up 
Seat location was excellent
Show was just Perfect!!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This band never disappoints. Their live performance is amazing with sounds that rival their  original recording quality. The pyrotechnics, confetti, and interactive wristbands took the whole experience up to another level. The green initiatives, the inclusivity to make the concert accessible. What can I say just overall an excellent experience."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,i love how they had the light up bracelets it made the whole stadium look amazing and especially the balloons and confetti they launched into the crowd. It was a truly amazing experience.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This was the best concert I have ever been to. Coldplay somehow makes it feel like one big party. The bad news is that Coldplay set the bar pretty high, they have ruined all other concerts for me.

The last time I saw them was the Head Full of Dreams tour in Boston. I took my sister who didn‚Äôt know 1 song by Coldplay (crazy, I know) She turned to me in the middle of the show and said it was literally the best concert she had ever been to."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I like the fact that they are having initiatives to make a sustainable world, by reforesting, cleaning the oceans and making renewal energy."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It was perfect!   Chris was perfect.  Seeing Coldplay was on my bucket list.  I could have listened longer!  Could have had my own personal request list‚Ä¶.but he had a great blend of his old hits and new music.  I loved the evening!  Thank you Coldplay!   Good, clean fun!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I have been dying to see Coldplay for decades but they rarely come to Florida, let alone Tampa. The performace, crowd interactions, special effects and lighting made thisshow a true experience. Considering Chris Martin was so kind to make a song for us, ""Tampa Bay Tuesday"" hopefully they'll come back to see us soon. Venues should push for them to come back. I truly loved how Coldplay went above and beyond to not only provide a great show but also to make it as sustainable as possible. Perhaps venues will follow suit and do what they can to also make all shows and events sustainable."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,I‚Äôve seen a lot of shows in my life but Coldplay was amazing!!!! The energy the engagement of the audience. The lights fireworks and the music Ofcourse. All amazing. This show moved me!!! Coldplay you are fire!!! Thank you!!!
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,I've been going to shows for over 20 years and this is by far the best show I've attended to date. It was fantastic. I will definitely be seeing them again when they come back.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay is amazing, everyone should them in concert. I can‚Äôt believe I waited this long. I got chills and cried. Everything from the light up bracelets (I don‚Äôt want to ever see another show without them), to the fireworks, sound, everything was perfect. I love that they care about the environment and world. Seriously, I will never forget it."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Every second of this concert was absolutely the most fun. Honestly the most joyful, happy, fun experience I've had in quite some time.
Loved the show!!!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Everything was great, from how easy it was to buy the tickets, to the last song, the opening act?, very good, both Gigi and H.E.R (Gabi), they were fantastic, but Cold play is another level, it's a great show , the play of light with the bracelets, the giant bombs, the kinetic energy, wow, my wife and I were fascinated!!!, thank you very much"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,This is a must go to show! The lights and fireworks and music is phenomenal! Cold play is a band I will every time they come near my area!!
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I have been trying to see Coldplay since the 2010‚Äôs. I grew up listening to X&Y/Rush of Blood to the Head in the car with my mom. I have since fallen in love with every album. Once I knew they were coming to Tampa this in 2022, I bought the tickets 7 months in advance. I took my mom‚Äì it was everything we could have hoped for. Best concert I‚Äôve every been to!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay was Amazing. But every word they sang came back so it made the experience less than perfect. But coldplay had such an amazing energy it made anything else no important. My best concert
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Went with my two kids and 2 friends. We had the best experience. Venue was great, comfortable seats. Concert was amazing. One of the best I have been to. Great energy, light show, fireworks, screens for easy viewing from far away, music and sound quality. Loved that part of proceeds go to support sustainability projects all around the world, and that they use fan created energy to power the show. Plus the music from Coldplay is just amazing!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Obviously the music was phenomenal. This is to be expected from Coldplay. The lights, colors, pyro, and interactive stimulation made the concert a true experience. We saw them live last time they toured in Miami and they, again, brought it with tons of energy and positive vibes. Great show!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It was an extremely hot night even for FL! That was the last concert of the band from their North America leg and they definitely as always made us feel special, poured their hearts out! They had an excellent mixture of the band‚Äôs long time favorites and some of the new songs. The Raymond James staff did their best however I have to mention banning the designated smoking section outside of the floor and seating areas but allowing all the pot smoking all over the place was one of the things I did not agree with."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay was freaking awesome!!! I am so glad I was able to take my daughter it was her first concert.... H.E.R.... the talent was extremely impressive!!!!
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This by far was one of, if not the best concert I‚Äôve ever attended. Great compilation between new and classic Coldplay songs. I will go again and again to see Coldplay!!!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,It was an expensive experience but I‚Äôm so glad I went! I try to be economical when attending concerts. They are top performers! I am an avid concert goer & I thoroughly enjoyed the concert. It exceeded all my expectations. I highly recommend seeing Coldplay live if you have the chance!
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"We have seen 80-100 concerts over the years and saw Coldplay in another stadium venue in 2016. Although Coldplay, H.E.R. and Gigi did the best they could their talent and energies could not make up for the absolutely pitiful acoustics of Raymond James Stadium. The sound was nothing short of noise as the sound bounced off no less than 5 different locations around the stadium. Distortion was the name of the game once this happened for all three bands. H.E.R. was so bad we almost left before Coldplay even did their portion. AVOID RAYMOND JAMES STADIUM AT ALL COST! WHAT A WASTE OF OVER $1000 FOR OUR TWO TICKETS. WE WILL NEVER ATTEND ANOTHER CONCERT AT RAYMOND JAMES EVEN IF OFFERED TICKETS FOR FREE. WHAT AN ABSOLUTELY PITIFUL VENUE!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I had a great time, everything was in order; the only thing that I can point out is that there were not enough lockers since we didn‚Äôt know that there was an specific size for the bag that we can enter in the place other than that everything was great, I loved it"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Wooooow! That‚Äôs all I can say is wow. I‚Äôve attended well over 100+ concerts and this was the best performance I‚Äôve seen- you don‚Äôt even have to be a fan of their music to enjoy the concert.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Wish I would‚Äôve been able to make it but COVID hit us the day of the concert üò≠ Im sure coldplay was freaking awesome as always
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Took my wife to the Coldplay concert and it was great. The opening singer was okay then the next was better and Coldplay was great.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Great concert lotta fun. I would highly recommend the floor for anyone that‚Äôs a true fan that‚Äôs going or just wants to have a good time to. I don‚Äôt want to leave any spoilers but if you like the music or even if you barely like the music you will be happy you went.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I‚Äôve wanted to see Coldplay for years and a concert at Raymond James.  They did not disappoint!!  H.E.R. was phenomenal and Coldplay played so many of their great songs.  Beverage lines were reasonably quick and staff was great.  Only complaint would be access to restrooms for anyone on the floor level like we were.  Only one set that we were aware of and they were on the other end and outside of the stadium.  Otherwise, loved the bands and the venue!!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"So far, I've been to 118 concerts through my entire life and Coldplay's concert is certainly in the top 10. I've seen them twice and if you haven't, you are missing an awesome opportunity to have a lot of fun. Those lights, man! Thousands and thousands of lights! You can't go wrong here."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Literally the best concert I've ever been to! It's a life experience that is priceless and completely worth it. AFREAKINGmazing üòç

6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Best live show hands down. The production, light up wrist bands, fireworks etc were amazing. And the fact that they have a sustainable tour and donate to various environmental non-profits is well worth the money"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The Tampa Bay Raymond James Stadium June 14th 2022. It was absolutely Amazing, Great Job to All the Band memory and there Band Support. 
Great Job!!!!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This is definitely one of the very best live performances I have ever experienced! That‚Äôs no small statement‚Ä¶ I have placed high priority on live music events my entire life, and I‚Äôm no spring chicken. Coldplay was DEFINITELY in the top three live performances I have ever seen! Trust me! Do not miss this show!!!"

6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Drove 3 hrs to see them, wish they had added a date/venue close to me further down in SWFL. 
Great live performance, great vibes, great crowd. This was my first time seeing Coldplay live and will definitely go again if they tour back in the US"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay is not only the best band but their concert is an experience like no other. The vibe and energy is just everything. Will never forget it & hope to see them again some day.

6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,This is was without a shadow of a doubt the best concert I‚Äôve ever been to. Coldplay‚Äôs attention to detail made for a full experience incorporating all senses from beginning to start. A sweet note was all of the sustainable choices they encouraged. My heart will be full for a very long time!
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay‚Äôs 2022 concert in Tampa was epic! They are hands down the greatest rock and roll band of 21st century.

6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Everything from their energy, activism, light show, presence / attention to the crowd, request for crown to put phones down and be present, quality, duration and more made this a truly stellar experience. We went as a group of 4, most of us have seen a large quantity of shows over our lives, and we all agreed this was the best show we have seen, hands down!

With the opening bands, GIGI and SHE, the sow was over 4 hours long. The stadium was packed with lots of Happy Folks. I waited 10 years to see them and couldn‚Äôt be happier!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Wow what a show they put on. There‚Äôs nothing like the energy and excitement Coldplay exudes.  I didn‚Äôt sit for 2 hours.  The wristband lights are just amazing and everyone feels so connected.  Can‚Äôt wait till they come again!!!

6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I‚Äôve been to many live shows and I really feel this band puts a lot of effort into showing gratitude and appreciation for the audience.

Not only do they include the audience and involve them but put on an amazing light show by giving every person who had a ticket an LED wristband, dimming all the lights and then controlling an entire light show through the entire audience which include multiple colors different flashing series of light waves across the stadium even drawing shapes.

They also had amazing backdrop on their monitors and fireworks and fire on the stage.

They changed outfits several times were costumes and even allowed someone to come up and propose during the show.

It was my first time seeing Coldplay, and I would have no problem getting tickets to see another show when it was local again"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Awesome show!  It was my two little boys first concert.  8 and 10 years old and honestly the perfect one to go to!  I loved the band for their great messages.  We love the environment and our Mother Earth, we love our neighbors and community and we appreciate using the platform to project the need for change.  The LED wristbands were beautiful in the stadium, the energy was electric.  Our seats weren't the best in the house and it's hard with short kids when everyone stands but of course that comes with it and we had a blast.  Even if you don't seek out Coldplay's music daily, but enjoy it, I would 10 out of 10 recommend their show."

6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Travel from Puerto Rico only to see Coldplay in concert. It was a spectacular show, from music to fireworks. I loved it, I want to repeat it again. I hope you are encouraged to take the Coldplay concert to Puerto Rico!‚ù§Ô∏è"

6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,I had to pay 40 dollars to park. Thought it was ridiculous mainly after the show when it was a mess to get out. I had to wait more than 2 hours after the show to get my car out of the congestion. I expected much more since I paid 40 dollars and Coldplay emphasized the greeness and sustainability thing during the whole concert. I ask you: where is the sustainability thing when you pay 40 dollars to park and have to be on a line over 2 hours with your car on?! That was REAL hypocrisy.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"In love with all the sound, lightning. Stage, fireworks‚Ä¶listening a Coldplay live was another level of experience."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Absolutely amazing.From the use of sustainable energy to fuel the shows to involving the audience in a highly immersive experience.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay surpassed my friend & I‚Äôs expectations. It was an unreal experience. The feeling of unity was so strong. Chris Martin‚Äôs voice is even better in person & their visuals/stage setup was on another level. This is a must-see.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"However parking at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa is a nightmare,  unorganized,  and an accident waiting to happen."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"One of the best concerts I‚Äôve ever been to! Never been to a concert with so many people and the production as far as the lights,wristbands and fireworks were amazing!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,they were awesome!! my boyfriend and i have been listening to Coldplay since we were little kids and it was such a cool experience to see our idols preform and be apart of their legacy.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay was the best show I had ever seen in my life!!!! They are amazing!!!! Hands down worth every penny!!! I absolutely recommend this concert!!!! Coldplay has my heart forever!!!
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Here we have never experience a concert like the one Coldplay offer!!! The sound, the music, the organization and the play wt color awesome!!!!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"High energy.  Colourful backstage .  Fireworks, paper confetti in yellow, red and multitude of colours, giant balls and wrist bands that lit up the night.  Great music, wonderful audience participation and even a proposal allowed on stage.  Have seen Coldplay 3-4 x‚Äôs in the past.  They have never disappointed and I am blessed to have been able to see them again. Could it have been any ‚Äòhotter‚Äô. Not sure!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay is one of the best live shows I‚Äôve ever experienced. Doesn‚Äôt matter where you sit, it‚Äôs a visual experience. I even recommend not being on the floor, the light up wristbands looks way better the higher up you sit. I wish there was a merch stand on the floor. It was very difficult to get form the floor up to find merch. So I missed a few songs trying to figure that out."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay was absolutely amazing!!! The Music of the Spheres Tour was Beautiful!!!üõ∏ü™êüëΩüåéüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà‚ù§Ô∏è I honestly can‚Äôt wait to see them again!!
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Concert was great, only complaint and no small one was the Raymond James Stadium providing absolutely no protection from the harsh summer sun. At least a handful of people required medical attention due to the heat. Room for improvement!!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,It was everything I had hoped for and more. I bought tickets for my husband and I and we had so much fun! Such an awesome experience
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It was an amazing show, from the wrist bands to the fireworks to all the favorite songs. We danced almost non-stop for 2 hours! And then H.E.R. was the gravy. She is stunning and her singing with Chris was perfection."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay not only sounded fantastic but put on a very entertaining show from the beginning to the end!  I cannot wait to see them again someday.
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I was fortunate to be able to take my 21 year old daughter to see Coldplay!!  We enjoyed the opening acts, but when Coldplay came on they lit up the Bay!! With lights, fireworks and their incredible music!!  What a show!!  Thanks Mates for sharing your music with us and the positive message your music brings!!   Love every minute of my time with my daughter and one of our new shared favorite bands!!"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This concert is the best I've ever gone. The show is great, the quality of the band is one of the better I‚Äôve ever seen, and the level of energy is the best. One of my dreams was to see this band performing and was completely valuable"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Amazing show, over the top in many ways, Lighting up bracelets pens as you came in stages all over the floor just all-around a good experience"
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"They crushed it.  Music, lights, pyro, energy, the whole thing‚Ä¶.easily best show I‚Äôve seen live.  Want to see them again now."
6/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"A true performance. They are entertainers through and through. What an amazing show. Bravo to the production, the crowd interactions and the overall experience.  Amazing"
6/16/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay put on an amazing show as always, My wife and I met our friends at the stadium to eat dinner there as we had heard about the good food selection that was available. My wife and I and our friends decided to try the BBQ Bacon Cheesesteak that was being hawked when we walked in the entrance. We split our cheesesteak between the two of us. The first thing I noticed was how little meat there seemed to be compared to the bread. The next thing I noticed was the relatively bland taste of the sandwich once I took a bite. Definitely not worth the $15 they charge for this so called sandwich. Once we made it into the stadium we walked around checking out the other food offerings and we saw Love and Honey Fried Chicken and decided to try it. I noticed the signs they had up at the registers promoting the positive reviews that they have received. That always makes me a little nervous as I‚Äôve had experiences where places glide along on good press and nothing else. I am happy to report that Love and Honey lives up to their press. After being handed our chicken sandwich which was bigger than the bun I couldn‚Äôt wait to split this with my wife due to the enticing aroma. After one bite of this sandwich I was hooked. This is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. I look forward to eating one of these sandwiches again and I will make the trek to there original location so I won‚Äôt have to wait until the next time I am at the Linc"
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Beautiful. Not even the biggest Coldplay fan but we had to see this iconic band. So creative and mesmerizing experience, not a concert, and experience. Cried twice, got drunk. Yeah üòé"
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"One of the best shows I have ever been to.  Great music, great show, excellent sound, and outstanding visuals with the wristbands and the video displays.  Excellent that the band plays along the length of the venue so they connect with everyone instead of just those at the front or on the floor."
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was by far the best concert I've ever been too! The venue was cool and we had awesome floor tickets and were able to be so close to the stage. The entire band walked through the crowd right where we were standing! They played hit after hit and of course the technical aspect of the concert was top notch - cool lighting, kinetic floors, arm bands that light up, and confetti. I am still on a high from this concert. This whole experience was a dream come true!"
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"WowowoWOW. This was a show checked off the bucket list for sure!!!
Chris Martin + his fellow band mates are more than musicians. They're true performers. And man, can they put on a show. They care so deeply about their fans experiences. I knew to expect some pyrotechnics and a sick
 light show, but my expectations were far surpassed. The wrists bands were AWESOME. To look out into a sea of color radiating from the audience... Now that was just magical, and I can only imagine how incredible it looked from Coldplay's perspective on stage. 
Everyone seemed to be having a great time! I went with my parents and husband, and was delighted to see how many families - with parents and children of all ages - were also in attendance together. I have never seen my dad so happy or in his element! I was thrilled. The only show"
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"All excellently well, very good organization and one of the best concerts I've ever been in my life, I would see them again."
6/16/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,The guys of Coldplay did not disappoint.  The music was fantastic and the light show being synchronized with each song was the best I‚Äôve ever seen.  The added component of synchronized lights on our wristbands made us feel connected to the band in a special uplifting way.  Loved their performance!  My only complaint is that they ran out of wristbands so we didn‚Äôt all get one.  I‚Äôm glad I got the chance to go!
6/16/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I can't describe how perfect this night was. I had the best nosebleed seats and I'm so happy I did because I was able to experience the full effect of Coldplay on the crowd. It was the most memorable sing along in my adult life.
6/16/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Received a last minute email about $20 tickets. You did not know where the seats would be and had to pick them up at will call. They were uppers with limited view on the side of the stage. That's fine with me as I've seen them many times and really go to hear them. Well what a show they put on. The energy was off the charts and they sound amazing live. The bracelets really add a new dimension and the fireworks completed the atmosphere. They played all the fan favorites along with a few songs from the new album which I really didn't know the words to. Then as a special treat New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen came out for a couple of encore songs with Chris. Needless to say it was a perfect ending to a magical night."
6/15/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The best concert I‚Äôve ever experienced, period. The whole experience was completely immersive, between the amazing wristband lights, the fireworks, confetti, and other visual effects.  The band made amazing efforts to engage the crowd with a local touch through the staging, interaction with individual members of the crowd, narratives from Chris Martin, and even performing their version of the local team‚Äôs fight song with a Coldplay flair.  The performance was impressive and soulful, the crowd was energized and fun, which added up to an amazing experience. Thank you Coldplay for a very memorable rainy Wednesday in Philadelphia!"
6/15/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Completely blown away by the music and the show. A real sensory experience! My friend and I had so many goosebump moments that it was well worth the drive. We got the $20 Infinity tickets - if you are even thinking about it DO IT!  A bunch of Infinity tix holders were seated together at this show and just in awe of the quality of the seats and our good fortune.
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This was one of the best concerts I have ever been to. Coldplay sounded amazing.  We loved the light up wristbands that they handed out- it really enhanced the experience.
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay can put on a show!!! Coldplay has been my favorite band for years and hearing them play a perfect arrangement of old and new songs with such spectacular lights brought me to literal tears..... quite a few times. I also love that they are advocates of such a great cause in going green and saving our planet. The ticket money goes towards the amazing cause. such an amazing group of people and such passionate fans!!
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We had such a fun time at Coldplay. This is my second time seeing them in Atlanta, and both concerts were terrific! They really put on a show."
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This concert was amazing.  I was a little upset about the bag policy, because they enforced it very strictly with the sizes if you were over even half an inch they sent you back... if you don't have a car you have to carry your stuff with you and you need to fit it somewhere.   I think the transparent bag policy was not the best, I am not going to buy a transparent bag only for a concert.  Everything went smoothly with the digital tickets.  I was a little upset that in order to get drinks you had to make a separate line for beer and another one for liquor.  Other than that I was very pleased with everything."
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I was down at the floor level, definitely recommended for this kind of show! Very interactive with the screens and the bracelets and the confetti and the giant globe balls. 10/10!"
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The audio was loud but distorted. It was very hard to understand Maria the Scientist, H.E.R. Was better, but the audio throughout the show was terrible. Even though Coldplay was great."
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"It was my first time at The Mercedes Benz Stadium and it was Amazing!. I‚Äôm totally impressed for how big it is and for the incredible things that you could eat and drink inside, my seats was perfect!. Really a great first time visited!."
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Me and my wife came from NC to watch them in Atlanta and it was one of the most beautiful and amazing concerts we‚Äôve gone to. I am so glad we got to see them live and will definitely be back whenever they announce another US tour!
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I love how they are trying to save the world and i know where my ticket money is going to help clean the environment.
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I haven't been to many concerts in my life but have waited a very long time to see Coldplay and they did not disappoint.  It was the height of showmanship.  I told my wife we need to hop in the car from Atlanta and drive down to Tampa to see them again.  I was also pleasantly surprised by H.E.R. I knew of her but didn't know any her music.  She gave me Alicia Keys vibes, which is very good.  I hope Coldplay puts out another record and tours in the Southeast United States again soon. It's a must see."
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Great show with lots of crowd interaction.  A few less new songs and a few more old ones would have been nice, but I get it.  They didn't play ""Speed of Sound"" or ""Trouble"" which imo should be staples at any performance."
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"If you have never been to a Coldplay concert, stop what you are doing right now and go get tickets!  My boyfriend and I attend a lot of concerts, and while we try to find something special about each one, we couldn't pick just one thing for this show.  Everything about this show was AMAZING!  Coldplay doesn't just put on a show, you get an experience that will have you feeling giddy for a long time.  The lights, the sound, the energy, the interaction, EVERYTHING about this concert was wonderful.  We can't wait to attend another!"
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,One of the best concerts I have ever been to and I have been to alot. Great voices and a fantastic show. They really get the audience involved. They had 3 stages so everyone had a more close up experience. Well done Coldplay!
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Ticket said 7, band started playing about 30 minutes after 2nd warm up band finished, 30 minutes after sundown around 9:15pm
Sound system for warm ups very boomy"
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We had a group of 6 family members who all sat together at the show.  Everything was wonderful, however, I thought the music was too loud before Cold Play went on.  There were a couple of guests before them and it was so loud that people were covering their ears and we were in the nosebleed section.  It wasn't as bad when they came on.  They had an outstanding show."
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay was just AMAZING, what a great concert and great vibe all around. The only thing I didn‚Äôt love was H.E.R, she didn‚Äôt have much interaction with the audience and not everybody knew her songs so I think if you‚Äôre opening you should definitely work with the people who are paying to see you.

Totally incredible concert from Coldplay, we love you!!!!"
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"What a perfect event!! From the venue, the Mercedes Benz arena had very friendly and helpful staff. The roof was opened for Coldplay, very cool as the moon was shining so brightly! To Coldplay, what an awesome show, so much fun! They are so energetic and really engaged the entire audience. LOVED it!!!"
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This was without question the best concert I have ever been to. To see Coldplay play live was a dream come true and boy was it an experience I'll never forget. Chris Martin and the boys have a way of genuinely making you feel appreciated for being there and give 110% effort in delivering a positive and uplifting show. 5 star rating from the venue to the food and drink and the concert!!!
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Was the best concert I have ever attended.  Visual effects were out of this world.  Would attend the concert again if it came back to Atlanta
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"My grandmother and I enjoyed the experience so much! Not only that the concert has full of surprises, it's amazing that everything is eco-friendly!"
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was genuinely the best performance that I have ever seen in my entire lifetime!  What made it even better was that it was my son‚Äôs first concert.  Coldplay exceeded all of my expectations and quite frankly blew my mind!!  I would give this all the stars, but all I have is 5 so, 5 stars!!"
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"A show I will always remember, Mercedes Benz is such an incredible place, enjoyed every detail, food is good and affordable, had a couple beers, room temperature was PERFECT (despite it was a very hot day) and the light show is just mesmerizing! I will definitely loved the overall experience‚Ä¶"
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,COLDPLAY IS THE BEST BAND ever!!!!! THEY GAVE US Exactly what we wanted. They put on the best show ever. I can‚Äôt wait until they come back to Atlanta again so we can see them and have another amazing night with amazing people amazing lights amazing sound amazing love.
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was my second time seeing Coldplay. I can say with certainty that I will never get tired of seeing them. There is just so much positive energy, and the band sounds amazing live."
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Cold Play itself was fantastic, but the acoustics in the Mercedes-Benz Stadium were not. Echo was very prevalent and very hard to understand any lyrics sung or words spoken. Disappointing."
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Coldplay has been on my bucket list, I was pretty excited when they had a show in a nearby state. One thing is, I will never miss a show of theirs again! I have never experience a concert like theirs. I sat pretty high up, nearly the last row, and didn't miss a beat. They are inclusive, they make sure you're aware that your ticket $$ isn't just for them- things like conservation, pollution, recycling. The lights and colors were just beautiful to watch. And wow- they even showed a list of Credits for their stage crew/ staff at the end of their show. It wasn't just another concert, it was a full music and visual experience. Definitely see them on their tour if you can!!"
6/14/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was great, but traffic getting to the venue was a DISASTER. There were no traffic police and  I guess the parking attendants decided to start letting everyone in at the last minute because whatever they were doing wasn‚Äôt helping the flow of traffic. Basically, I stayed 5 minutes from the venue and it took me 45 minutes to get to fedex field because of stand still traffic. So I missed 45 minutes of the show. The LED bracelets were great but I wish they would‚Äôve worked for every song."
6/14/22,FedExField - Landover,"I cannot tell you how much I have taken this group into my heart.  My husband has been a fan from the start but ever since seeing them in Melbourne in 2017 (birthday present for hubby) I have been a little in love with them.  Their music and ‚Äòstage show‚Äô (wristbands) are fabulous, they seem like such lovely human beings and thank their fans after every gig.  Who could ask for more?"
6/14/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Best show ever! The lights, the music,  the balloons,  the energy of Chris Martin and his band! 55,000 people meeting in peace and happiness. It can be done!"
6/14/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I will never not be amazed at the level of show they put on. From start to finish it‚Äôs fin, interactive, enlightening and pure musical joy. Their words, the lights, the fireworks, the level of talent & their environmentally friendly show should be experienced once. I will go every time I am able!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I‚Äôve been to quite a few concerts in the Mercedes Dome-ATL, and have pretty much given up watching future concerts there, due to poor sound quality and high ticket prices‚Ä¶ but Coldplay was phenomenal, and the best show I have experienced there so far‚Ä¶ and I did Floor tickets to Coldplay, Chesney, Rolling Stones and a few others."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The energy during the whole concert was amazing, words can‚Äôt explain it. It definitely one of the best nights ever. Coldplay are such an incredible band, they‚Äôre songs are so beautiful and just each member work so hard to make each concert the best. They have my respect for always helping organizations to help the planet. They deserve everything that‚Äôs good in this world."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I always wanted to see Coldplay and I was celebrating my birthday ü•≥ I couldn‚Äôt think any other way that going to see Coldplay. I have the best experience of my life and the best birthday ever!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Never been to a concert like this. It was an amazing experience. Out of this world fro, Coldplay. It was worth every penny!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I‚Äôm not sure if there are words to describe how wonderful the show was. Had the time of my life and got to see the concert of my dreams. Thank you for the music you share and play for us‚Ä¶
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The absolute most fantastic concert experience I‚Äôve ever had! Like an out of body experience, the production, great mix of old and new songs, light show with the wrist bands was awesome. Everything about it was outstanding. I wish I could attend every single show on this tour, it was that great! Coldplay is the best band in the world!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay was incredible!!! Such a fun concert!! Didn‚Äôt like the Mercedes Benz Arena -way to small for that many people
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Best concert i have ever gone. I felt like i am attending a giant party, interactive and engaging. The ambiance is out of this world, sound is great. And to top it all, there was a surprise guest showed up on the stage and it was Kelly Rowland from Destiny‚Äôs child. Whaaat..??? Ok. Mic dropped !"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We've seen them a few times, but this year's show was the best ever. The sound quality at MB was better than usual. I can only assume it is because the roof was open. I have said many times that there is no current band that is truly ""Rock and Roll"" besides these guys and this show proved that even more. Their vocals and showmanship are unmatched. Another great thing is how much fun they seem to have. I don't know if they are really having that much fun but I hope they are. Thanks for a great show."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,The light show was astonishing and I was absolutely amazed during the whole thing. Even non-Coldplay fans would‚Äôve enjoyed the show!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Like literally outside of my body is what I felt like watching this show. Coldplay has always been a favorite band and I knew we had to see them at some point. Incredibly lucky to have caught them at this exact moment in time. The entertainment value was off the charts. I will be speaking the gospel of Coldplay to whoever will listen for years to come.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"it was a fun and engaging event with coldplay! 
but two things really upset me and left a terrible impression of the event. one was the adherence to such strict rules for the purses: mine was within the measurements, but because the small piping around the purse went over the measurements we had to pay $10 for it to be kept in a locker, all because a security check would've been too difficult to do? and it wasn't just me, but one of my companions as well, even though when we bought our purses we went with a piece of paper with the measurements so we could get something within the guidelines. 
the second thing that upset me was the fact that everyone around us was maskless. now, i know what the cdc guidelines say, but i think it shouldn't be left to personal responsibility whether to be masked or not during what's essentially a superspreader event. i felt absolutely unsafe, even though i was double-masked and have three doses of the covid vaccine. with all these personal precautions, i still came home and tested positive for covid, which will make me miss out on a week of work and therefore lose income. i am Not laying all the blame on the event, as i could've caught it elsewhere, but considering the factors mentioned above and the fact that we were at a place with a capacity of over 70k people, it's not difficult for me to connect the dots. i'd ask for due diligence to protect the people you purport to make money from, but we all know this message will reach absolutely no one."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,All I could ask for and more in a band. So professional in sound and performance making you feel welcome to their music.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay was hands down the best concert I have ever attended!  I am a senior and have attended many, many concerts in my 63 years, but this one blew me away!  Chris Martin and  the band members are all unbelievably talented but even beyond their talent, their humbleness is a breath of fresh air in the our narcissistic society.  I am blessed to have been a spectator of one of the best bands of all times!  Thank you Coldplay, Atlanta and Mercedes Benz Stadium!!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Everything about this venue, the food, the seats, merchandise was planned very well and organized! I am  disabled and in a wheelchair,but it was easy to move around and the security personnel were very accommodating and professional! The concession line was great and the food and drinks were very reasonable in price and tasted very good and was hot and having unlimited refills on soft drinks was amazing! The show was great and the artists phenomenal! Coldplay really lived up to their reputation as Global Citizens by having everything used in the show being sustainable and recycling lots of the technology used in the show, utilizing the open roof to keep the venue cool and the bicycles to charge the tech and equipment used in the show. Well Done and thanks to the Mercedes-Benz stadium staff too!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This concert was everything I wanted it to be plus so much more.  The mix of old and new songs was perfect. The crowd was very engaged.  They have not played in Atlanta in 21 years and they sound just as amazing today. This is not a show to miss!!!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Such a fantastic event. Cold play concert is the best combination of talent , technology and massive collective participation !"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Love the lights love that Chris Martin wanted The fans on Americans to get involved with his songs and saying it was just a beautiful amazing experience I am so happy that I went with the man that I love we both love Coldplay and Chris Martin he is an amazing artist
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I am so glad that I bought these tickets. It was an amazing show and I would tell anyone that is a Coldplay fan to BUY the tickets! You won‚Äôt regret it!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay is awesome! They‚Äôre awesome I. The studio and even better live. This is my second time seeing them and their audio/video for the show is the best. The Mercedes Benz stadium was trash. There was so much echo during the opener that they decided to open the roof. Also, Chris Martin stuttered during a song so I know the echo got to him. This place is terrible for concerts. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend seeing a show here."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The concert experience was very engaging.  The wristbands they give you  are interactive throughout the show and is unlike any other experience you will ever have at a concert.  If you have a chance to go, do not hesitate!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay has been my favorite band ever since I was a child and I had always dreamt of attending one of their concerts. Finally got to see them in ATL this time and every aspect of the concert was magical! I would definitely want to attend another one of their concerts.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The Coldplay concert was amazing from start to finish. HER did a wonderful job transitioning from her soulful songs to songs with a little more ‚Äúrock‚Äù flavor. I‚Äôm sure she gained a few more fans. Coldplay intertwined their musical genius with fantastic showmanship and creative use of lights. I sang, danced, and ohed and awed the entire night. Having Kelly Rowland join for a song was also a nice touch."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I didn‚Äôt think I would ever get the chance to see Coldplay live. Tickets are usually expensive and hard to get not to mention traveling costs as well. My fianc√© and I were able to get our tickets for $80 each in the ‚Äúnosebleed‚Äù section which in my opinion ended up being one of the best seats in the house. You could see the entire layout of the stadium and in turn got the full experience of Coldplays fantastic light display. They really put on a performance that could be enjoyed regardless of where you were seated. I got to hear songs played live I‚Äôve always wanted to hear. It was fantastic
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I‚Äôve been to hundreds of shows and festivals from the stones, to jack white, to LCD sound system, and Coldplay easily is top 3 for me all time! Incredible. Chris Martin is one of a kind!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,We were incredibly impressed with Coldplay and their energy for the entire show.  My wife‚Äôs a huge Coldplay fan and this show was a dream for her.  I am a casual listener and I was thoroughly impressed with how entertaining they were.  Mercedes Stadium is a great place to see a show as well.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We only paid $20 for infinity tickets so we really can‚Äôt complain too much. I thought I would be happy to be anywhere in the stadium but our seats were so high up, to the side of the stage and behind the speakers. The sound was horrible. You could barely tell what songs they were playing. We did enjoy the light show from up there though. Fortunately it wasn‚Äôt our first Coldplay show and the last one we saw was amazing!! Learned my lesson on buying infinity tickets and driving eight hours to get to a show we couldn‚Äôt even hear!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Best performance ever, hands down! I don‚Äôt think you can ever top the experience. Sound, music, lights, and overall genuine presence of a band that is truly having fun and living their dream. It showed. Great venue with fluid traffic flow and amazing organization for that number of people."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay was amazing, the show was spectacular! H.E.R and Mariah did great too! So much energy, the way they connected with the audience was great! An event that is unforgettable! I hope to see them again one day! The stadium was great too! I loved it!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay totally outdone themselves! This was the best concert experience I've had as far as artist goes. Venue...needs improvement on getting where you need to go. I wasn't happy about most of the before..but Coldplay...speechless!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I have been to a lot of concerts this was the best by far! I will never forget it. All types of ppl and races all came together and had a great night!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I would see Coldplay yearly if that was their tour schedule. They put on the best show I have ever seen. I love how sincere they seem and they are always so gracious to their fans.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The concert was the most amazing night!! Insane performances, best songs, cool vibes, and amazing special effects!! I love them so much and it was my 1st concert with them and there was not ont one moment where I was not loving it!! So special ‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you Coldplay, you were aMaZiNg and you did not disappoint!! üíôü§çüíöüß°"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"First the venue was awesome‚Ä¶ Mercedes Benz in Atlanta was full and open and Just a great space. 
COLDPLAY was on point and killed butt. They had a great vibe with the crowd‚Ä¶singing with us and just kicking it. BEST CONCERT OF 2022!!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Wow!!!  Coldplay were absolutely amazing!!  The lights, the fireworks, the sound, the interaction was incredible.  Please tour the south again- ATL, North Florida area!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,it's not a concert. it's a once in a lifetime experience that makes everything going on in the world disappear totally if only for just a few hours. would go 1 million more times if i could. would follow them around the world if i could!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Never a bad show. Worth every penny, and most definitely an experience. Fun, energetic, visually and audibly vibrant. Awesome night"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,First ever Coldplay concert! It was amazing! The wristbands you wear for the extra lights was super fun as well as offering to dance or bike to help power the stage! The music quality was excellent (and loud) The only downside was trying to get an Uber or Lyft ride back to the hotel. They may wanna offer something in the future to make getting a ride a little more easier for travelers/tourists but that isn‚Äôt directly a concert issue I know lol
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"A Coldplay show isn't a concert; it's a full experience. If you ever get the chance to see them, do it! You'll get all the feels and probably a good workout in the process."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Absolutely amazing show! I have been wanting to see them since I was 12 and finally got the chance to. They exceeded my expectations as artists, musicians and humans in general. They have a huge heart and I love that they use their platform to help those in need and for our planet as well üíô Would love to see them again soon!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I waited for two years for Cold Play to come to America, and better to my City of Atlanta. The performance was all that. The sound was perfect, the band was on point, and the interaction with the audience was invigorating. If you love music please see this band."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Probably the best concert we‚Äôve ever attended!  Coldplay put on an amazing show - can‚Äôt imagine it any better.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Doors did not open on time (5:30) so people were standing in the hot sun for an extra LONG time. Once inside (that process was smooth with easy security walk-through detectors and ticket scanning kiosks) the  venue provided excellent food options with wonderful low price-points ($2 popcorn!) Mariah the Scientist impressed with her effortless vocal range and H.E.R. wowed us her range of instruments and talent. At some point as the sun was about to set the roof was opened and we all enjoyed watching an impressive display of modern engineering-and welcomed fresh air. I‚Äôll be honest-I must be getting old to say this-I feel like it was a bit too loud. Especially the openers (do they have to be as loud?) It felt like a volume for an outdoor arena but other than the hole at the top, we were definitely indoors. I saw a lot of people wincing at first. Anyway‚Ä¶around 9:00, just after sundown, Coldplay was introduced by a sweet family (apparently they had sent an email thanking the band for including the hearing impaired and we‚Äôre contacted to do this ü•∞) The band entered and our bracelets we were given at entry started lighting up‚Ä¶amazing! The energy from the crowd was electric. The set was the same as the previous show with the exception of Independent Women with Kelly Rowland. The band stopped singing Sky Full of Stars to ask us to put our phones away and enjoy this one song together, saying that coming to Atlanta felt like Christmas to the band. It was a special energy created-everyone was UP! Overall a terrific set list of old and new. The lights, the confetti, the big screens, the band giving it their ALL for 2 hours‚Ä¶a great show. Chris must have some serious cardio training! My personal highlights were Adventure of a Lifetime, Viva la Vida (the audience singing with them) and Sparks. I love this band dearly so I say with love that the singing of Something Just Like This wearing an alien head doing sign language was puzzling but then topped later by a muppet, yes an actual muppet, singing Biutyful with Chris. No one knew what to do with that. 
So overall definitely worth the money and the 40 minutes getting out of the parking deck at 12:30am. I should note that the line for Uber/Lyft was daunting. Hundreds of people just standing by the curb. Now I must re-watch all my videos and try not to be sad it‚Äôs over."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Best concert I have ever been to! Loved being at the Mercedes Benz stadium it was beautiful! The show was spectacular with Chris Martin being very entertaining and genuinely enjoying himself! I would definitely recommend going to the concert! You will not regret it!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,One of the best concerts I have seen. We were sitting in the second row of the upper deck but felt like we were part of the concert
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Easily one of the best concerts I have ever seen, and I‚Äôve seen a lot of concerts. Coldplay was so much fun to watch and the entire show was an uplifting experience. Chris sounded great, as well as the rest of the band. Coldplay and myself are both huge fans of U2, and I certainly felt their influence on Coldplay‚Äôs show. Just incredible."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,The Coldplay concert in ATL was exceptional!  They put on the best concert I have seen over the years.  The crowd was very much into the show and it made the experience that much better.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,H.E.R. and Coldplay were great!  Loved loved loved the wristbands Coldplay lit up during their performance.  Super cute when the wristbands were yellow during the ‚ÄúYellow‚Äù song.  The 4 star rating is not a reflection of how I felt about Coldplay.  It‚Äôs due to the poor sound quality that I attribute to echoing in the Mercedes Benz Stadium.  Once they opened the roof the sound was much better.  I expected better from a new stadium.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Getting in and out was easy. The venue was well air conditioned. The sound was very good. Coldplay put on an incredible show!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The show was amazing!  The opened dome, lighting, pyrotechnics, wristbands, and ENEGRY made for such a fun concert!  Coldplay played a good combination of newer songs and old favorites. Chris and the band also had great interaction with the crowd. 
The venue was comfortable, clean, easy to walk to, had good food and drink options, and the staff were friendly and helpful - I  would definitely consider traveling to another concert there."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,It was an amazing experience!  One I will treasure always!  I love Coldplay!  The music speaks to my soul!  The special affects made the experience surreal! Thank you Chris and your talented band!  You‚Äôre sharing your gifts and making the world a better place!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I bought tickets for my daughter's birthday.  She is one of H.E.R. biggest fans and she was opening for Coldplay. I told my daughter if she ever had a concert that I could drive to I would take her. Well, I surprised her with tickets. She almost jumped out of her skin when H.E.R walked out on stage. She knows everything about the singer. I wish  she could have met H.E.R. in person backstage or something.  Coldplay was AWESOME also. That was my first time hearing their songs and we loved every moment. It was very interactive and one of the highlights we enjoyed was the singing and the wrist bands. We had an awesome time."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The lights and effects, if possible, were as extraordinary as the music. So many great songs and EVERYBODY knows the lyrics. Chris Martin sang his heart out. Band members were all spectacular. Great charities were supported by everyone's ticket prices. The whole concert was a win-win."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,We loved the show. We knew that we were going to be far away but couldn‚Äôt buy seats closer to the stage. Very expensive. But the sound was very bad at the top of the stadium. Sometimes it was hard to even recognize the songs.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was a great concert and venue. 
The stadium was so easy to navigate and everything was really well managed.
The COLDPLAY concert experience was all that I had hoped for. It‚Äôs really almost a stage show. The band is all so into everything, and then having the light up wristbands you get to be an interactive part of the show as well. 
This was my first concert at a big stadium like this. I wore ear plugs while the ceiling was closed, but once they opened the roof I took them out and it wasn‚Äôt overwhelming even though I‚Äôm a total introvert with sensory issues."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Magical evening with Coldplay! I‚Äôve seen Coldplay now five times and this was by far the best show. They are so entertaining and the energy in the room is over the moon. Love everything about it. Will go see them again‚Ä¶
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Everything was so organized, stadium clean, stadium personal so attentive and nice, and the COLDPLAY concert was just magical!,awesome, a wonderful and unforgettable experience!!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Very entertaining, well put concert! Best concert I've ever been to and that includes a Pink Floyd concert. Will definitely go see them again when they are on tour."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Quite literally the best concert I have ever Attended!  The band was energetic and put their all into the entire show.  Great interaction with the fans and the passion they give make the show!  Mercedes Benz Stadium was a great venue to attend!  Very clean and the most polite and accommodating staff!  I would repeat this night anytime!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay delivered an awesome show with exceptional lighting effects and crowd participation.   Fans were given wristbands upon entering the venue.  These lighted wristbands were synchronized to the music creating the coolest light show.   The opening singer H.E.R. was great and showed off her musical talents on various instruments, playing rap, blues, and soulful ballads.  Coldplay played their hearts out, moving among the stages, giving everyone a show to remember!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"After waiting for years for Coldplay to start a new tour I finally was able to fullfil a life goal :) amazing scenery, lightning. Many great old and new songs. Couldn‚Äôt ask for more and I wish I could relive that night!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Mercedes stadium is an awesome arena and the opened ceiling made Coldplay even more awesome! Coldplay has been on our bucket list for years and this was an awesome way to celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary!! They totally rocked the stage!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Me and my family went to this concert and it was hands down the best one we‚Äôve ever been to. The energy was amazing, they interacted with the crowd. This was the kind of concert that even if you didn‚Äôt know the words, it would still be fun."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Everything went smoothly from ticket buying to parking. The staff at the stadium were friendly and the seats were just as described. AND THE PERFORMANCE WAS PERFECTION. Absolutely the most fun night. I saw Radiohead at the same stadium and it was the worst sound. The Coldplay show was a huge improvement. Best show ever.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,The integration of the crowd into the show and the ability to take Marta and not have to deal with traffic was awesome. Loved the sound and energy of the band.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We were up very high but it didn't matter.  The show as great, sound was great and the light show was great.  I loved that the roof opened before Coldplay - very positive atmosphere and a very pleasant evening."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We love Coldplay!  HOWEVER.....
The sound system at Mercedes Stadium is horrible.  So loud that it was painful and also distorted.  Show itself was fantastic with the lighting and theatrics on stage.  Hopefully when Coldplay comes back to Atlanta they will choose another venue.  Bigger isn't always better."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This tour is truly spectacular. The energy in the stadium was something on another level. My husband and I can not stop talking about it. They really did it to the max.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The concert was wonderful, but I was disappointed that they didn‚Äôt provide us with the LED bracelets when we checked in. After getting seated and discovering we were supposed to have the bracelets they had ran out even though they were aware of the number of attendees."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay gives one of the best shows I've ever seen, if not the BEST. It is entertaining, colorful and energetic! Get ready to end up with your feet hurting and without a voice. BEST BAND EVER!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"It was a absolutely incredible concert, the show, de details, the sound, the staff , fire works , and of course Coldplay was amazing"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I‚Äôve been to 200+ major concerts and this was absolute best live show I‚Äôve ever seen ‚Ä¶ including multiple times seeing U2, Prince, Metallica, Lollapaloozas, Ozzfests, DMB, Oasis, Pearl Jam, Beasties, Tool

Band sounded great, Chris Martin has endless energy, the lights/bracelets we amazing. 

Great setlist, so much crowd interaction ‚Ä¶ just an absolute masterclass on how to bring 50k+ people together into a beautiful night. 

I will 1 million percent go see them again in the future."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay definitely did not disappoint. Finally caught up with them in Atlanta. 2+ hours of full blown energy. Crowd was definitely in to it.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was more than a concert...a total experience with passionate band performance, lights and fireworks. My only comment for improvement is in regards to getting notified of specifics for our VIP tickets (info on what exactly included, time open, gate to use) and stadium requirements regarding bags. t"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,One of the best shows I‚Äôve been to. The thoughtfulness of the group truly came through. Would definitely see them again!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"My seat wasn‚Äôt the greatest, but the experience was top notch!! Coldplay is so good. The wristband lights + music made this the best concert I‚Äôve been to."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay was on my bucket list and I was so excited to get to finally see them. Best concert I've ever seen! However, the only issue was the acoustics. I heard many complaining about this as well. It was hard to understand the artist when they were talking or really hear the songs clearly."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Concert was Amazing, and Coldplay really blew my mind away. On the other hand, Stadium Personel didn't know where anything was located. I got there on time to make it to the VIP Nation Pre-Party, and everyone told me to go to a different place. long story short, I never made it to the Check-in on time to enjoy at least 5 mins of it."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"It was amazing.
I traveled from lima, Peru just for the concert and i loved it. The show si excellent, the stadium is perfect and COLDPLAY y the best band of all.
It was a dream came true"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Perfect seats, incredible band! I‚Äôve been waiting 20 years to see Coldplay and I finally did it! The lights were amazing and made for a magical experience"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I‚Äôve have waited to see Coldplay for years and finally got to see them. It was worth the travel and money to be able to see them so closer to the stage. It was a dream come true and I can‚Äôt wait to get another opportunity to see them again!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This has been, I say, my most grateful experience watching the talent of a concert. It was never boring and it kept us on our feet throughout the whole concert. I really enjoyed it and some of our proceedings when to something good. Very happy. Thank you"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I have seen ColdPlay in concert 3 times now and their shows are unlike any other. They are ABSOLUTELY incredible and no matter where you sit it‚Äôs going to be phenomenal.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"COLDPLAY was a fun concert with a strong feeling of a huge group coming together as one with the band. With all of the negative in the world COLDPLAY let the crowd know for a couple of hours the world can still be beautiful and peaceful with the fun audience help creating the show working together with the bracelets the band provides for a beautiful light show. As Chris said, ""this is like Christmas"", I had turned to my cousin who accompanied me earlier and said the same thing. The seats were good and the crowd seated around us were nice people. The opened roof made it cooler and the fresh air was nice and made it easier and more comfortable to breathe and feel less stifling. Four people other than myself, that I knew was in the building and it was a nice feeling sharing the experience together. COLDPLAY was like when Freddy Mercury used to bring the crowd together with the band to make the show unforgettable. LOVED IT!!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,My top concert bucket list ‚òëÔ∏è. Coldplay's Music of the Spheres was absolutely amazing!  I was literally in tears most of the time. This time with my girls and husband will always be a treasured memory. ‚ù§Ô∏è
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Such a great live band. The show was spectacular. We had GA and arrived early to get a spot close to the stage. I‚Äôve seen the band several times and this was the best tour to date. I had 2 friends with me who were seeing them live for the first time and they were thrilled.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Best concert ever!!! We all LOVE COLDPLAY Everything...the stage, the songs, the attitude, the feeling, the lights, the production, the atmosphere....A1"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"the experience with the band was unforgettable but the line to buy a hot dog and a soft drink was a failure one hour for them to give me food, one person serving so many people"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"It was a wonderful evening . When the concert started, I cried . It catchend me from the first time until to the last second ."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"the confetti, lights, and fireworks were absolutely incredible!! I‚Äôve loved them for so long, this was the first time I was able to see them, and they did not disappoint!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This show was fantastic! Excedded expectations in all aspects! Cannot wait for Coldplay to come back to North America!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I love Coldplay, and still do after attending a disappointing concert at the Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta June 11, 2022. I know they put on a great show, but the venue just is not conducive to concerts. The acoustics are terrible - even when someone was just talking you could barely hear/understand them. We will never go to a concert at this place again - definitely not worth it."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay has long been one of my favorite bands, and they did not disappoint in Altanta. They played all my favorites, and I even got to dance with a stranger to ""Sparks"". What an incredible experience! I'll definitely see them again."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This was an absolutely fabulous show! The set list combined classic favorites and newer songs. The light show produced with wrist bands and lasers was amazing! This was an incredible experience that I‚Äôm still thinking about. And Kelly Rowland showed up to sing an acoustic version of ‚ÄúIndependent Women‚Äù with the band! I wish the US tour wasn‚Äôt over so I could see it again.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We traveled in from Charleston for the Coldplay Concert! We paid a lot for Truist Club tickets and were so excited to go! Our experience with Katarina walking through security was awful to the point we will not return to that venue. I and one of my daughter's had clear bags and my other daughter had a bag that was regulation size. They stopped her because it, according to their card, was 1 centimeter too wide.  We had to send a guest on a scooter back to the hotel, he left, and then they told my other daughter who had a small clear bag that she couldn't move forward after she had already passed inspection! We had to call our guest back on his scooter to pick her bag up as well! Horrible! The Truist Club was wonderful as were all the employees. Coldplay and H.E.R did not disappoint. Too bad it couldn't have been that way at the beginning. Horrible way to start the experience."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay provides outstanding entertainment.  Coldplay loves ATL fans and they love Coldplay.  The Coldplay sound in Mercedes Benz was excellent with the roof open.  This is an exceptional concert experience.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This was not a regular concert this was a once in lifetime experience. I‚Äôm glad I got to share with my 13 healed son. He loved every minute of Coldplay! This is one concert/experience you have see live in your lifetime.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,The best band. The spectacle of lights was perfectly matched with their songs. The sound quality was also great and easy to understand each word. Highly recommended and I wish to have them back soon at Atlanta.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Such an amazing concert! Sound mixing was pretty bad for first two acts (Mariah the scientist and H.E.R) H.E.R is amazing, I‚Äôm so sad that the sound was not great. However, when Coldplay came out. It was mind blowing. Highly recommend seeing Coldplay in concert!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,i‚Äôve been to many concerts this year but none as amazing and breathtaking as COLDPLAY! I saw Coldplay back in 2012 and was amazed then and am even more amazed now. Everyone should experience a Coldplay concert in their lifetime‚ô•Ô∏è
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,2nd best concert i have ever seen and i have been to hundreds of concerts. They were only 2nd to BTS due to BTS choreography.  The atmosphere and audience involvement made for an unforgettable show.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Well Coldplay never disappoints really. This is the first time i had ever seen them in concert though and what a great experience! The crowd, the music, the light interaction with the concert goers. It was all such a positive and emotional experience. And with my all time favorite band doing what they do best...it was magic!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The Mercedes Benz arena is just amazing, and it was the perfect venue for this fantastic group.  Thank you Coldplay for an unforgettable show!  Best concert I have been to.  I would love to see them again!"

6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I go to a lot of live music in many different venues.  This was one of the best shows I‚Äôve ever seen in terms of music, acoustics and techno effects.   I will never forget it."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Loved the LED wristbands and beach balls!  So much fun and gave great energy to the crowd.  Loved the interaction with the crowd.  Loved the message.  Chris Martin is the epitome of joy!!!  So notable that he thanked and appreciated the crews and all of the people who make the show happen...gratefulness.  Yasssss!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I have always dreamed of seeing coldplay, and every part of the concert exceeded my expectations! Definitely a dream come true!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This was the absolute best concert I have ever seen!! Coldplay makes you feel apart of the show with all of the light features. Would defiantly see them again!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I attended the Sphere tour to see H.E.R. She was great. But, COLDPLAY was incredible. The energy in that arena was crazy. Sound was great for an arena concert!! I‚Äôm a true fan now."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,What a show!  It was so fun and entertaining from beginning to end.  I now want to go every time they are nearby.  I urge everyone to do the same.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Club seats, AMG lounge, Roof open at Mercedes-Benz arena. Coldplay at its finest. This is definitely a must see concert. They never disappoint."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I have wanted to see Coldplay for almost 20 years, every time if tried it couldn‚Äôt happen and this tour blew every expectation I had out the water! Hands down the best show I‚Äôve been to in my life"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,An excellent experience overall.  The venue is amazing and the staff worked diligently to get everyone inside and where they needed to be.  Coldplay put on an truly one of a kind experience.

6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,The band sounded fantastic and the performance from Chris Martin was top notch! I will be seeing them anytime they play in my area!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"My first Coldplay concert and it was AMAZING! Great production: lights, sound, and Chris and the guys interacted with the audience and made it feel special! I could tell they really have it their all! And they played SO MANY SONGS"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay was great, they definitely know how to put on a great show, their music is great. The sound, not so much, I don't know if they stadium is just not great for music, but the echo in there as bad, if you didn't know the songs you could not understand what they were saying. I would see Coldplay again, but hopefully in a different location."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"My second Cold Play concert at Met Life!  Loved everything about the experience!  Chris and his band have all this energy which shows in their performance of every song!  Electricity was in the air with the fireworks, lights from the watches, attendees who couldn‚Äôt sit down set the stage for the entire night and let‚Äôs not forget the airplanes flying over us!  Amazing band which made an amazing night possible!"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,This was a truly once and a lifetime concert that was so unique and filled with energy that I believe all ages and demographics would enjoy.
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Sunday, June 5, 2022 Show at MetLife Stadium:
Wow Wow Wow!!! First big stadium tour since pandemic lock downs. I took my family of 4 to see Coldplay. All the big hits with all of the new Spheres awesome songs in full stadium in fabulous weather! We had standing only floor tickets and had plenty of space around us between the end of the long stage and the satellite stage. We were amazingly close to performances on both stage areas. Bruce Springsteen showed up to add to the magic. The stadium crowd was full of energy, singing, doing the wave, and those lighted wrist bands, fireworks, confetti, laser lights, and beach balls were so entertaining. What's not to love! I took this same crew to Coldplay's show in Liberty State Park in August of 2009. Cant wait for the next tour or maybe this tour again... :)"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I‚Äôve been a longtime fan of Coldplay and have always wanted to see them live.

They put on one hell of a show.

The energy in the stadium is unreal and out of this world. The band sounds fantastic live. They pour their love into their shows and send it out into the crowd and the world.

Thank you for the best concert experience I‚Äôve ever had. Looking forward to many more with Coldplay."
6/13/22,FedExField - Landover,"great opening acts.  gave us enough break in between to the real show start.  When Coldplay came out, the fireworks were unexpected.  The energy of the concert from the band to the audience was so lively. I was entertained the whole time.  Vibe of the concert was high the whole time! We had a couple of encore songs! It was fantastic! I can't wait to go again!!"
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Ambianxce was great. Lincoln Financial Field was the perfect place for such a big crowd. Stationary bikes and kinetic floors provided some energy to the stage and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Fireworks and giant spheres made the stage uniquely lively. One of our wristbands didn't work but otherwise everything was perfect!
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This band, their eco causes and support, their music and stage presence, the palpable energy and vibe, the light show, the interactivity of their performance and audience -- ALL WORTH THE HASSLE OF GOING INTO THE CITY! Dancing and singing in the rain has never been so fabulous <3"
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The performance was amazing, the stadium was really bad on organization and to let people in, it wasnt just the parking. They didnt communicate properly where the entrances were. And they did the bag checks and all and then they will say that wasnt your entrance i had my bag checked 3 times and we had to walk around the entire stadium to wait in line for over 30 minutes because they werent checking anyone at some point"
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The lights/sound and playful effects were exceptional. Great and amazing show fireworks, confetti balloons OMG! Like the greatest experience‚Ä¶. My recommendation is that if you are going to their concert choose standing room‚Ä¶"
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The band makes the crowd feel nothing less than greatly appreciated.  The entire show has an energy that you leave with, and the concert never has a dull moment.  Highly recommended."
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Me and my wife took our teenage kids to their first concert. Exceeded expectations. The kids loved it too. The integration with the wristband lights made for a great time. Classic and new songs played made for a hoarse throat and ringing ears.  Just brilliant. Chris‚Äôs integration with the crowd was on point
6/13/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Saw Coldplay once last time around, and this time both in NJ and Philly. The lights, the bracelets with the fireworks. Bruce Springsteen in New Jersey coming out and singing with the band was a awesome moment. Chris Martin singing Eagle fight song and then making up a song on the Fly about Philly just genius. It is an outdoor show so the sound is not perfect, but 60,000 people singing together so many of the Coldplay hits was. In New Jersey loved that there was only aluminum water bottles and aluminum cups for the drinks. Philadelphia there was still plastic, which I was very disappointed with considering the theme of conservation. You really feel like Chris Martin loves performing. His energy doesn't seem to stop and he is an awesome front man, and you can tell he's an awesome human being."
6/13/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"My 11 year old son, wife & I went to see Coldplay. It was an out of body experience. To the extent that every time I play videos from that night, I get teary eyed. The world would be a better place with more Chris Martin's in it. Thank you for providing such positive vibrations to everyone at the stadium.

God bless you :)"
6/13/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I will forever be thinking about this concert. It was truly a dream come true to see Coldplay, and to finally have them a few feet away was absolutely incredible. I can‚Äôt wait to see them again one day, just phenomenal! I really cried."
10/30/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"First concert we‚Äôve attended as a family and had a great time. My husband and I came with our daughters (18 & 24 years old). What struck me was that the audience around us was so culturally diverse yet we all came together to enjoy singing along to the same music. 

Cold Play put in a fabulous show as usual. H.E.R. Is amazingly talented. I was not impressed with the first opening act at all. 

Also I would suggest more merch tables throughout. We were on the third level and had a long walk to get to it. 

The venue was great, we had no issues getting to our seats or leaving the stadium which surprised me as there were 70k fans. 

Overall it was one of the more memorable concerts I‚Äôve been to and would highly recommend a Cold Play concert. I loved the production, light bands, fireworks and just the upbeat diverse community vibe.

I would suggest letting the audience know that the bins for the light bands are at the stadium doors. Many were being tossed into the regular blue recycling bins."
10/17/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This was probably the best concert I‚Äôve ever been to. The energy in the stadium was unlike any other gathering and I heard all of my favorite songs. There were light up bracelets that we took on our way in and I felt like I was a part of every song when it lit up multicolors! I love how they moved their stage closer to the back at the end so everyone felt like they had an equal opportunity to see Coldplay up close. So many environmentally friendly practices were in place and the confetti was a nice memorabilia I got to take home with me. Truly fantastic, definitely a must-see show everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime."
10/7/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"It was a wonderful experience‚ô•Ô∏è colorful, a very good vibe, positive and a great message to take care of our planet, and if we want to be loved, we have to be love! 
I am ready for their next tour!"
10/6/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Overall the show was amazing, great effects, lights, the showmanship and dynamic between Chris and the public was energic. Just great!"
10/6/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Not a fan of coldplay but I can say is worth your money and time going to see them love. The show is full of energy and the light show is amazing
10/5/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,memorable experience coldplay rock ou of the stadium and full of joy fireworks and production was amazing not to mention the quality of sound. The only thing that I submit is they had only one ticket office available so I had to walk too far to reach the southwest ticket office available to claim my tickets. everything else was amazing !
10/5/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,I am from mexico and i always want to experience a concert coldplay and see he was talking in spanich some words it means a lot for me becausr he knos we where in la frontera and living this experience with all the show but mostly was the messege he brouth us the love the sustentability to help the world amaizing i want a be part of this proyect any concert defenitly i will be there. Love coldplay
11/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Music of the Spheres 2023 at Lumen field / Seattle, WA. was  AMAZING  AS ALWAYS! I've been to 5 Coldplay concerts now and they just get better. 
I see alot of concerts of diffrent bands and honestly Coldplay puts on the BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN! WONT MISS A 
COLDPLAY CONCERT!! THANK YOU COLDPLAY FOR ALL YOU DO!!!!!!!!!!"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Concert was awesome.  Coldplay never disappoints. The Rose bowl/Pasadena shuttle system for transportation (taxi,uber,etc) was horrible. No one giving directions,  mass of people from all directions filtering into an almost single file. People going around the line. They drop you off in a parking lot again with no directions.   If this is the best they can do, I would avoid this venue."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,We were supposed to go to their show in 2021 but we‚Äôre postponed and then later cancelled. But when I say they were worth the wait. It was definitely the best concert I‚Äôve been to. They made it all interactive and the excitement levels were perfect to keep you entertained throughout.
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The concert was amazing however when it finished it was a chaos!!!! The organization was good but at the end not at all, a long and crazy line to take the shuttle"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay was great! Ticketmaster purchasing was surprisingly smooth amidst all the negative press. I got my tickets on the first try and barcodes were delivered before the event. Tickets were saved offline to my phones wallet and entry was as simple as ‚Äútapping‚Äù on a contactless reader.  

Overall the organization was great as well. My only flaw would be that gates opened later than advertised (but not by much. Maybe 15 mins)"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay was great! I've seen them now 3 times and always great.  The Rose Bowl was the worst part by far!  No one to direct to get into the bowl itself.  I bought parking in advance and got there early. Was directed to lot H even though I was shown Lot F on the map when I bought it. (Yes, I saw the disclaimer that there's no guarantee which lot, but Lots F & G were not even that full.) So parking was easy, but... to get in to the venue, the line was OUT of the parking area and stayed that way for hours!!!  Food lines once in, were just as bad.  After the concert, the main gate was closed so after walking around to get closer to where Lot H was, we were told it was closed and no one knew why.  There should have been people at he tunnels directing you where to go if the main gate was closed.  I've been to other big concerts there, i.e. Taylor Swifts Revolution, where it was sold out as well. Not even close to this chaos.  Whoever was in charge of coordinating these things should be FIRED.  I'll never go to another concert there."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Waited too long to be let into the stadium. 3 hour wait (standing). When did finally opened the doors, everyone rushed in. No control by the staff, very disorganized."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The concert was truely great. Beautiful music with beautiful people in a stunning venue.
Only issue with venue is the access in and out. They should consider having offsite parking for everyone and shutting people In via a tram or a bus. 
In case of emergency, it's like a death trap at rose bowl."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"One of the best concerts I‚Äôve ever been to in my 66 yearsüòú Wildly entertaining, amazing music from the opening acts to the headliner. Sound, displays and special effects were top notch. My only criticism is that the Rosebowl is kind of a nightmare to park and sit! Off site park was easy, shuttle moved quickly. Great, great concert!!"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Honestly hands down the best concert I‚Äôve ever gone to! It was a great experience! Will definitely be going to another concert of them!
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I flew all the way from Puerto Rico to see Coldplay live at the Rose Bowl. Was it worth it? YES, I would do it a million times again. Coldplay was in my bucket and would recommend to anyone looking for a nostalgic night."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The concert was fun and very entertaining. Coldplay interacted with the fans and it did not disappoint! First time I see them live and will be going again hopefully next time they come to socal
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"My wife and I have never attended such a wonderfully, Illuminated atmosphere with great music supporting it. This was an amazing concert!"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"If you've never seen Coldplay, now is your chance!!! It has been one of the best concerts I've been and can honestly say it was worth every penny."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Best concert ever! Really involved with the crowd. Beautiful show & loved the renewable energy they used for the lights and the wrist bands !!! Was so fun ‚Ä¶ love you Coldplay
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The Coldplay show at the rose bowl was amazing. I am a big Coldplay fan so probably a bit biased but I definitely enjoyed myself!!
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Best and Most Entertaining Concert!!!!!! Chris Martin and Coldplay totally rocked iy! So fun, so amazing, so entertaining!"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"One of the best shows I've ever seen, hands down. Coldplay was phenomenal. The sound in the stadium was excellent.
Leaving the rose bowl is a complete nightmare. I blame the event staff. Not the individuals at the event, the management who hasn't come up with proper exit protocols. We parked off site and took the shuttle in. After the show, trying to get back to the shuttle was a complete fail. No signage. Just a long line of people who have no idea what's happening other than the line. After 1 hr in that line seeing no improvement, we walked (err hiked) back to the off site parking. On the road by 12:10am. The show ended at 1040pm. So that park sucked. 
Now, if I had the opportunity to see Coldplay again knowing the parking/exiting situation would be identical? I'd take the tickets. That's how great the show was!"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The Coldplay concert on October 1, 2023 at The Rose Bowl was one of the best concerts I‚Äôve ever been to. The musicians really put in üíØ into their show and everyone could feel it. That part was an amazing experience.
The organization of the Rose Bowl was the opposite. One of the worst experiences I‚Äôve ever had.. worse even than having to deal with the parking at the Hollywood Bowl. I‚Äôm ok with having to take a shuttle to and from the venue to the Parsons Parking Structure‚Ä¶ but I got in line to take the shuttle after the concert with hundreds of other people, only to be told after 45 minutes that we were waiting in the wrong place‚Ä¶.(I had asked and everyone in line said they were waiting for the shuttle so I thought that was the line but it wasn‚Äôt). So after standing on my feet for four hours for the concert I had to walk for what felt like at least a mile and a half just to take the shuttle back to my car? And it was a cold night so we were all freezing even though we had sweaters. But it was the lack of organization. I went to get a hot dog and Diet Coke and they said that none of the diet cokes or coke zeros were working at the concession stand. The employees are a bit harsh and brusque. Not happy with spending almost 400 dollars for the concert and then the Rose Bowl almost ruining it for us. The concert itself was amazing and magical thanks to Coldplay.
Do better Rose Bowl‚Ä¶ please üôèüèº"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Never disappoints. They turn the magic on! Everyone dances. Everyone Stands. Such love in the crowed and the band is so personable, likeable and perfection on the stage, Plus You know every song and so does everyone there! ***Amazing Day! truly."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Best concert ever! Visuals and band performance were beyond. Parking situation at Rose Bowl was not bad at all. It was kid friendly too. All Coldplay concerts are just WOW
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,I waiting 20 years just to go see Coldplay live.. and was amazing !!! Best night of my life and can‚Äôt. Wait for them come back and see them live again cause they are truly are amazing performers
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Started out slow, then H.E.R. Came on then Coldplay. They really put on a great show. Definitely will see them next opportunity. The whole light up wrist bands were great also. Chris Martin is such a positive influence in this world."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The Coldplay concert was amazing! It felt like an immersive experience with the wristbands lighting up and the fireworks. I felt very free being there and I really enjoyed how the concert tried to run on ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy. Chris Martin and the rest of Coldplay are the best! I can‚Äôt wait to go to another concert.
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Chris Martin is not of this world‚Ä¶ he embodies pure joy on stage and is a marvel to hear live. Even if you‚Äôre not a Coldplay fan, see them at least once!"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay and H.E.R. were phenomenal, but the logistics of getting into the Rose Bowl Arena were an absolute disaster. No signage, no help from anyone with a uniform, 90 minutes just to get in on foot after parking (with $75 prepaid parking).  NO BUENO GUYS!!

Was Coldplay worth it? Absolutely. But for what I paid, Ticketmaster needs to do better!! NOT okay."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Concert itself was soooo great! The Rose Bowl was HORRIBLE! No direction given to guests, security was a complete joke, not safe at all. Mark my words that there will be a tragedy at that stadium sooner or later. The whole thing needs to be bulldozed and rebuilt."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Perhaps it was the sheer fact that this was an interactive concert, perhaps it was the familiarity of the songs that illustrate the most difficult period of my life, perhaps it was the incredible energy that Chris Martin had... the truth is that this concert is was the most incredible, heartfelt performance by not only Coldplay, but by the entire stadium.  Thank you!  Thank you for connecting 68,000 people through music on October 1, 2023 in Pasadena, California."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"It's Coldplay.  They're amazing.  The sound, the audience engagement, the authenticity, the inclusion across the board.  Inspiring night all around."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Parking and entry was a breeze. But the hard liquor option sucks. It‚Äôs one vodka choice on tap. You can‚Äôt even see what‚Äôs going into your drink. And it‚Äôs blue so our lips turned blue. Lame.
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Amazing does not begin to cover it. Coldplay is one of the best bands out there and their concerts never disappoint. We flew from the east coast to the west coast just to see them and it was worth every penny and every bit of our time. Planning on going to Europe to see them next. Yeah! they're THAT good!
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I already had high hopes for this concert before attending it. But then ACTUALLY experiencing it, it EXCEEDED the expectations I had laid out. This was one of the best concerts I have ever attended. YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE A COLDPLAY CONCERT AT LEAST ONCE IN YOUR LIFE. 10000000000/10 THANK YOU CHRIS AND EVERY BODY ON HIS TEAM WHO MADE THE EXPERIENCE SO WONDERFUL FOR ME AND IM GUESSING THE OTHER 68,000+ PEOPLE"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Absolutely amazing! One of the best concert that I've been to. Everyone should at least go to a Coldplay concert to get the best experience ever! Would love to relive it all over again!
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay puts on such a great show.  They have amazing positive energy, sound amazing live and give 200% every show.  Such a pleasure and honor to see them!"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This was my 3rd time seeing Coldplay and they never disappoint.  What a fantastic show including ALL of the effects.  They are by far my favorite band and I cannot wait to see them again!
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"love every minute of the night... even the long line for the shuttle back home. great concert, I can do it all over again... thanks COLDPLAY"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"This is the second time we've seen Coldplay at the Rose bowl and it was incredible!! This band is in my top 5 of bands to see love!! Chris Martin is an amazing performer and I'll see him and the band over, and over."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The concert energy was amazing. Coldplay didn't disappoint and really had you in the moment. Would definitely see them again!
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"What a joyful experience. Coldplay‚Äôs music alone is uplifting and inspirational, but attending the concert elevated my soul to a type of conscious nirvana. Chris Martin warmth and kindness is palpable even in a stadium filled with60k+ people. Singing in unison, taking in the collective human spirit woven together by the light we shared was hands down one of the most beautiful experiences with music I have ever had. AMAZING!!!"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay is a magical concert experience that everyone should have at least once in their lifetime. I have loved this band for many years and it was my first time seeing them live. They were amazing! I was captivated the entire time. They make every person in the audience feel connected and part of the experience.
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Just when you thought Coldplay can't outdo themselves from the last tour, they exceed all expectations. You just have to go to one of their concerts to see why they are just soooo great live!! Do yourself a favor.... go see them and be happy!!!"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I have been waiting to see Coldplay for ages , missed them last time around. Finally went to see them at Rosebowl last Saturday‚Ä¶amazing! It was such a great experience and the atmosphere was electric. Chris Martin held the crowd in his hands and we were eating it up! The sound was fantastic and how could anyone not love 2 and a half hours of greatest hits by Coldplay! Truly an awesome performance and experience. Thanks"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The security line was easy to get through, the hardest part was standing in a very unorganized line to receive a wristband for floor ticket holders . The line blended in with all the vendor lines and was poorly maintained so people were cutting in line. It took us 45 minutes to finally get the wristband and the tunnel entry on my ticket was not consistent with the designated tunnel the day of the event. My suggestion would be to have a designated entry gate for floor ticket holders only, that way when their ticket is scanned, they also receive their wristband, creating an efficient entry system."
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"coldplay never fails to put on an amazing show. I have been to so many concerts & still nothing tops the shows coldplay puts on, truly magical and just perfect I can't even put into words. The only bad experience i had was the crazy ridiculous prices Ticketmaster offers, they really are the true scalpers"
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Enjoyed every second of the show! I never stopped singing! I really appreciated the thoughtfulness of every detail and I love the steps they are taking to offset the carbon footprint the show has!
10/4/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay put on a great show as always!! They had a nice selection of songs. My husband and I really had a wonderful time! It was nice to finally be able to see them after the tour being postponed due to the pandemic. If you‚Äôre a fan , you should really see them live! I also really enjoyed H.E.R. who opened for them. I wasn‚Äôt familiar with her but am now a fan!"
10/4/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Although my feet ended up completely destroyed, it was so worth it! I bought floor tickets and was standing (and jumping and dancing) for around 6 hours but I didn't even feel them. They put on one of the best shows I've ever seen live, the way they interact with the crowd is so wholesome, and also (one of the many reasons I am a huge fan of theirs) what they stand for is heartwarming. It hits you all at once, when you're screaming your heart out to songs that heal, to songs that hug you, you can feel that every second.

I highly recommend everyone to go at least once, because on top of all that, the lights and props make the show so fun! Thank you, Coldplay, for everything!"
10/4/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This is a show you must see at least once in a lifetime. Chris and the band make the whole experience very meaningful and with the purpose of giving back - from the light up, recyclable wristbands that everyone in the crowd gets to wear, to your ticket purchase going towards the One Tree Planted organization. The band plays all their classic hits, acoustic versions of some of their older songs, and delivers the entire new album as well. Their love of performing is evident with the energy they bring to the stage and they sound anything but incredible live. Make the trip to see these guys light up the stage- you won't regret it."
10/4/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Everybody should attend a Coldplay concert in their lifetime. Best experience ever. Amazing band, best energy and great entertainment. Still feeling the vibe of that day. Amazing!"
10/3/23,BC Place - Vancouver,"The tickets for this event were expensive. However, Coldplay is phenomenal. HER was amazing and being on the floor really excited me."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Besides the great music the feature of the interactive bracelets putting on their own light show in concert with the music was a new twist to a love show for me and I thought that was just great! Made us feel truly a part of the overall experience!!!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The.Coldplay Concert was one in a million. Chris, Jonny, Will and Guy performed incredibly amazing . All sounded so good . The show was definitely a performance that all should see!!!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,I could not recommend this show enough - I‚Äôve been to over 30 concerts and this one was by far the best. It‚Äôs a full immersive and memorable experience that you‚Äôll never forget!!!!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I thought the Coldplay concert at Soldier Field was the best concert in their last tour, but their concert at the Rose Bowl was even better- on a whole other level!!!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay really outdid themselves with their Music of the Spheres tour.  Production value was super high, not to mention their outstanding musicianship.  The LED wristbands they gave everyone at the concert added such a unique and fun light design element to the show.  We had a fantastic time and felt so inspired and uplifted.  We can't wait for the next concert!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"What an amazing show!! Loved every minute of it. Can‚Äôt wait for the next concert, but will watch from somewhere else. Rose Bowl venue is terrible. We stood in line an hour before the gates opened. It took another 1hr 45 mins to get in. The restrooms were out of toilet paper before the concert even started. It took us another 2 hours to get out of the parking lot. They were totally under staffed."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay is one of my favorite bands of all time and I have been following them since they came out in 1999. I have been to 5 of their shows and out of every concert, show, festival, rave, live musical event, they are hands down the best performance I have ever seen. PERIOD!! Not only are their songs so AMAZING and touch your soul, they have a variety of sound and songs that have meaning with nostalgia as they evolved over the years. Their performance is also very engaging with the audience, which makes them stand out from any other artist of any genre since you FEEL their music and witness the magic of their performance live with the wrist band lights given to all audience members, the playful nature of the spheres bouncing around the stadium, and the beautiful energy around us! It is definitely more of an experience that you get to be a part of instead of just watching your favorite artist perform on stage.. you get to be a part of the show and they interact with you! I will continue to go to every show they have when they tour in my area of Los Angeles until I die! LOL I hope they come to California again since I just can't get enough of them and their music!! Only Love! <3"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I have been to a lot of concerts. Seen some amazing artist. Coldplay is definitely top two concerts I have ever been to. It was beyond amazing. Very magical. Spiritual. Peace! I love all of their songs, I knew all of their songs. I was singing at the top of my lungs. At first the we kind of lacked energy as a crowd. Coldplay really turned that around. I really loved the fireworks and the interaction with fans. The wristbands and the lights. The balloons. The spheres. Amazingly beautiful üíö 10 out of 10. Would recommend. H.E.R blew me away. She played the acoustic guitar. The electric guitar. The drums, and the piano. Her singing is soulful and top notch. She matches Coldplay vibe. She was perfect."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The show was an ABSOLUTE DREAM as always. This was my 3rd show and they never cease to amaze me. I definitely recommend getting floor tickets at least once to experience true Coldplay fashion. But they are just as good seeing all the fun from a distance. Does the standing suck? Yeah.. you‚Äôll be sore. But you‚Äôll have memories that will last a lifetime. It‚Äôs more than worth it. If you want to see Coldplay live? Do it!!!!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay you never disappoint. AMAZING concert ‚Ä¶ loved every minute of it minus the venue/parking! Can y‚Äôall choose a different venue next time?
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay always puts on a great show but their stadium concerts are amazing. Definitely a must attend concert at least once
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Performance was awesome  dissbut the Rose Bowl disappoints be making everyone wait outside until 5:20 pm.  Gates should have been open an hour earlier.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The wristbands were awesome. Chris Martin is such a great performer. Overall, a great show!! Didn‚Äôt love the opening acts, though."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I have now seen Coldplays last two world tours. The light wristbands, fireworks, and lighting special effects set them apart from other bands. The fans also make the show and seeing 60k people stand and jump in lighting systems that go with the music is amazing simply amazed and amused."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay never disappoints and Rose Bowl one of the best outdoor concert venues! Hope they play again in the States in 2024!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"There are not enough stars to rate a Coldplay show.  Their Rose Bowl shows were spectacular in every way!  Not a bad seat in the house! Class act thru and thru!  From their musical abilities to the fireworks, confetti and wristbands to the overall feeling of joy one experiences at a Coldplay show, they serve up an unforgettable night of entertainment!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay was amazing as usual. Chris really loves to get everyone involved in the show, it feels like one big family. Coldplay fans are the best!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I've been to lots of concerts, and this tour easily topped all of them. It was truly magical, the energy was really positive. Chris Martin engaged the whole crowd and everyone participated. I even shed a few tears and that's never happened before. The light up wristbands just added to the experience making it look beautiful and also made you feel part of the show. Well done guys! I knew it was going to be a good show, but it far exceeded my expectations!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"First and foremost, Coldplay is amazingly awesome and I will go anywhere to see them again, with the exception of the Rosebowl.
Their shuttle bus wait was over 1.5 hours long!
Horrible horrible experience!
Second, when I pay to see a band as epic as Coldplay, they need, and should have, played for more than two hours! We had to wait two years for them to reschedule, and two opening acts is absolutely NOT NEEDED."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay show was something else, just magnificent. The night was fulfilled with love, Magic and beauty of life. For two ours it felt like there‚Äôs nothing bad in this world, only love and peace. THANK YOU COLDPLAY!!!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I have been waiting four years for this show!! It was worth the wait!!!
I have been a fan since 2009 when I attended their show at the Home Depot Center in Carson California. I have had the good fortune to see them multiple times since but really wanted to take my son. He flew from CT to join me and it was epic!  The music, the color, the lights, the immersive communal experience, the charismatic enthusiasm of Chris Martin and this band mates. Watching the genuine joy they still feel making music together and sharing it with the audience!  They have always been my favorite band!!  They did not disappoint and it was my favorite concert because I shared it with my son!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay show was something else!!! Absolutely magnificent. The night was fulfilled with love, magic, Coldplay was and is something else."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I'm so happy that I bought Coldplay tickets! Yes, was it very expensive, but I had an amazing time. The concert was lengthy just because of openers then the main performance, but each performance was pretty great. And when Coldplay came on stage the atmosphere in the stadium was insane. Each song was wonderfully performed, the songs were amazing and even sounded better in person which is pretty rare, and Chris Martin/bandmates were very hyped. The only bummer was that my ""glow up wristband""never worked. Everyone else around me had theirs glowing, but mine came broken which was disappointing since I wanted to be apart of the wristband gang haha. I ended up sharing the wristband with my concert buddy. But overall I had an amazing time, and the concert went by so quickly and I never wanted it to end."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Operational logistic nightmare. Line that combined into lines with no guide or direction. Going into the venue and leaving the venue adds a couple of hours.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"One of the best concerts I‚Äôve ever been to. The merch was great, got a shirt that was dedicated to that 2 night show in the venue."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,I‚Äôve been to almost 200 concerts. This one made it to the top 3 as soon as it begun. No words can describe the experience. You have to live it yourself!!! #VivaLaVida
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The entrance to the venue, the line to get the wristbands for the floor and the line for the merch were a nightmare. There was no signs to indicate almost anything. You asked the crew and they were usually clueless . I know it is a gigantic task to manage so many people but it felt like everyone was just there just to get over for the day.  Music was amazing and the concert felt short because it was perfect."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"This is one of those concerts where you're gonna have fun whether you enjoy the music or not. It doesn't matter the age, language, you're going to have fun. If you can go, I'd totally recommend it. It's such a beautiful experience and they're so energetic it's just such a happy environment."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The Coldplay concert was phenomenal even with the rain and the fact that 60,000 people attended. The wait  to get out of the venue parking lot was extremely long. The traffic was backed up and not moving at all. The main problem though is the fact that the seats at the Rose Bowl, leave no room for anyone‚Äôs knees. The seats are extremely tight and people tend to get up and down a lot and it‚Äôs hard to maneuver in and out of the aisles but the show itself was fantastic. Chris Martin is a true showman."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The concert was amazing! The experience and everything was unreal! It was banger after banger every time. The bracelet they give to people for the concert was also pleasant and really set the mood for the concert!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay 100% amazing . Rose bowl stadium was the worst place ever!!!! will NEVER EVER go to a concert at this venue,"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay was beyond amazing!! üé∂‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm their biggest fan! However, The Rose Bowl Venue experience was the worst I‚Äôve ever had! I saw Coldplay there back in 2016, but this time sadly was in complete chaos!! No type of organization in place, there were people pushing and shoving so hard that I felt my breath being pushed right out of me thinking that I was going to die!! This has to be fixed or someone could actually die and that would be tragic!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I‚Äôve been a fan of Coldplay for as long as I can remember growing up listening to them, but never had the opportunity to see them live until they came by this year for their MOTS Tour.
Let me just say that I have seen countless of their live performances online and had always hoped they would be just as amazing in person as I had seen them on YouTube and they did not in any way disappoint!! 
Seriously after 20 some odd years of doing this you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd slow down or maybe not ‚Äúdo it up‚Äù as much as they used to but honestly if anything, they have achieved just the opposite. Chris kills it every time and moves like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. He is truly an amazing performer because he really makes you feel special, whether you‚Äôve seen him once or a hundred times, each concert feels very personalized and intimate as if this was the last concert he‚Äôd ever do again. 
If you were on the fence about going to see them or even if you are just a casual fan please do yourself a favor and just go see them. I personally got just behind the barricade floor seating and it was amazing but I‚Äôve had friends be seated practically a mile away and say it was just as magical and impactful. Seriously, no matter where you sit you feel like they‚Äôre performing FOR YOU. 
10/10 would highly recommend. 
Thank you Coldplay!!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This is my 6th time going to a Coldplay concert and every time I get impacted of how talented they are! Can‚Äôt wait for my 7th show!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay is always amazing but it‚Äôs the last I‚Äôll ever go to the rose bowl for an event . Worst stadium ever . From start to finish . The parking , the food , the vendors sucks , the way the lines were set up was a joke . To walk was a joke .  We waited in line 2hrs for a funnel cake . And when we finally got it they have no forks or napkins . The concert hadn‚Äôt even started ."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Awesome concert! Best concert I've seen. Enjoyed all the visuals (lights, fireworks), multiple stages, screens, sustainability. But most of all,  the music was exceptional. 
Only downside was the venue.  Would've preferred SoFi.  I try to avoid events at The Rose Bowl. Entrance/exit into stadium and parking is terrible. Took over an hour (got in line @5pm for 630pm show) to get into stadium, line was incredibly long with people cutting in at entrance.  Took us over an hour waiting in our car to get out.
Coldplay made up for the venue frustrations. They were unbelievable!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,It was my first big concert and it was the best. My boyfriend and I had a blast and Coldplay really know how to put on a show!! It was such an amazing thing to experience 10/10
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Wow, I was expecting this to be a great concert though was blown away. Fireworks, the light show through the wristbands, the amazing music, how great a performer Chris Martin is, all of it. Coldplay is good people, they are a band that you want to hang out and have a beer with. Not pretentious, just great and talented and not letting that get to their heads. I'm a way bigger fan now than before."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,I really loved the experience!!! Coldplay was absolutely spectacular and it was a great experience!! I wish we kept the light up wristbands
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"We came to see them again after an amazing show a few years back. This one does not even compare. Something seemed to be lacking. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was the subpar sound system, the un-Coldplay-like production or something else. The show seemed to be short - maybe because of the rain delay? HER‚Äôs set made it up though. She was phenomenal. We enjoyed her performance a lot."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The was by far one of the most extraordinary concerts I have ever been to. The show they put was amazing ! Seeing the planets orbit the floor seat amazing first time I‚Äôve ever seen Coldplay and will definitely be attending any future shows
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The show was 10/10/10. It was nonstop magic, music, and emotions. Such a phenomenal production and inclusive and diverse space. I cannot say enough good things about this night."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay's music alone is amazing but add the armband special lighting around the stadium, the other lights, fireworks and other special effects, it just added even more to make the experience more heartfelt and memorable!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Even though the night was rainy and cold that didn‚Äôt stopped us from enjoying the concert singing and dance all night 
Was one of the best concert I ever seen the performance was incredible and the sound and lighting was great
The only thing negative experience in my opinion was trying to get in at the beginning because it was super unorganized and was very difficult to know where was the line, cause everyone was all over the place even though we arrive early"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay put on the most amazing show! Light up bracelets were synched with the music and made the audience feel a part of the show.  Great energy, Chris Martin has a great sense of humor, just an overall emotional (in a good way) and spectacular experience! Fireworks were an added bonus :)"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Hands down, the best concert I've been to. And I've been to a lot of them!

The organization was a little underwhelming: I would have expected the Rose Bowl at being better at handling large crowds of people but getting there at the indicated 4:30 PM I was met by a sea of people standing in lines as far as the eye could see. No one had any idea where the lines ended and in fact some of them went in full circles. Once inside, it was packed solid but worst of all was the return trip, with another hour-long wait for the shuttles. The band and the show, exceeded all expectations."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Awesome!!! Coldplay put on an amazing show. Had a great time. Venue parking wasn‚Äôt that great and it started raining so we all got wet. Overall great show.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Concert in general was great, but the lines for merchandise and getting wristbands were a bit disorganized. Everyone was cutting the lines and no one was really mandating anything. But Coldplay was awesome!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I love me some Coldplay!  they're one of the best bands in the world, and I have been their fan forever and ever.  But please do NOT HAVE THE CONCERT AT THIS VENUE ANYMORE!  It's too darn difficult to get in, to get out, the bathrooms are too small for women, and the seats are metal benches which was not explained when I bought them.  I understand that you like it because it allows for fireworks etc, but it is such a royal pain in the behind to visit that it makes it stressful."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay concerts are always so much fun! Really hard to beat Coldplay for concert experience. We always feel pure joy watching them perform! 

Entry to the venue was very smooth and quick. But once we got inside, the long merch lines jammed up the whole area with the entrances right across and the food lines. It was chaos! We could barely move. 

Also exiting the venue was bottlenecked as there were smaller exits. Not sure why they didn‚Äôt open up more exits after the show. 

The food quality is also not great at the venue but that‚Äôs probably the same at all venues. Try to eat before for better quality food. 

All that aside, I would definitely see Coldplay again and any other artist at the Rose Bowl. It was a Great concert experience!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Amazing!! One of the best nights of my life. Such amazing performers.  Everyone needs to experience a Coldplay concert once in their lives.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay had an amazing show with spectacular a/v effects including fireworks.  Their entire view on inclusivity and sustainability is to be admired. 
The Rosebowl venue is tired and old and they need to implement better crowd control not just for convenience but for safety. Getting out of the venue was scary and took forever. Lines for shuttles were unacceptably long.  We also were among many made to walk up hill 2.5 miles to get an Uber or private car service on unsafe roads   Took two hours to get our shuttle after getting inaccurate information fr numerous staff on how to get picked up.  Never returning. EVER"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay put on such a great and energetic show with all their hits, some more intimate songs, and a mesmerizing number of fireworks. I also loved the inspiring message that the whole show was about - believing in love. It was absolutely worth the wait after our last cancelled show, can‚Äôt wait to go to another one someday."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I have seen Coldplay at venues across LA far and wide, big places, small places and their shows are always incredible.  I can tell you for this particular show that the seat map at purchase versus what I actually got sucked.  The angle from the map and the angle of the stage did not line up correctly and I got a very obscured angle of the stage.  

Buyer beware a bit.  Again, GREAT SHOW.  They are terrific and I will see them again, but this was not a great experience and I guess its easy to blame Ticketmaster for not coordinating that right with the stage set up when you sell tickets 9-10 months in advance."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The concert was AWESOME. 
Leaving the stadium was horrible. No uber/lyft available. Had to take the stadium shuttle. The line was so long it took 2 hours to catch one plus another 30 minutes to finally get a uber/lyft after the shuttle dropped us off. Took us 2 hours and a half from the stadium to our hotel which was only 9 miles away. 

Overall, I loved the show! But the hassle to get out which took longer than the actual concert made my experience a lot less memorable."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Band was awesome. Venue at the Rose Bowl totally sucks. I wish I had seen them at Sofi or anywhere else. Bench sitting at the Rose Bowl is great for college kids but we grow out of it as we get older. I will never go to the Rose Bowl again for an event. I would drive to another city to see them.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay put on a great show. The venue at the Rose Bowl was not a good place as the traffic was terrible getting there and leaving. There was a 30 minute wait for bathrooms and food vendors.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The show itself was incredible. No issue there. The Rose Bowl overall? Terrible. Parking, getting into the stadium, lack of crowd control, and concessions were all disappointing. Not to mention it takes almost two hours to exit the ‚Äúparking lot.‚Äù I‚Äôd love to see Coldplay again but not if it means going back to the Rose Bowl."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"We arrived early because getting to the Rose Bowl can be very difficult.  The gates opened at 5, but the lines to get in were UNREAL!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"My sister, brother-in-law, and I took a trip to California from Indiana to see Coldplay on my birthday last year but it was canceled.üòû  I would like to celebrate Barbra's birthday too, so can't blame anyone. New duet coming soon?!!üòâ 

Love üíó them enough to try again and am SOOOO happy we did!!! I just can't get enough of that love and joy they bring, they are truly a gift to the world. üåé  Also appreciate that they care and give back so much to important issues.

H.E.R. will be selling out arenas by herself very soon, unbelievable talent!  üé∏ üéπ ü•Å üé§ üï∂ 

Thank you Rosebowl Stadiumüåπ üèü for all of the warnings about parking and traffic, you weren't kidding!

They say it never rains in southern California ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The concert was perfect, the lights, the music, the sound, 10/10. The only thing that was an actual issue was that the Venue was super unorganized with parking and seating."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I was in line for Coldplay concert, and the waiting area needs improvement. Needs more steel crowd control fences we couldn‚Äôt even tell where the line began even the security guards couldn‚Äôt tell and the area needs to be paved, it started raining and we were waiting in line in the mud for hours we couldn‚Äôt even sit on the ground. One good thing is that there were restrooms meters away from the line so good job for that."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay knows how to make us feel good, see the brighter side of the world, and urge us to do something worthwhile."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay has been one of favorite bands of all time, and they never disappoint!  The music, the lights! The fireworks! Everything makes you feel part of the show, it‚Äôs an out of world experience, I will always attend whenever possible ! I‚Äôve been to two concerts and I felt like experiencing everything new again,every hit song they sang brought a memory, which is what their music does and why I love them so much, overall I had such an amazing time!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The Good: H.E.R. and Coldplay put on an AMAZING show.

The Bad: The Rose Bowl as a venue. We, along with 60,000 fans, arrived a few minutes prior to doors opening at 5pm. There was no crowd control. Doors did not open at 5pm. It took us over an hour to get into the venue once the doors did open. People began rushing the gates. Food lines were over an hour and ran out of food before the second opening act. We left before the last song to attempt to get onto the shuttle. Then after the show, there was no crowd control for the line to get onto the shuttle. We ended up walking back to the hotel as it would have taken us at least 2 hours to get onto the shuttle. I would never go to a concert at the Rose Bowl again."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Except for how long it took to get to the concert and how REALLY long it took to get back to the car by shuttle (2.5 hours!) the concert was fabulous. FIREWORKS! BALLOONS! LIGHTUP WRISTBANDS! I can't exclaim enough!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay is such an amazing band, I can honestly say this was the best show I have ever seen and I‚Äôve been to many shows! It was my first time experiencing the bliss that is Coldplay. If you haven‚Äôt been to their show yet, do yourself a favor and buy those tickets!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Although it gets extremely hectic at the rose bowl... the lines and waiting are sooooo worth it!! This was the 3rd time I see them live and they always exceed my expectations.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay couldn‚Äôt have put on a better performance however the Rose Bowl certainly could have! Most of the Alcohol ran out by 7pm, except beer, Club Soda ran out within the first hour. Line to enter the stadium and lack of signage explaining what to do and where to go was zilch. Just when you think it‚Äôs going to fine as you exit after an amazing performance, only to find another line wrapping around the stadium which took another hour or more to get through, in order to take the mandatory shuttle to another place (MILES AWAY from the stadium) to hail a ride share car.  It was pathetic! God forbid there has been any handicapped or emergency situations! Next time choose a better venue, or better yet, Rose Bowl‚Ä¶ STEP-UP YOUR GAME, this your first concert, you‚Äôd think they know how to handle crowds like this!!!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Cold Play was phenomenal!!  Rose bowl parking was a nightmare.  They had tons of staff directing traffic before the show and no one after, not to mention only one gate open!!  It was a free for all with cars everywhere going nowhere.  It took over one hour sitting in same position until a second gate was opened.  Still took another 45 minutes to get out.  I will never go to rose bowl for anything again.  COLD PLAY was absolutely amazing show."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The amount of time put into the planning and execution of this performance is inspiring.  From phenomenal opening acts to jumping on a floor for energy, the lights, the fireworks, the confetti, all were just icing on the cake compared to the visuals on screen and stage and of course, the glorious music.

Avoid the Rosebowl at all costs.  We packed on a golf course with no marks and walked for 2 hours looking for a car.  Once found, there were no direct routes off the course."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay really has changed the game on how a concert should be. Incredible set, lights, interaction, mood, activities wow what a concert!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I am 23 and have been going to concerts since I was 12 to all sorts of genres and shows. By far, Coldplay has been the most out-of-body and completely unreal experience. Coldplay is seriously a show that should be on everyone‚Äôs bucket list. I‚Äôm not even being dramatic. The money of tickets goes toward reforestation, conservation, and other urgent ecological issues, and their show production is environmentally conscious. The bracelets that light up during the show are synced to the music and are made of compostable material. If I am considering to splurge money on any concert in the future, it would be for Coldplay to support them as well as support the causes/organizations that they help fund. Best band ever. I LOVE COLDPLAY!!!!! Their show made me cry out of happiness. Thank you Rose Bowl too, wonderful venue."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,ü§©What a night üé∏‚ö°Ô∏èüé∏Been waiting a long time to see Coldplay and they were fantastic and made the night soo much fun!!! I‚Äôll never forget this night with my husband who gave this as a birthday gift üíù Love you Coldplay! Carry on üé∂üíú
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay at the Rose Bowl, besides all the hassles of the venue, is a concert experience like no other. The energy, overall feelings of love and pure enjoyment of life are unsurpassed by any other act out there. The best every time. They always get better and deliver."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Truly an amazing night.  It was an intimate experience along with 65,000 people. Their music brings us together from different countries, ages and life styles! Truly a BEAUTIFUL Show. We are anticipating their next tour."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay was fantastic when they were on stage & loved how they moved around so more people saw them. It was a super long day tho as we were told to get there by 4:30p. So we got there by 4p and they came out abt 9p and played for less than 2 hrs. I think after waiting so long it would have been nice if they played a lil longer. However the songs they performed were great and overall it was a wonderful day!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,I don‚Äôt even know what to say .. I weeped I danced I laughed I felt connected to everyone around me .. I‚Äôve never been to a concert that produced so much love . It actually changes something inside you ! Chris Martin is an incredible frontman who feels more like a friend on stage. The bands chemistry is so strong and pure. The visual show is spectacular.. just go .. just go
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay knows how to put on an amazing show. I loved every moment of it. I can‚Äôt wait to see them again. Only con were all the long lines at the Rose Bowl.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The show was AMAZING! Coldplay puts on one of the BEST concerts I‚Äôve ever experienced! So if you‚Äôve never seen them, GO!!! 

UNLESS it‚Äôs at the Rose Bowl! This venue has to be one of the most unorganized venues I‚Äôve ever been to. And I‚Äôve been to most venues in the Los Angeles area. The rideshare drop off area was confusing and they herd everyone in like cattle at the entrance. The drink situation was terrible. They ran out of a lot of stuff early on and it took me an hour to get a drink. The line wasn‚Äôt long, the staff was just slow. But the biggest problem the Rose Bowl seems to have is their exit system. They would not allow rideshare out of the venue and forced you to either walk or use the shuttle (unless you parked, which I heard was also a nightmare.) There is only one shuttle line and it goes on for what seems like an eternity. We actually left the show during the last song in hopes of beating the shuttle madness (we had a terrible shuttle experience last time we saw Coldplay there) but it didn‚Äôt matter. We still waited almost 2 hours in line just to get on the shuttle! It was pretty defeating. I absolutely love Coldplay but I‚Äôd never see them at the Rose Bowl again."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"We followed the instructions sent out saying to show up early or you may miss the show. We showed up at 3:30pm for the evening concert. We then stood in line for two and a half hours  to get in the venue. Once in the venue we stood in line for over an hour to get the floor ticket wristbands. We got into the actual show halfway through the first act. Thankfully Coldplay was amazing and made us forget about how lousy the Rose Bowl was. Then when the show was over it took almost two hours to get out of the parking lot. Then another hour to get to the freeway. There is zero organization with the lines, the entry, the exit. Just chaos. This is not a place to hold an event. Just horrible."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Nothing short of amazing! Their engagement with the crowd and all the lights was just an amazing experience. Best concert I‚Äôve ever been to.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The five stars is for the Coldplay performance only.

The Good - Coldplay. Phenomenal performers. Great stage presence. Encouraged audience participation. Great acoustics, video, pyrotechnics, etc. Incredible music and stage set-up. The RF wrist bands created a light show unlike any other. Over the past 40 years, I have been to > 60 concerts in various venues. This was by far the best I have ever experienced.

The Bad - Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena is a natural disaster. Arrival was a nightmare. We abandoned the Uber a mile away and walked. Entry into the event was chaotic and disorganized. Signage was poor. Communication was non-existent. Lines for food and bathrooms were absurd. Leaving was even more chaotic and disorganized. We walked two miles back to our hotel, as riding the shuttle was dangerous.

The Ugly - People have become inconsiderate, obnoxious, abrasive, and entitlement pigs. No fun being in a large crowd gathering anymore. What a shame."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I suppose it was pretty much what I should have expected from a huge stadium concert, but it really fell flat.  Traffic into the Rose Bowl was awful (We Uber-ed).  Traffic through security was similarly rough, though they processed everyone quickly.  We watched the end of HER who played multiple cover songs (really?!) to get the crowd behind her.  Coldplay came on, played for 1 hour and maybe 20 minutes, before departing for the forced ""encore.""They pretty much played every conservative hit to the crowd's delight and only sprinkled in Charlie Brown and a few lesser known songs.  Everyone sang along for pretty much every song.  Is that cool?  Sort of.  Does it take away from the band's and Chris Martin's performance?  Well, yeah.  The energy in the stadium was great, but the whole experience fell flat.  I could have stayed at home and watched YouTube and set similar memories.  Leaving was a chore with shuttle lines that took over an hour.

I don't know.  I want more out of a concert.  I want to feel the band's energy.  I want to believe I'm experiencing a unique moment.  It all felt scripted and kind of on autopilot.  I love Coldplay and their collection of amazing music, but I won't go back to a stadium performance and be disappointed like this.  Perhaps they're simply too big and too popular to do their live music justice."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The concert was great but the food & shuttle bus lines were way too long. Trying to walk to our seats was very difficult as the food lines blocked the way. The food line was allso 1 hr long & the shuttle bus line was 30-45 mins long. Won't be attending another event at the Rose Bowl due to this.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This was my second time seeing Coldplay at the same venue (Rose Bowl) 7 years apart. The music was amazing. I paid a substantial amount for my tickets and ended up not being able to sit because the seats were numbered so close to each other the guy next to me was totally occupying my seat. And the price I paid for parking was annoyingly high.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay is the best in the business for putting on a live show! The energy is really unmatched to anything else. Chris Martin know show to hold a massive crowd in the palm of his hands. The venue concession stands and line formation could have definitely used some organization. It was total chaos just to walk through anywhere! maybe a rope line in the future for better flow of crowds. Hands down the best show I've been to!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Was Amazing! The best concert I attended in my life. Is like magic! Lifetime experience, I can not wait until the next tour!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I‚Äôve attended a lot of concerts in my life. This was hands down the best. The energy, the songs and the production were WOW. 

One request, please never at the Rose Bowl again. Worst venue."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The most Magical night in my life. Colplay made me feel like a roller coaster of emotions in just one night. I'm ready for the next coldplay tour.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I rarely leave reviews, but this concert was so amazing, I felt I had an obligation to let everyone know. The wrist bands that they gave out made the concert a truly immersive experience. Everywhere you looked you could see 60,000 lights flowing with the music. The music was wonderful, as I expected, but they also took the time to involve the audience. They paused at one point to read the signs of the fans and they even invited one concert goer onstage to sing with them. My favorite part was when the asked everyone to put down their phones so they could just be in the moment and experience it. It almost made me emotional. As I have to say is well done, Coldplay. I‚Äôve been to a lot of concerts and nothing could top this one. If you get a chance to see this band, please do. You won‚Äôt regret it!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This is the best concert i ever attended! I took my 7 and 11 years old and they had the best experience ever! We enjoyed it and had so much fun! Love it!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The show overall was just life-changing and so beautifully done by Coldplay that I will remember it forever!! I would say the only reason I give it a 4/5 stars was the poor traffic control before and after the show in terms of how congested the area was; especially with how much people were cutting in lines!  But of course in terms of the performance; it was perfect and more than I anticipated for! I loved the amount of energy the fellow concert goers had as well; they were like best friends to me and my GF the whole time we were at the show!!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay has been on my bucket list and it was the most incredible concert I‚Äôve ever seen. The energy was amazing and Chris‚Äôs voice sounded perfect! The interactive light show with the crowd was engaging. I will see them 1 million times if I can.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The positive energy, feeling, and visual presentation-- plus, the MUSIC! Total package. Brought our kids for their first concert and they--all of us--were blown away. Lines all over Rose Bowl were SUPER long, but I'd go see Coldplay again in a heartbeat."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The Rose Bowl is the worst experience imaginable for a concert - the traffic and parking is unbearable. We thought it would be worth it to see Coldplay - our favorite band. We‚Äôve been to many Coldplay shows and have loved them all except this one. It was way too short and uninspired. They seemed tired and disinterested. Incredibly disappointing. Will not waste the money to see them again
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews but this concert was so amazing, I felt I had an obligation to let everyone know. The wrist bands that were given out to everyone made the concert an immersive experience. In every direction you could see 60,000 beautiful lights that flowed with the music. The music was amazing, as I would expect, but the band did a wonderful job getting the audience involved too. They even took a pause to read the signs that people brought and they invited a concert goer onstage to sing with them. I loved the part where they asked everyone to put down their phones for one song so we all could be in the moment and truly experience it. It almost made me emotional. I‚Äôve been to so many concerts in my life and I don‚Äôt know if anything could top this! All I gotta say is well done, Coldplay! If you get a chance to see this band, please do. You won‚Äôt regret it!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I‚Äôve seen Coldplay live at the Rose Bowl three times and once in San Diego. I want to lie and tell everyone the show was terrible and not go go so that I have a better chance to get decently priced seats. 

Chris has an energy that is unmatched by any artist, except maybe Taylor. I will be anxiously awaiting their return to LA and have even started contemplating traveling abroad for their shows next summer."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Amazing show from start to finish, jumping up and down with the crowd in the floor section, fireworks and confetti. Just positivity all around!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Stunning performance! Such amazing vocal/ musical talent and spectacular visual effects! Chris Martin bring such a high energy that you can‚Äôt help but dance along with him.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Best concert ever! Hands down . My daughters and I had a wonderful experience, it was like a wonderful dream you don‚Äôt want to wake up from . Coldplay releases magical energy through their music and their show. Worth the 1 year wait!
We love Coldplay !"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"You can always count on Coldplay to provide an absolutely breathtaking experience!!! The fireworks, the lights, the music. The whole package!!! However the event organisers have a lot of work to do‚Ä¶ Getting to the arena with the shuttle was extremely smooth. However, after getting there trying to figure out how to get in and where to stand was an absolute nightmare but the worst was yet to come. Post show, it was a madhouse! No idea where to go and everyone just left stranded. We ended up WALKING an hour and when I say walking I mean a trek up and down the hill to get to a spot where we could Uber from. It was honestly pathetic and shocking and was a dampener to an otherwise incredible night! Do better Rosebowl!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Such a great performance! Always a good time. Second time seeing them at the Rose Bowl and both times were amazing.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Bought these tickets for my wife , she loves the band but I  had a great time the experience was great . The Coldplay fans are some of the happiest chill people you can encounter. Great concert!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay gave an excellent performance, from start to end it was full of energy. Rain or shine attending the concert was worth it."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I mean it is Coldplay so it is going to be great. But it was amazing. 
The audio, the video, the extras. It was awesome. 
It was my 11yr son‚Äôs first Coldplay concert and glad he got to experience at the Rose Bowl.  We travelled from Toronto for the show!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay was fabulous as always but the Rose Bowl venue was a terrible experience. Long lines, they ran out of wine before the show started, and the process for leaving the venue was completely disorganized and frustrating to say the least!  Wish I hadn‚Äôt traveled 3,000 miles for the experience!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The concert was amazing, but the ingress and egress systems of the rose bowl are absolutely atrocious. Took us 2 hours from the end of the concert to be out of the parking structure our car was in. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd go back to the rose bowl for Jesus Christ himself."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay concerts are phenomenal and one of a kind. I‚Äôve never been to any other concert with such diversity in age and race. Probably one of the most upbeat and fun concerts you can go to. I also love that Coldplay is environmentally conscious and gives back to the community. Only negative, Rosebowl parking is terrible."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The most amazing concert I‚Äôve ever been to! Coldplay was awesome. The lights just pushed it over the top. I had the greatest time!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The Coldplay show at the Rose Bowl. The band and the show was wonderful. Coldplay‚Äôs show was one of the best I‚Äôve seen and I would recommend everyone to go see one of their shows. I would love to go to another of their concerts‚Ä¶ however, I will never go to another event at the Rose Bowl. This Venue is the absolute worst place I‚Äôve ever been. The parking is absolutely terrible and the crew they hire to run it are nothing but children who don‚Äôt know what they are doing. If the parking situation wasn‚Äôt bad enough Getting into the stadium is itself another line that is completely out of control. The vendors inside are no different. Having the merchandise booths in the stadium made it unsafe with the congestion that the lines made at those many stands. This also created a hostile atmosphere to even try to get to a food vendor or the bathrooms. The Rose Bowl Sucks and the city of Pasadena sucks for not understanding how to organize an event. It was like this was the first time the Rose Bowl ever had an event. Never again will I go to the Rose Bowl."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Five stars ‚≠êÔ∏è to Coldplay for their visual and musical masterpiece of a concert - filled with impressive interactive and over-the-top spectacular surprises. üé∂ üéÜ They create a casual and comfortable atmosphere. The Rose Bowl üåπüèüÔ∏è has challenges with accommodating massive crowds.  Hoped for more smooth sailing and seamlessness. Two hours for entering and exiting a venue is too long.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The concert was great with lots of audience interaction, made the night exciting and fun for all, even under a brief rain shower.

LED wristbands and fireworks were memorable."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,A COLDPLAY concert is hard to put into words. Being surrounded by all the love and joy and positivity just transcends anything words can describe!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,all in all the concert was great but brhnd the scenes it seemed unirgsnozed this year. noone was directing us ehere to go. lines literally wrapped around the parking lots to get in. merch & food ran shoet theres no enough shelter when it rained. when in did people ended up running in the tunnels but staff got upset. people started pushing each other. one ended up in a fist fight. same goes when exiting the place. theres only 1 stairs to let rows of people out. safety wise im not a fan. but the performance was great. cant wait to see them again
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Well I‚Äôm not usually a big fan of stadium shows, Coldplay certainly helped change my mind about them. They put on a great concert, with wonderful effects. The sound was incredible and a big screen to help with close up shots. One of the best concerts I have been to. Hats off to you Coldplay, job well done!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,What nice again Coldplay put on an incredibly spectacular show! Chris Martin is a true entertainer and obviously loves what he does. Such talented artists and I really felt honored to be part of such powerful musical event. Bringing Christina up on stage for her birthday serenade was a class act and was absolutely beautiful to watch. Thanks Coldplay and look forward to the next tour if you‚Äôre up for it!
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay concert is probably the best concert I‚Äôve been to. They get everyone involved. I would not mind taking my kids to this as well. Very entertaining. Only bad part of this is the venue they chose to perform at. Rose Bowl sucks! This place to get in and out of is ridiculous. I will not attend a concert here
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay performed amazingly with the mesmerizing technicolor wonder. Even though it rained a bit, the performance went off without a hitch. The only negative aspect was the venue. Rose Bowl is a terrible venue. Every time, we get burned by the same lack of organization, parking, shuttle, ride share debacle. It took us over 2.5 hours to leave the venue."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The band and the design team said let's do what we have always dreamed of doing and they succeed.  They incorporated so much in this incredible show from light to sustainability from characters to incorporated culture and languages.  There was something for everyone. This did not include the incredible music. My favorite was People of the Pride.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Such an incredible show from beginning to end. Coldplay was awesome; high energy--great GREAT visuals---the lights in the audience rival any other show I've been to. Confetti cannons; fireworks; synchronized lights and tons of positive and loving energy. Love this band. Excellent show! 

Rose Bowl was a CLUSTER to leave and get on the shuttle line. Though we exited right at the shuttles from the stadium we had to walk to the very opposite end of the parking lot to get on a line that had been exponentially growing in the time it took us to get there. It was a LOT and took over an hour to get on the shuttle."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I've been attending concerts for over 40 years.  I've seen some of the greatest bands of all time.  But, I've never been to a show like the one Coldplay put on at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena CA.  Spectacular!  Fan inclusive.  Lighting was extravagant.  Every song had you standing and dancing and singing.  MUST SEE!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The tittle says it all. The concert was a great experience but lines was not organized. No signs which side you were lining up. The lines were all over the place.  No staff near to help.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"First off, the concert itself was hands down, the best concert I‚Äôve been to. The band was great, interaction with the crowd was great. Far exceeded my expectations. The downside of the concert experience at the Rose Bowl was the venue itself. Total lack of communication between venue employees as to where will call and availability of will call tickets, parking was by far the worst experience of my life. Took 2 1/2 hours to get out of the parking lot after the show because there weren‚Äôt any (or enough) parking lot and traffic control employees present to help disperse the crowd. The shortage of food after only  1 1/2 hrs at some food stands and the prices charged for the quantity of food was ridiculous. It was clear to me that the Rose Bowl was not ready for the amount of people that attended this concert. It‚Äôs no secret that Cold Play draws the largest number of fans wherever they play and it wasn‚Äôt like this concert was just added to the tour two weeks ago. I will never go back to the Rose Bowl for another concert again"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Even with the rain and early arrival it was another memorable experience seeing Coldplay. Second time seeing them at the rose bowl wish it was a longer set lol! They have toooo many hits. Monique was the best she helped my husband and I get seats to accommodate his needs.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"We loved the Coldplay concert.  The band is absolutely amazing and their show was colorful and spectacular!   Chris Martin is a gracious, grateful, humble, engaging, and joyful lead singer which draws a great diverse crowd of music lovers together for an uplifting, positive, and joyful concert experience!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"One of the bestest concert exprience.  The rains made it more memorable :) Thank you Chris, Guym Jonny and Will.  You're so amazing!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Absolutely loved the concert!!! Coldplay rocked it! The venue however was a struggle. It was such a mission to leave the venue and very disorganized
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"A show where you sing and dance the entire time!! Best fireworks, confetti , fan interaction!! A must see !!! Coldplay never disappoints!!!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay was incredible, easily the best live performance we've ever seen.  They performed for two hours straight.  The vibe and energy of the crowd was intense; everyone was dancing, singing, laughing - not an empty seat in sight.  It was like being transported to some other place without hatred, racism, bigotry, prejudices.  It was peace and love and it was like the entire stadium became one.  They did such a good job..  Oh, and the bracelets were unreal!  In a world full of hate, it was quite emotional to find something like this, something full of love!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay puts on a good show but under two hours is a joke, especially for the price of admission. They have the material to go longer and left out some hits. Oh well."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"It was an amazing concert, 10/10 experience. Would highly recommend it, Coldplay never disappoints, it was a concert i was looking forward to since the summer of 2021 and it was just an amazing concert overall!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Epic. Nothing shy of pure magic.  The performance has been distilled into a unique experience carefully crafted to have such beautiful interaction and punch its out of a movie.
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Magical. Absolutely amazing, engaging. Best concert I have ever attended in my life. I would go again in a heartbeat."
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Amazing production, so much thought put into this show. Very eco friendly and had positive messages. LOVE!!! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"From the show start to the end, it was full of emotions, great sound, excellent light effects. Musicians were giving themselves to the crowd! amazing"
10/3/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay puts on the BEST concerts.  You can see the passion for music when Chris is performing.  The lights and fireworks are spectacular.  H.E.R. was an awesome performer as well.  Such talent.  Can't wait until they all come to town again!
10/3/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Okayish performance compared to previous concerts I have attended. The wristbands lights were for a very short time and not very good.
10/3/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,My hubby & I had a blast seeing Coldplay for the first time at Snapdragon stadium in San Diego Sept 28!  They were humble and put on a fantastic show!  So glad we didn‚Äôt miss this opportunity to see them so close to home.  LOVE COLDPLAY!!!
10/3/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Absolutely loved the concert! Loved all the songs played by Chris. I just felt the sound system was not at par with their previous concert in San Diego. Also for a few songs the wrist band (lighting effect) was not turned on (like for Viva la Vida). Not sure if that was intentional but would have loved more lighting around that song.
Overall great experience just a few things here and there that could have been better. Also i am not entirely sure but looks like Chris ended it a little earlier than what I expected."
10/3/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay TOTALLY brought the energy, enthusiasm, fun, and connection with the crowd. But unlike the other three Coldplay shows I've attended in the past, this one was different. Being on the floor was a disaster what with all of the constant video taping by other concert goers around me. I am only 5'11"", and I couldn't see most of the show due to the perpetual video taping of every song by everyone around me. I will not plan to be on the floor at a Cold play performance again in the future. Why can't folks just be in the moment and enjoy the music and the crowd with their own eyes instead of through the screen of their phones?"
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It was so engaging that I felt like it was more of a personal experience than a crowd of almost 70,000! Loved the way it brought us closer to everyone around us and made us want to be better people."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay was amazing!! Had such a great time, they played a wide variety of songs and really incorporated the fans well!"
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay's live performances are nothing short of spectacular. Their concerts are a visual and auditory feast, with stunning visuals, vibrant light displays, and Chris Martin's infectious energy captivating audiences worldwide. The band's ability to connect with their fans on such an intimate level, creating an atmosphere of unity and collective euphoria, is a testament to their genuine love for their craft.

Coldplay's enchanting melodies and thought-provoking lyrics will undoubtedly leave you craving for more.

Truly one of the beat shows I have seen!"
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I saw their concert in 2016 in Rose Bowl Pasadena, I think it was much better that time. I expected more this time or at least for it to be different."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I have never seen HER perform in person and I thought she was just beautiful, talented and inspirational. I had no idea she played so many instruments! 

And then Coldplay! just WOW!! from the wrist bracelets that lit up the stadium, the balls the audience played with, fireworks, to the outstanding music and performance - Coldplay didn't disappoint and I had a blast!! worth every penny! And I was impressed that so many young people were in attendance and that Coldplay still resonated with so many different genres of people after all these years! 

The Snapdragon stadium gets A+ for their help exchanging our tickets to the ADA section for our guest who was handicapped. It was so easy! Thank you!"
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The Coldplay concert was magical. All the lights combined with the crowds energy was amazing. They put on such an incredible experience.
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The concert itself was Amazing!  The VIP seats were awful.  People who bought other seats were crowding the bottom of the stands.  Never again will I be purchasing seats like these.  Totally not worth the money spent.
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"If there‚Äôs anything that could beat this experience? It‚Äôd be another Coldplay live show. They leave their soul on stage, connect with fans, protect the planet, raise awareness about social justice, and definitely do their magic to make the show a lifetime experience. What a combo! It was absolute paradise. I considered the show like my 50th Bday party since I could not celebrate it because I‚Äôd recently lost my mom. I had the bestest time of my life. My sign didn‚Äôt catch Chris‚Äô attention so I could join them on stage, but that was OK, I wanted the show to last forever."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The show was amazing, we love these guys!!! We got into the Venue smoothly and it is very nice, the food and drink options were great. The one thing we could see an improvement on would be exiting the Venue, we were at the very back of the parking and it felt like their was no movement for an hour. It seemed that there should have been another route to exit from."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay was AMAZING! The whole atmosphere of everything. I liked how a free trolly ride was optional. Getting into the concert was a breeze, did not have any issues when it came to getting into the stadium and leaving. Definitely would see Coldplay again, there concert is something I feel everyone should have the opportunity to see."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"From the music, choreographed wristband lights, and audience participation to Chris Martin's obvious love for his fans and his craft - absolutely one of the best live performances I've seen."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,We celebrated our 30th anniversary at this concert. It was over the top! Every song was beautiful! They are so talented and put on an awesome show. We love Coldplay and would recommend their music to everyone.
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Coldplay put on a stunning visual concert.  The wristbands made the experience immersive and the show was spectacular.  The new album started off the show and set the tone for the thousands in attendance to experience a great communal celebration of this world.  There was a clear message that we all need to be part of the solution.
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay at Snap(rape)Dragon Stadium was OK. We were pretty far up in the stands. They seemed to pump in a lot of their music. The music meshed in together with all songs. My fav was Clocks.
How can security let you walk through the metal detectors with a phone in your hand, then let you keep walking, what if I had a gun in my boot? Security should be much tighter."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The venue was awesome!  The concert was amazing!  By far the best concert I‚Äôve ever been to!  I was very impressed.  Love Coldplay and what they stand for.  They really have it together!  Chris Martin is great!  Can‚Äôt wait to go to another one of their concerts!
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This was my third Coldplay show and I LOVED IT!  It was so good, I‚Äôm still listening to the playlist. I‚Äôm still walking on cloud nine.  Please come back sooner than 5 years."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This is more than a concert. It is an experience. Coldplay has remastered what it means to be at a concert. Performing among massive, sold out crowds, Coldplay ensures every minute you are there watching them is filled with joy, entertainment, and love. Additionally, they have made significant efforts to reduce the carbon footprint through recycling programs and reusable energy efforts. The only negative is every concert you see after this one will never measure up."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"It was the best concert of my life, Coldplay it's my favorite band since 14 years old, but I'm so sad because my wristband didn't turn on."
10/2/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"They are the best band in the whole world, their show is completely amazing, this show is a must in your life even if you are not a fan"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Seeing Coldplay live will always be an experience I'll never forget. I wated to see them back in 2017 when they came to SD (I live in Tijuana), but I could not afford to buy tickets. So, in 2021 I was finally able to buy tickets for L.A., but sadly it was cancelled. Before they cancelled, I was still trying to figure out how I was going to get there since I didn't have a driver's license, so the way I saw it was ""Ok, it's fine. They knew you needed to get your life together still, so they're giving you some time and I bet when they release new dates it will be in SD instead, and it'll be better for you, it'll be closer"". And that's what happened: I got my driver's license, car and they announced new dates for SD, which made me think, ""That's how wholesome they are! THANK YOU!"". And just as I expected, it was worth every single day. Their shows are really out of this world."
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The Coldplay concert was nothing short of a spectacular experience. As the music filled the air, the audience became an enchanting spectacle themselves, thanks to the synchronized light-up wristbands that accompanied the performance. It was an unforgettable, immersive journey that left an indelible mark.

Coldplay's ability to involve the crowd was a testament to their showmanship. With each iconic hit, the entire arena transformed into a massive choir, singing in unison. The energy in the venue was electrifying, and it felt like a collective celebration of their timeless music.

This show was a testament to Coldplay's status as one of the world's greatest live bands. Their passion and connection with the audience were palpable throughout the night. The anticipation for the next opportunity to witness such a remarkable performance is already building ‚Äì I can't wait to see them again."
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Went with my 17 yr old son- love bands that span generations! Such a fun show, what an iconic band performance! The light show was fantastic, energy was high, and interaction with the audience was so fun! Chris Martin provided an unparalleled engagement opportunity to a couple up on stage in addition to keeping a promise from last year of having someone singing a song with him on stage! Just so cool to see the guys in person. Would 100% go again if I get the opportunity. And of course I could listen to Chris Martin's voice any time!!"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,This is the second time seeing Coldplay‚Äôs Music of the Spheres. Both times I traveled out of state to be a part of this magical musical experience! I don‚Äôt think I can ever get bored or tired of seeing this band perform live. Shout out to Snapdragon Stadium! Great venue!
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I had the best time ever. The atmosphere/vibe was amazing! If you have not already seen Coldplay, you absolutely need to!!"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Fabulous concert experience as always with Coldplay ‚ú®Music of the Spheres World Tour was filled with amazing energy, giant colorful balloon globes, a sea of confetti and shared voices from around the world! Incredible! Thank you, Coldplay üåéü©∑‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöü©µüíôüíú #ColdplaySanDiego"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The Coldplay concert was one of the best I have ever attended. Loved the use of multiple stages and the continuous light show throughout the concert.  The music was excellent!  The venue access was poor.  The traffic between the access highway and the stadium parking was a free for all with little to no police or traffic controllers.  The constant cutting in traffic lines made it impossible to exit off of highway I-15 on to Friers Rd.  I will not attend another concert at Snapdragon until they learn to manage their access to the stadium. It took 1 1/2 hours to exit the highway and get to the parking lot.
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay never disappoints in my opinion, I have been following the MOTSWT since they started and was excited to see them and have the same experience all Coldplay fans were having. Thank you for giving us the best of You!"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"2nd time seeing Coldplay and as usual they did not disappoint! It‚Äôs always such a pleasure seeing the guys and it‚Äôs always such a joyful occasion. With HER being their front act as well it was like you paid for 2 of the best artist in 1. Me as an ARMY as well, them performing My Universe with BTS on the big screen makes all Coldplay/BTS ARMY heart happy! Thank you Coldplay for such an AWESOME show!"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay rocked Qualcomm in 2017, six years later they brought down the house again!  Such a good show.  Coldplay really knows how to make their fans included and entertained!!  Best part was the fake on Sky Full of Stars!  Fun way to get to the end of a show - there was an encore so definitely more music!!!"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay has done amazing shows that go all out with confetti, fire, fireworks, lights...etc. What I love the most is that they care to make their tour sustainabile and try to cut down on their emissions. Love they let people bring in reusable water bottles to refill and they have a stationary bike for people to ride to convert to energy for the show."
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay is amazing live. If you ever have the chance to see them, take it. Even if you only like one song. You‚Äôll be happy you went by the end of the night. I guarantee it."
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,I think everyone needs to attend a Coldplay concert at least once in their life. I‚Äôll be jumping at the next opportunity to watch again! üåü
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"What an incredible show! The lights, the production, the environmentally friendly aspect, the sound quality, the intimate feeling despite being a huge stadium, we loved it all!!"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,This was the first time I saw Coldplay - although I‚Äôve loved them for years. Wow. I loved every second of their show. and it‚Äôs definitely one of my favorite concerts ever. The LED bracelets- amazing - and the dedication to saving the climate is simply incredible and admirable. I LOVED this show.
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I‚Äôve been going to Coldplay concerts since 2005 so I‚Äôm a fan, but this is one of their best concerts ever! Chris M‚Äôs joy, enthusiasm, and humility are so infectious that you can‚Äôt help feeling the same way! They played all their best work, and sprinkled new music here and there. I loved the lit wristbands, the fireworks, and especially the finale with the choir from South Africa. What an amazing show!! I‚Äôm already waiting for their new music and next tour."
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay has been in my bucket list for a while and was finally able to make it to their concert. I gotta say, it was an amazing experience! The show is extremely well produced, so much energy and it's clear they enjoy performing and interacting with the public... Only downside is that the show was a bit short for what I have seen in other concerts, but still worth it!"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,We traveled from Michigan for this event and it was worth every penny. It was magical‚Ä¶. Coldplay made us feel a part of their show and seemingly so grateful for their fans. It was truly such an amazing experience and hope to one day see them again. The absolute best show I‚Äôve ever been to!
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Excellent performance and Coldplay went over their greatest hits. The visual effects were pretty cool and also the interaction with the crowd was great. Liked the activity of the spheres with the audience.
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Not sure if it was the stadium itself, but at times, it sounded like Chris was off tempo, to include the beginning of the show. I liked Head Full of Dreams better, but it‚Äôs always such an incredible experience with the lights, music, audience engagement, and fireworks."
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Coldplay put on an amazing show! Saw them at Snapdragon stadium in San Diego. I love their messages to the world ‚ô•Ô∏è The bikes and the energy capturing floor is such a cool way to power the concert ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"If I could experience this every night for the rest of my life, then I‚Äôd surely die happy. Watching Coldplay perform was the most amazing experience ever. I highly recommend that anyone that can, please go experience this for yourself."
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Best concert I‚Äôve been to along with Taylor Swift. Unimaginable vibes and kind community. Loved their sustainability and kindness and friendliness aspect. They truly deserve the world.
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"To buy the tickets it was really difficult, spent like 2 hrs to update its frozen when it was time to pay and had a hard time. Thank God my boss purchased ours and made the transfer by the app. At the concert it was so difficult to bring the tickets to look for the seats, spent 40 min loading the app and the gpay link to get them"
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I took my nephew to see Coldplay for his birthday on the 27th. He was open to going, even though he didn‚Äôt know too much about their music.  He left a convert.  Chris Martin was the ultimate entertainer, being amazingly talented and also making such a connection with the crowd.  All the guys seemed to be having a wonderful time- lots of smiles.  They are all such amazing creators and conduits of positive, encouraging music.  The stadium was a clean and well organized venue.  The food and drinks were delicious, and the seats were great.  The venue has a very intimate feel for an arena.  The opening acts were very talented. All-in-all, an experience more wonderful than I imagined."
10/1/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Incredible experience. Coldplay was amazin and H.E.R. was a breath of fresh air.  Beautiful voice and great shows both!
7/12/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"I loved seeing Coldplay at Soldier Field. It was my first stadium concert and my first time seeing Coldplay. I loved every second of it. I did NOT sit down. I danced the entire concert, with the exception of going to the bathroom and beer runs. I HIGHLY recommend going to see Coldplay!! They put on a great show. If Coldplay comes to your town GO SEE THEM!!!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This show was pure magic, the band sounded great and the production was outstanding.  The syncronized lighted wristbands really added to the experience. The best live show I've seen in months"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Wow. Cannot believe tickets were selling for $20. H.E.R. gave an outstanding performance. I was provided with tickets right on the floor and made it there early enough to be up front. Wow! Hope I have this opportunity again.
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I travelled from Guatemala to see them and THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT. I went with my husband and it has been by far one of the best experiences we have had. Thank you Coldplay for being the persona that you are, for giving us fans such an amazing experience, for making us part of environmental change. We love and admire you."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This is my second time seeing Coldplay and of course they didn‚Äôt disappoint. The concert was amazing from start to finish. What a way to bring back an amazing show after covid. Coldplay is a band that will always have you smiling!
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"First of all , I love this band . This was my fist time seeing them live. The staging , the sound , the wrist bands , and Chris Martin‚Äôs voice and energy were excellent and exactly what I wanted and expected.
The set list was very good and the length and flow of the concert was also very good.
My complaints are that I had the feeling that it was a times a concert of live
musicians and sometimes an EDM show with a DJ spin-off times. Now , I get it that they have gone off into this new ‚Äú
world‚Äù sound but if you are going to do that , at least add some additional backing singers and some keyboard and synth players so it is real. It was clearly heavily backing tracked and at times drowned out the actual instruments . The lack of any spot or stage lighting on the band members gave me the feeling that a lot of the show was tracked . For a big time band making big time money this is fraudulent IMO. Put real musicians and programmers up there and light it up like an actual performance . I literally could not tell if the bass player was actually producing any bass notes most of the night , and I am a bass player. I guess probably only musician fans care about this . My fault for not seeing them a decade ago. It was fun and the songs are great . The new album sounds like yoga music ."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Next to Pink Floyd, greatest concert I‚Äôve ever seen.  I was never really a fan, but my wife lives them. Got her tix for her birthday and we were both blown away. The concert definitely made a fan out of me"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Everything about the Philly venue was perfect. H.E.R. and Coldplay were amazing, as anticipated. Coldplay is gracious, environmentally conscious, and 10000000% fun, talented, and creative! Haven‚Äôt missed a tour since 2000 and will continue seeing them. The rain came down heavily at the conclusion of the show and Chris stripped off his already sweaty shirt‚Ä¶.nice bonus for us:-)"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Amazing use of technology, confetti and pyrotechnics. Such a professional group playing through the rain and highly organized. Great music. Total pros. So cool they entered and exited on the ground level and slap hands with their fans. Love their level of commitment to their fans and the environment. The staff at the Linc were so nice and very helpful. Best large concert show ever!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Breath taking!!! Best concert ever.  Fun from the start until the end.  Just perfect.  The crowd was full of good people whom all shared the love of this beautiful music!! Got to be on the big screen too with huge smiles and love for Coldplay.  Their music managed to touch all parts of my life and was able to feel every emotion from their live music, the lights, spheres,  confetti, fireworks, and love and laughter with the crowd whom all share the love of Coldplay. üíó"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Besides the traffic, this was an awesome show!!  So much interaction, great sound, awesome band. Gave me the chills at times!!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This was my 3rd time seeing Coldplay and they didn't disappoint. I cant say it was their best performance but it was definitely a lot of fun. The crowd was engaged. I hope they come back to PA again.
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Great crowd . Light bands we wore awesome . Saw him in Phila so it was really great he sang Fly Eagles Fly ! And H.E.R wore an Eagles jersey ( Malcolm Jenkins #)
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This was my first time seeing Coldplay and it was by far my favorite concert yet! From the sound to the lighting and their concern for all things environmental, they are a class act."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I‚Äôve seen Coldplay about 10 times now and I swear, each time is better. This was an UNREAL show and the energy was truly ELECTRIC!!! It was my husbands 2nd time seeing them but the first time was at The Today Show. He is now addicted and wants to go again!!! If you‚Äôre debating, just DO IT. You will not regret it!!!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I had been waiting my whole life to finally go to a Coldplay concert. I waited so long that I was scared it wouldn‚Äôt meet my expectations, but it surpassed them by a billion. It was the best concert I had ever been to. I was so overwhelmed by how happy I was tgat I couldn‚Äôt stop crying for hours after the concert. If I had the money I would go to every single one. I cant wait for the day I get to experience a Coldplay concert again. They‚Äôre the best!!!! Everyone should go to a Coldplay concert at least once in their life. It was truly life changing."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This show was incredible.  Coldplay always delivers an amazing performance.  Even with the rain, uninformed staff and audio issues, I still had the time of my life.  I would recommend going to see them to anyone anywhere."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Show itself was amazing! Coldplay never disappoints! My only negative was getting into the show - we had floor tickets and had to go all the way to the South Gate which made no sense because by the time we walked through we were intermingled with everyone else! Would have been much quicker to have a ‚ÄúGA‚Äù line at every gate. Also there should be a bank of portable potties on the floor.
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,First time seeing Coldplay that was a mistake on my part. This show was fantastic. I've seen over 300 shows. This was probably the best light show I've ever seen and I've seen great ones. The music was great. The interaction with the audience was great. The only drawback was the sound was a little too loud creating distortion of the vocals. But earplugs fix that issue.
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"First post Covid concert experience and it did not disappoint.  It was a celebration of life, love and happiness!  Glad to be back at concerts and no better way to start than with Coldplay"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Once we got in, Coldplay put on a great show!  Quite a difference from our first time seeing them at PNC Arts Center!  More bling!  Getting in though was a nightmare. Horrible venue. No direction. Would never go to this venue again‚Ä¶too disorganized."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,The concert was awesome! I am extremely glad that I made it to the show and got to experience HER for the first time as well as Coldplay. The concert was a great experience despite the rain. Can‚Äôt wait to do it again!
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This concert was amazing start to finish. The vocals for starters Chris Martin nailed it. The set and lights including the cool interactive bracelets kept the place aglow. Even in the pouring rain people stayed till the end of this magical experience.
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"We‚Äôve been waiting to see Coldplay for several years and this concert did not disappoint. The band was fantastic! Light displays, confetti showers and fireworks were spectacular! Venue staff was super polite and friendly. We had a great time."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,I have seen Coldplay before. This show was excellent. The sound was really good. It was a great concert. Hope they come back again. Highly recommend seeing them. Danced and sang all night long.
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Lead off performers Lizzy McAlpine and H.E.R.  we‚Äôre fantastic.  H.E.R is so talented and played guitar keyboards and drums and REALLY has some pipes. 

Coldplay performed all the great hits and the stage for the Music Of The Spheres was awesome for an outdoor evening show including synchronized fireworks.  Chris Martin tells interesting stories and bits to lead into the songs and gotta love the UK accent

Too bad it started raining before the end"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Drinks super pricey, all organized but like always people so rude and no manners at all, security the best and kind to guide us, I‚Äôm Philadelphian but first time on the LFF!! Hope is not the last. Again the best concert ever !!!!! So long Colplay hope see you sometime on my forwarded life!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The Coldplay concert in Philadelphia on Wednesday, June 8, 2022 was phenomenal.  Also, everyone at Lincoln Financial Field did a great job. The whole experience was perfect."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"It was a sentimental concert for me and my  son. We throughly enjoyed the entire experience, the concert bracelets, the globe balloons, and Chris Martins energy and command of the stage, it was a Wednesday night in Philly that would never happen again and just so good that it did."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,It was very nostalgic & touching. Starting from messages of giving back to the earth in knowing that our ticket purchased contributed to that was the most selfless act. It was also creative to have the bikes & small stations help light up the stage through kinetic energy. That was very thoughtful. There was so much love in the atmosphere. Coldplay did great in including their guests & touching their souls. They were very outgoing on stage & great with each other. I would definitely go to any or ALL of their concerts again. Nothing but LOVE!
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I've been to tons of shows and live events over the years.. And Coldplay is by far the best I've ever seen.. They are in another league.  First time seeing them and they were worth every penny and the 12 hour drive there and back.   Absolutely everything was amazing.  Crowd was amazing.  The band was flawless and combined with all the other entertainment aspects it was fun from start to finish..  the glowing bracelets is also something unique to them.  Really makes for a great visual during the show.  I would go anywhere in the country to see them again.  If you are debating if coldplay is worth it, they absolutely are.. Im 100% sold that they are the most exciting live band in the world ."
6/12/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The Coldplay concert was well worth attending.  It was an entertaining event.  The two acts preceding the main event were all right.  
My husband and I hope to attend future concerts as long as they keep touring."
6/12/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I saw videos of them perform in 2017 and was like ‚ÄúI gotta see them next time they tour‚Äù and I saw them at Met Life in NJ, and omg. They were amazing with all their hits and great new ones from Music of the spheres. The energy and visuals were insane even from high up. Everyone should see them."
7/11/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"WOW there are no words! We have been to many concerts and this just blew us away! From the minute they came on stage to the end, it was just an immersive experience of all senses. There wasn't a person in the place not jumping around, singing and dancing. It was out of this world, we loved every minute. Plus they are really good guys, brining a nice message, rare these days. If you get chance, go, you won't regret it!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"This was the best concert I‚Äôve had!!! All the experience was great (with the exception of the parking logistic). But everything was awesoooome!! The sound, the show, food, seats, EVERYTHIIIIING!!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"I wasn‚Äôt even that into Coldplay, just going with a friend, but I was quickly won over. They waited to start because so many people were held back by the horrible traffic, so I didn‚Äôt miss the show! The event made an effort to have environmental initiatives that I‚Äôve never seen before, including having people on bikes and kinetic floors powering it. I loved the performance aspect of engaging the crowd as well as the music- even though I only knew their old stuff, their new songs were great too. So much fun!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I‚Äôve been to hundreds of music festivals and shows in my life, and Coldplay Philly 2022 was literally the Best Concert Experience I‚Äôve ever witnessed! 55,000 fans all singing and dancing to every song?? 55,000 fans all connected together through LED Wristbands?? Please Come Back Soon! ü§Øüëè‚ú®"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This was by far the best concert I‚Äôve been too‚Ä¶ this was an experience of a lifetime and a great bday gift for my ‚ù§Ô∏è
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I have been to a lot of concerts but this was on a whole new level.  Great music, tons of positive energy, visual effects were out of this world.
Please come back soon Coldplay!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Maybe the best show we‚Äôve ever seen for lighting, fireworks, lasers etc.  Musically, the band didn‚Äôt fail to deliver an exceptional performance.  Overall, one of the top 10 best shows we‚Äôve ever seen and we‚Äôve seen an incredible number of shows."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay felt a little BiG concert ‚Äúme too‚Äù like‚Ä¶what does that mean, well it just felt kinda boring tbh, and that they were going through the motions. Crowd lighting was impressive and if Chris didn‚Äôt smile and act like he was having fun I‚Äôm not sure they are worth seeing live tbh as the remainder of the band don‚Äôt really entertain. Sound was ok for a big arena. 
What am I comparing CP too, well I took my daughter to Shaun Mendes in Sydney along with 30,000 other young girls and I can tell you that that young man certainly knows how to entertain with great energy and charisma."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay puts on such an incredible show - there are no words. I‚Äôve been reliving it all week. The lights, flashing wristbands, song choices, fireworks‚Ä¶ it was an absolutely incredible night. I‚Äôll be waiting for their next tour with baited breath."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Unequivocally best concert I've ever been to. And that includes U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, etc. Coldplay shared gratitude for what it took for audience to be there, included the audience on a personal level in the show, and the tech and performance level was insane. We drove to Philly from Chapel Hill, NC and it was worth every hour of driving, every dollar of hotel, parking and expenses. Would go again tomorrow if they were there! Spectacular."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The concert was great !! The stadium staff sucked ! It was soo unorganized‚Ä¶ I paid $350 for 2 floor seats & other people paid $30-50 for floor seats, so not fair !! They let just anyone on the floor so we were pushed all the way to the back & we paid the most for our tix.. I didn‚Äôt like that there weren‚Äôt any actual seats on the floor like last time ‚Ä¶"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This show was fantastic. The production value was on point and created an amazing atmosphere. And Coldplay absolutely delivered. Not even the rain could spoil it!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I‚Äôve been to a lot of excellent big concerts by a lot of artists over the years. Coldplay set a new standard. 

Their ability to engage an audience of 55,000 people in an immersive concert experience is beyond anything I‚Äôve ever seen."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Horrible parking situation at Lincoln Financial Field, completely disorganized. Entrance to stadium was completely disorganized, waited in line for over an hour, just to be told to go to a different entrance for floor access- turns out multiple entrances had floor access, and i blame ticketmaster & eagles organization for not communicating that better & clearer. As for the show, very unimpressed with song selection, seemed very ""rush through setlist to get out quick"", given the hype of last coldplay tour (yeah, okü§•ü§îü§ë). All of that with the fact that the floor seemed over-sold, way too many people on floor- no room anywhere with people just knocking/bumping/running into you while trying to enjoy show. This leads me to final point... sound & system mix was terrible from floor & upper side areas.. had friends in those sections who relayed they had hard time making out what was being said or sung. Wrist band show was cool again."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"It was Coldplay's best concert ever. 1st time I seen them in Philadelphia and I came from Florida. The best and emotional time was when they were singing Fix You and it starting raining, I cried and seen other fans cried. Such a beautiful song with beautiful words. Thank you Coldplay til next time."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay puts on a truly amazing show. I feel so lucky that I finally saw them in concert after being a huge fan for so long. It was equally as emotional as it was fun and I had the time of my life. Checked off my bucket list!!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This concert has shot it‚Äôs way to the very top of my list. Chris reaches out grabs you and transports you to another place in time. Then backs it up with a light show that is not only made possible by the audience participation it‚Äôs an-out of body experience. Brilliant Coldplay. You rock like no other. Don‚Äôt stay away so long next time. Your music can save the world. Thank you for understanding our need for music üé∂. You deliver for sure. ‚òÆÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüé∂üéµ
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The music, the fireworks, the lighted wristbands made this show one of the best concerts I‚Äôve been too.  It was so great they did the Eagles fight song.  They went out of their way to make it a show for Philadelphia."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Saw Coldplay at the Link. Clear instructions on how to download the tickets, bag restrictions for the venue and parking. Coldplay was awesome! I would absolutely go see them again. Great concert"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This was my second time seeing Coldplay live. Both experiences blew me away. This band puts on one the the best shows in the world. You feel so connected with them, and the people around you, it's indescribable until you experience it yourself and it is just so so special. I will tell anyone that will listen to me that you have to see them live at least once in your life. It's a beautiful emotional rollercoaster, and not to mention fun as all hell!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,1st time seeing Coldplay and it won‚Äôt be my last. Really enjoyed the show and music. Definitely recommend seeing them. They seem like good guys too and were gracious enough to do an encore for Philly in the rain.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"From the beginning to end. What a life changing experience, super clean environment and organized so well. From the lights and fireworks with every detail well thought out. Thank you for such a beautiful concert. I could see them over and over if I could."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,The Coldplay concert in Philadelphia was the best concert I have ever been to. Looking around you could see that everyone was having the best time. The band was awesome and played their best songs.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Imagine having a personalized concert with one of the biggest Band in the world! They paused and restart the song just to make the experience even more unimaginable!

The Visual, the music, the crowd! Everything‚Äôs perfect!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay was amazing (rain and all)! I saw them in Philadelphia and had the best time. It was such a positive experience after a hard school year!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Everything was super amazing! The show, the songs, the band, the lights, the atmosphere. The only thing that was not cool is us having to go back to our car to put our vaporizer in but when we were sitting in the stadium people had vapes‚Ä¶"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This was the 2nd time I have seen COLDPLAY and can't wait for them to come back to Philly!! Their energy is infectious and their kindness shines, throughout their performance.
Love those guys!!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,The concert was high energy from the start to the finish.  Pyrotechnics throughout.  Lots of great old songs and enough of the new ones to satisfy everyone.  Chris Martin really seemed humble and wants to connect with the crowd.  The Eagles victory song was a great addition.  One of the top 5 concerts I've ever been to.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The show was pretty good but the sound got messed up multiple times and ruined the songs.  His mic cut out, instruments cut out‚Ä¶maybe it was the rain?"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Seats in section 102 were ideal, sound was a little choppy, but Coldplay continues to be one of the best live shows ever.  They put on a wonderful show and were engaging all the way through.  Downside on the venue, long bathroom lines, no soap or paper towels, and that was before the concert!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Part rock concert/part rave - all inclusive arena sized fun ! I‚Äôm a huge Coldplay fan & thought they were one of the few tours that would bring me back to a stadium for a show since the pandemic started - and they did not disappoint! Their opening three songs already topped their last tour. And the ‚ÄúFly Eagles Fly‚Äù sing a long during the encore was a nice gift to the Philly fans fighting off Mother Nature‚Äôs mini monsoon at that point. Coldplay is one of the most entertaining live bands with a deep catalog of hits that never miss their mark.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Everything was just spot on. Chris Martin sounded perfect and the music was great. The experience with the light up wrist bands, pyrotechnics, confetti and beachballs made it a night i won‚Äôt forget."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay were superb. Love their commitment to sustainability.  Laser lights, LED bracelets and a tremendous sound system that bordered on the too loud but didn‚Äôt actually hit it. A packed stadium enjoyed some Philly-personal comments by Chris Martin. Both warm up singers were great too especially H.E.R but to be honest the clarity of the sound for the warm up acts left a bit to be desired. If you didn‚Äôt know the songs, you had no chance of hearing the lyrics, for the most part. But tremendous music!  Great night out and worth every cent"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Parking was issue for people who arrived on time. I would suggest an hour early and tailgate.  The arrival traffic jam could have been handled better.  Otherwise great energy and great crowd and wonderful event.  Thanks to Cold play!  Wonderful night. Thanks for everything!  Wednesday night and rain all worth the band!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,The best concert I‚Äôve been too! It was such an in the moment experience! The lights and visuals were amazing. General admission was the place to be ! 10/10
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Wish I knew Coldplay wouldnt be on till 9pm. The opening act was a true waste of time. But Coldplay, the energy, the light up wristbands, the kindness you can see in their hearts, and the passion in their music is unbelievable. Such an amazing time."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Loved this concert..left early due to rain, but we truely lived what we saw. The led lights on the wrist were awesome."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This was my first Coldplay concert and it was an amazing night! My seats had a good view of the stage with no obstructed view!! Would definitely purchase tickets again!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Concert was great!
Parking experience was awful. Took as long to get in the Wells Fargo lot as it did to get to the stadium area - coming from Lansdale. They had 2 or 3 gates open for entry, while for Flyers, Sixers and Wells Fargo events 4 or 5 gates are open. 
Leaving was worse.  It took 90 minutes to get out of the parking lot... the concert was 120 minutes.  2 gates open for exit,  a complete and total disaster. Concert ended at 11:00, reached our car by 11:20 and exited the lot at 12:50. Unacceptable... and good look finding out who's responsible for parking management"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Great experience, good organization, the process of entrance was fast and easy, and the concert one of the best in my life !!!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay did not disappoint, they put on an amazing show that kept the crowd pumped and engaged.  The wristbands made the whole experience something special."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay was great! The venue was horrible and inefficiently managed. Traffic and parking was chaotic. Entrance and security was mismanaged and inefficient. No toilet paper in women‚Äôs bathroom (beginning of evening). Lines for beverages only to find out they are out of stock for the kind wanted.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"As usual Coldplay delivered a top notch concert. Skipped a few great songs but when you have so many great songs, you have to draw the line somewhere."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The genuinely look like they are having a great time.  We danced the whole show.  The wrist band lights were so cool as well as fire works.  Just wish it lasted longer but rain probably made them shorten up.  
Chris Martin is amazing."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Unbelievable show. I will never miss a Coldplay concert. The light show makes you feel a part of a larger whole‚Ä¶because guess what‚Ä¶as human beings we are.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,It was simply the best concert I have ever been to. The band was incredible and Chris martins voice and the band are better live then on the radio . Such a beautiful experience !!!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Absolutely awesome!  If I had 1 constructive criticism it would be that I wished they played a little longer than just 2 hours.   Nonetheless‚Ä¶Great concert!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I‚Äôve been a huge fan since 2000 (Parachutes), so it was long overdue that I actually see them live! It lived up to expectations and the show was fantastic. The tech and audio made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt at an outside venue. Despite the rain, the fan-driven crowded enjoyed the show and remained engaged from start to finish. It was a night I will never forget!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"best concert I have ever attended. The energy of the band, the lights, how Chris connected to the local audience. Everything was amazing."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This show was beyond what I imagined it would be.  It was beautiful.  It was engaging.  It was an experience I'll never forget and I'm so thankful we were able to see it.  Thank you Coldplay for putting on such a wonderful and well rounded show.  The lights were an amazing touch that continued the excitement while we heard our favorite songs!!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,It was such a good concert. Great music and the sight and sound of the pyrotechnics was amazing. Such an energetic group.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The band was amazing. We bought VIP tickets which gave us an awesome view of the stage. The led wristbands made for more visual interest.  We couldn‚Äôt find the VIP table and walked around the entire stadium. After an hour, we finally found it only for it to be closed and we therefore forfeited the extras we had paid for. When you pay extra for something you should receive it - the tables shouldn‚Äôt close before the band plays."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay knows how to put on a spectacular concert experience.  It was my first time seeing them live and I can wait till they come back to town so we can see them again!!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Every step of the way getting into the venue was a mess. We were led in the wrong direction by staff numerous times and the lines were a disaster. It took more than an hour from arriving at the venue to getting just inside the gate. Concert was awesome but definitely the worst experience I‚Äôve had at a venue in terms of logistics.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay hasn‚Äôt lost their touch!  Best concert ever!  It had everything, beach balls, confetti, interactive led bracelets, fireworks!!!

Despite the rain, Chris and the gang did not disappoint‚Ä¶even sing Fly Eagles Fly.  Just wish the rain would of held off for 20 more minutes so they would have played Viva LA Vida!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Most energetic and visually pleasing show I have ever seen. The band genuinely looks like they love what they are doing. This was my first Coldplay show. I will tell all my friends that they are a must see. I feel like it doesn‚Äôt even matter if you know the songs.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Perfect night..even when it thundered during their performance during Sparks...cooincidence but something else!  FLY EAGLES FLY üòÑ
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Literally the best night of my life. Don‚Äôt think another concert could top that, unless I go see them again but it was amazing!!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Loved this show so much. We were on the floor and danced all night. The band was amazing. It was such a cool experience to be part of the light show. We will remember it always. If your haven‚Äôt seen Coldplay live - you need to put this on your Bucket list.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I have seen probably over 100 concerts in my life and I do not think I ever saw this many cool effects. Light up LED wristbands were given to everyone who came and sitting up high I was able to see the color of the crowd literally light up to fit each song (for example during Yellow they all lit up yellow) lasers, fireworks, costumes, they really went above and beyond putting on a legendary show and of course the actual music was awesome too!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"First time to see Coldplay. AMAZING!!! Chris Martin is all energy. The sound, the lighting, especially the wristbands, the fireworks were off the charts. The rain did not stop us from having a fantastic time. The crowd was friendly and not too rowdy. I'd go see them again in a heartbeat."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better family experience for our two kids 7, 12. Both their first concert and can‚Äôt wait to get to the next show!!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay‚Äôs concert at the Linc was outstanding. The playlist, the stage, the fireworks. Everything was just incredible. Thank you Coldplay for such an amazing and unforgettable night!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I bought 5 tickets last fall spending for great seats so that I could bring my family with me to celebrate my 65th birthday!!!
H.E.R. Was amazing and I listen to her now and Coldplay was incredibly Brilliant!!! It was an Out of Body Experience! I‚Äôm soo grateful!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"What a wonderful experience. I knew the band was crazy talented but getting to see them live with my teenage daughter was unforgettable! The only bad part was the price of food and drinks inside the stadium. I‚Äôm not a wealthy guy so paying $70 for chicken fingers and two drinks was tough to swallow. Anyway, thanks Coldplay and H.E.R. For putting on a great show!!!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The show was incredible! We loved the bracelets and all of the crowd interactions. We love Coldplay, all they represent and their music is fabulous!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"From the opening to the end it was fantastic! ColdPlay was the last band on my bucket list (I‚Äôm 63 years old). I‚Äôve been to many, many, MANY, concerts and festivals. This was by far my favorite and totally exceeded my expectations !!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay outdid themselves that night. Hope we get to see them again. It started raining towards the end - maybe we should have been given raincoats
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"From the bands amazing enthusiasm to all the flashing lights, the concert was such an incredible experience. Would definitely recommend."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,I‚Äôve seen Coldplay many times and they always put on an amazing show! Something about this one had me feeling emotional. I had so much fun and was totally in my feels!! Will continue to see them every time they come. They always put a smile on my face! üëèüèΩ
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I had an amazing time at the Coldplay concert pn Wednesday. It doesn't even matter that they didn't play a few of my favorite songs. Their concerts are so much fun! Lights, lasers, confetti, fireworks, beach balls, dancing, and really great music! If you ever have a chance to see Coldplay live, GO! Ive been twice and they are the two best concerts I've been to!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This is my 4th coldplay concert and I love going. The light up bracelets are alway so fun and cool. We had a great time!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I have been to hundreds of shows, im old! I live live music. This show is one of the best i have ever been to! If you get the opportunity don't miss them! I won't!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Chris Martin is not only an amazing singer but he is a talented performer who is both backed and led by his awesome musician bandmates. They are fun. They are heartfelt. They care about people and our world. Their song choices ranged from Music of the Spheres to Yellow to Fix You and everything in between. The audience was all in with lights and singing and I had an experience that I've dreamed of for a loooooong time - I'll be 69 in a couple weeks. Special thanks to Chris for doing the stage run and jump on Viva la Vida. The best.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This will be the 4th time seeing Coldplay live and there are no words really to summarize how incredible of a live performance they are. The best way I can describe it, is it‚Äôs an experience. Between the bracelets, the fireworks, the confetti and the energy Chris Martin brings. I‚Äôll see them until they stop touring.

Now besides that, getting in Lincoln Financial Field was an absolute nightmare. We had GA tickets and there was ONE GATE you could go through to get into the venue. Hundreds of people being funneled into one place. And then the security was as slow as it could possibly be. Then after going through security you were put into ANOTHER line to have you ticket scanned and receive a bracelet. And then once inside you had to wait in yet ANOTHER line to be guided onto the field. Mind you this all took an hour JUST TO GET INTO THE VENUE. Thankfully we got inside before the show started. I have never been such a terrible mood before a concert before it was the worst experience I have ever had. I thought I got my venues mixed up and I was going for a White House tour, not an evening with the greatest band on earth."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Great vibe!   ü§ôüèº Coldplay is always an amazing show!! Full of life, love for all and sustainability!   Cool to see all the ways the show was powered.   Love that a portion of ticket sales goes to such great causes as well.  Clean oceans&rivers, helping wildlife and relief efforts across the globe üåé ‚ô•Ô∏è"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Music atmosphere were absolutely fantastic despite the weather.
The best thing about it was the fact that they didn‚Äôt mess with the songs.  They played them as of they were the original recording which Easter all is what we went to hear!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Phenomenal show from start to finish. They were amazing. Played to the whole stadium. Screens were great for visibility. Loved the lights/bracelets.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,overall the concert was better that I had expected. I really liked that security was nice and made sure everyone was safe. Coldplay itself was amazing and hope to see them in person again soon!!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay concerts are more than that, they are a celebration! A celebration of all that is good in humanity and the world. The Coldplay concert was and is a joyous feast for the senses. I leave feeling the way music should make me feel- inspired, amazed, moved, and changed. I love them and their concerts make me love their music even more."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Amazing show once again.  Coldplay always puts on a great show.  This was #7 for me and every time feels like the first time.  Chris Martin is one hell of a performer.  I‚Äôm so sad that it may have been the last time if they really retire.  üò¢
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay performs in a league of their own. Seeing them several times over the last 15 years they have never disappointed. The most recent show only outpaces their last performance. Truly a must see!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"ColdPlay really brought it. What an experience and although we were in a football stadium it felt intimate like we were in a small venue. The lights, the band, the play list‚Ä¶so great! And as always Chris is just awesome!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay puts on an amazing concert! Chris Martin‚Äôs kind, positive attitude is infectious and he is an awesome performer! I‚Äôve been to a lot of different concerts over the years, but Coldplay‚Äôs concerts are truly a great experience ‚ù£Ô∏è"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Chris and the band put on a heck of a show. Our tickets were row 6. On our feet dancing the whole night!! The only complaint was how loud the sound was that when he spoke as well as sang (as well as the opening act H.E.R.) you could not even understand what they were saying.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Songs were brilliant, venue was superb and thecshow topped it iff tonbe a nightvyo remember. Making Memories..."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Such an amazing experience! The whole show and event was show stopping! They pushed through in the rain and it felt like such a personal experience! AMAZING!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Show was amazing.  Great venue and perfect view of show. Only down side was how expensive drinks were and the crazy tax on top of that.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay gave a fantastic performance and the show was a lot of fun to attend. The bracelets we were given upon entry lit in sync with the music, the balloons bouncing around the audience were a lot of fun to hit as they came by, and all of this together with the lights/pyrotechnics served to make us feel like participants in the show. It was a lot of fun to be in the audience and Coldplay performed so many of their fantastic hits from over the years I will definitely be getting tickets next time they play in Philadelphia."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Infinity tickets were amazing. We got GA tickets and for my first time seeing Coldplay I could not be more happy with their performance.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"They had fireworks, balloons, a nice open dance floor. The stadium was packed to the top. He sang new and old songs."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"From the arm bands lighting up,the crowd singing and dancing to the greatest feeling as tho you were constantly feeling like part of the band. The band played the best music that never disappointed the crowd. I have never been to a concert that had this level of energy, I will be watching for the next tour !!!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay was outstanding in their Philadelphia performance. They know how to relate to their audience. The lighting, visual effects and fireworks üí• were awesome. The rendition of Fly Eagles Fly was appreciated by all of the Philadelphia Eagles fans in attendance."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I can't say enough about the incredible show Cold Play put on for us in Philly. I've never felt so alive it so emersed in a concert. The band gave their all from start to finish even though it started pouring halfway through their set. They made every effort to  turn the crowded into participants not just spectators. It's the days after the fact and I still have chills from the experience. I liked Cold Play before i I saw them live; note, I love them."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"1st Coldplay show for one of us, 2nd time for the other... Awesome performance! High energy, great music... Exceeded our expectations!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I love the movement toward making the Earth better during the concerts. I also just love Coldplay's music.

The reason I took off the star was because of the blown out speakers. Almost everything was muffled, and if I didn't know the lyrics to something I would not be able to understand it. So the speakers could have been a lot clearer probably lower the volume so it wouldn't sound so blown out."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,I attended Coldplay concert on 8th June. It was fabulous experience. I loved Coldplay. Entire concert was magical.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Not only is Coldplay musically talented but their concert is a whole experience!! From the lights to the back displays to the fireworks! Everything is so colorful and well put together! Their music is also excellent and one of a kind!
6/11/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The organization of the concert left a mostly positive impression, except navigating in the stadium itself - finding our seats turned out to be a challenge, signs, and markings were not very helpful, but the staff helped us. The music and the show itself were amazing."
6/11/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"After a never ending pandemic, I never thought I would have a chance to fulfill my long standing dream to see Coldplay.  The band gave it their all on Sunday night at Met Life Stadium.  The sheer energy shown by Chris Martin blows me away.  Coldplay‚Äôs music and feeling of the concert was uplifting, positive and a nod to our collective human-ness, our need to connect and for taking in and sharing love back to the world.  

Simply an en amazing concert and experience.  Thank you to Coldplay, it‚Äôs crew and the venue, and my fellow concert goers for making this a once in a lifetime dream come true."
6/10/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"They had an amazing performance, had the crowed going the entire show, amazing light show and fireworks. Chris is a very heartfelt person, Loved every second of it, without a doubt I will go to another tour if they have another one. First time seeing them and definitely not the last!! Bravo!"
6/10/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"What a great show! Amazing all around experience with great music, light show, fireworks, and more. seeing Coldplay is a must!"
6/10/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,One of the best concerts of my life! I will see again as soon as possible!
6/10/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I've been to my fair share of concerts over the years, and this ranks among the best ever. Phenomenal experience all around, from the artistry to the lighting to the pyrotechnics. You can tell Coldplay pour everything into it and want their fans to have the best time ever. Just mind blowing, really."
6/10/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,My dentist also went with her family and her kids said it was fantastic. I think that the show was great and then Bruce showed up at the end to put the icing on the cake! I think we all wish we had the energy Chris displayed on the stage.
6/10/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,While I've always been a fan of Coldplay this was the first time I saw them live and it won't be the last.  From the beautiful stage to all the attention to detail to making this an eco-friendly production. Also they couldn't have picked a better set list.  They played all the favorites.
6/10/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The show itself was great. 
A few things soured the experience: 
1. There was only junk food to choose from at the venue. Not a single apple or banana were available. 
2. The sound at the show was bad, I could hardly make out the words I know by heart. 
3. The long lines to board the trains at the end of the show took forever. 

Other than that, Coldplay are the best show!"
6/10/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"I bought a ticket to see Coldplay by myself for their show in Chicago on the 28th of May. I had such a GREAT time that I decided to purchase a ticket for their show on the 29th. I‚Äôm glad that I did, this experience was so surreal. Definitely one of the best concerts that I‚Äôve EVER been to"
6/10/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,"The light show was amazing! It was like a big EDM party with lights flashing, pyrotechnics, and Chris Martin's insatiable energy. They played for over 2 hours on 2 stages and Lupe Fiasco joined them to sing 2 songs. Opener H.E.R. seemed off rhythm with her guitar but first opener Drama was an amazing Soul singer. Venue was so-so, but seeing Coldplay for the first time in 20 years was very different than the first 2 smaller venues I saw them at. Good that they're trying to keep up though."
6/9/22,FedExField - Landover,Amazing. Judt like last time. Took my son this time (he's 9) and he had a blast too. Will come see them again next time they come!
6/9/22,FedExField - Landover,"Had a blast at the concert; got to the venue EARLY so we had NO problems with the parking!  LOVED the opening acts and Coldplay put on a wonderful show.  The amount of energy is electrifying!  They could've skipped using the puppet but it was not a deal breaker.  Sad that one day soon this band will stop touring.  They really care about the environment; was happy to see everything GREEN-themed. LOVED the wrist bands, fireworks, balloons and confetti.  Keep up the great work!  Thanks for the special  DC song from the good 'ole WHFS festival days!  Do not miss this band when they return!  We'll be there!"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The only other concert that compares was the Coldplay concert I went to in 2017! SO AMAZING.
Band sounded stunning and of course the visuals were out of this world! The light up bracelets really make the stadium breathtaking. A must see!"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"what an absolute banger of a show.  even the $20 tickets wayyyyy up and to the side were an awesome experience.  it was like a giant stadium-sized party.  Chris Martin is adorable, Bruce Springsteen was the best possible surprise and I will never shut up about this."
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,This performance was amazing i loved everything about it and the visual effects got better and better each song. I will be going to the next coldplay concert any and everytime they perform.!
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,This was my first time seeing Coldplay and they exceeded any expectations that I had!! Such a diverse crowd which really shows how they can connect with all audiences. Absolutely will see them again!!!
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Loved every minute & every note of this show!! We came from Ontario, Canada as there are currently no Canadian dates for their tour. 
It was my 3rd time seeing Coldplay & they never disappoint. It was our 1st trip to NYC & NJ‚Ä¶..Would go back in a heartbeat üíó 
Thank you gentlemen,  for all you do for your fans üíï"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I was there with my kids, 11 & 7, their first concert (!!) and it was amazing!! We all had a great time, danced and jumped and loved every moment. The sound was great, the band was amazing and lots of surprises!! :)"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I‚Äôve been attending Coldplay concerts for over a decade now, and I don‚Äôt plan on stopping for as long as they tour. There is not a bad seat in the house for their concerts. Coldplay goes out of their way with light up wristbands to make sure every fan in the venue feels like a part of the show. Already looking forward to the next time Coldplay tours the U.S."
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Loved it, loved it, loved it! They are electric and make the crowd feel so warm and welcome to the show. The pyrotechnics, confetti guns and balloons made the show just so good!"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,The entrance at the stadium was a little un organized. They will sent you to different lines. Employees didn‚Äôt know well how to direct the crowds. Because of that I got there on the first train but I couldn‚Äôt get in for a while and I didn‚Äôt get the spot I wanted in arena.
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I‚Äôm so happy I got to experience such an amazing show with my daughter, son  and husband! Coldplay show, music, lyrics, effects, lighting, fireworks, positive message and energy, everything was simply dreamy. To top it all off the opening shows Bea Miller, H.E.R. and Bruce Springsteen as a surprise guest!!! Unforgettable experience!!!"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"There are not enough words to explain how amazing this concert was. Coldplay is always about good music, love, respect and most importantly having fun! Can't wait till they tour again."
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"ColdPlay was Awesome. Chris Martin had so much energy. The balloons, confetti, wristband lights, the multiple stages. And Bruce Springsteen topped the night. The family has a incredible time."
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,Loved all of the new eco friendly changes at the stadium! Everything was very clean. Concert was incredible.
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I‚Äôve been to a lot of concerts and this was by far my favorite and blew me away. Being on the floor made all the difference. Cannot recommend enough!
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"it was such a wonderful show. my friend and i drove 6.5 hours to see them, and it was more than worth it. wonderful visuals, wonderful music, wonderful band. 10/10 would see them again!!!"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I‚Äôve been waiting years to see Coldplay and this show was everything I‚Äôd hope it would be and more. Can‚Äôt wait to see them again someday.
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Coldplay‚Äôs performance at the MetLife Stadium in NJ on June 5th was phenomenal. The interaction between Chris Martin and the audience was uplifting and genuine. Their music gave us a moment in time that we were able to enjoy & appreciate their music. The fireworks, laser lights, and light up wristbands added to the spectacular performance. The images of hearts created with illumination of red wristbands reminded everyone to value and share love. In a world full of uneasiness it was a night to escape the worries of the world and be at peace. Chris Martin‚Äôs positive messages and energy was uplifting. The best concert I have attended! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Seats were great, Coldplay is amazing. Great concert, Bruce was a bonus as I looked for my vehicle...lol"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The Coldplay show was absolutely amazing!  The songs were wonderful, as always, but the experience was incredible!  Coldplay shows always make you feel more hopeful, optimistic, and overall filled with 
joy when you leave. As a venue, MetLife was awesome!  They let GA in a bit early and we‚Äôre very polite in sectioning us out and having us go down to the floor in small groups so no one was running. GREAT show, GREAT venue, GREAT fans!!"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,The show was amazing I don't think anyone will top it
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I loved how they make you feel part of the show, they make you feel like you're literally a sky full of stars"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"As always, Coldplay was amazing, from the lightup wrist bands, to the fireworks, to a night of great music and pure fun!  Coldplay is simply awesome!"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I don‚Äôt really listen to cold play on my own, my father loves them so I know a few songs‚Ä¶ I this was the second concert we‚Äôve been to and there was no issues at all.. amazing light show, great energy all around"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"it was such an awesome experience, the energy in the stadium was amazing and I would go again if they ever come back to nj!"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Great concert as always.    This is probably the 20th time we have seen Coldplay in concert,  just when you think it can't get any better it does.   It was my first concert since COVID and I can't think of a better group to go see.   It's not just a concert it is a whole experience.    To top it off Bruce Springsteen made a special guest appearance and did 2 songs.    What a great night"
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I‚Äôve been to plenty of concerts before but not as quite as beautiful as seeing Coldplay. They put on a spectacular show. The best concert ever for me in a wonderful venue.
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"It was my dream get a ticket to watch Coldplay concert. More than 10 years trying to buy a single one in Brazil but I wasn't succeed. Now, watch them returning from the pandemic, at Metlife Stadium (Jew Jersey - USA), was so amazing that I can't explain. It will be on my mind forever. No words can explain this concert experience. I SIMPLY LOVE COLDPLAY."
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I had the infinity ticket and we were seated at section 308. The price was perfect, affordable because we got the promo. The seat view was also perfect even if we were far almost the top we can see thru the screen, sung, jumped and dance to the music. Our section was so AWESOME üòé It was like the cool kids sitting together. The transpo going to and from was smooth for us. I‚Äôve been to Metlife Stadium before and this is my second time so I know a little bit where to go and what time should we left. Overall, the experience was a hella fantastic, goosebumps, lovely, wonderful, legendary experience for me and my friend."
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Just saw Coldplay June 5, 2022 at Met Life Stadium. This is my 6th time seeing the band and they are better and better every single time. The show was flawlessly produced as always and is pure bliss and happiness."
6/9/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Awesome show! They played many classics as well as many off the new album. The fireworks, lights, and led bracelets were out of this world. I would definitely recommend any fans to go."
9/7/22,Soldier Field - Chicago,I‚Äôm tears from the moment the fireworks went off to the very end. An amazing experience I‚Äôll never forget. I wish I could live this concert again ‚ù§Ô∏è
7/6/22,FedExField - Landover,"This was my second time to see Coldplay, and once again, it was a thrill! From the moment the guys came on stage, the music was awesome, as were the lights and fireworks. I have been a Coldplay fan for many years, and seeing them live has created some of my very best memories. It's amazing how good music can make you feel. I also love the fact that Coldplay does so many positive things with their fame and money, which is not something you see that often from celebrities. There were images and information projected prior to the concert to show some of their worldwide projects. As far as the musical selection, there was a great mix from all of the albums, from Parachutes to Music of the Spheres. My daughter's boyfriend, who is actually a country fan, was impressed and even commented that ""Chris Martin has the voice of an angel."" (Well, I already knew that, but still...) It was a really fun night, and I can't wait to see my British Boys again!"
7/6/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"It was a unique experience; I wish I had gotten floor tickets so I could try out the cool bikes and trampoline; that looked fun.  I have seen Coldplay before and enjoyed the feeling so much that I wanted to see them again.  They didn't disappoint.  It's hard to describe, but I just feel weightless at their shows.  Like I feel happy, lighter in heart.  People look at me funny for loving their shows so much, but it's just so hard to convey the value in the way they make me feel.  

H.E.R. was as amazing as I thought she'd be.  I knew of the guitar skills, but she does drums too!  And she can play drums WHILE singing??  Talent.  Her whole team = talent.  I would definitely see H.E.R. again.  It was a mix of rock and R&B, like...RR&B!  I loved the energy and the music.  Excellent choice of partnership."
8/5/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Genuinely the best concert I‚Äôve ever attended. I went with my dad who‚Äôs a big coldplay fan, my mom who solely listens to music in our language, and me who‚Äôs a casual listener with lots of nostalgia. All 3 of us really loved the concert. The atmosphere was amazing and I‚Äôve never seen performers look like their having as much fun as Coldplay. Their interactions with the audience were great and their talent unparalleled. The beautiful lights and the fact that they try to make their concerts as green as possible is icing on top of the cake. If someone can only go to one concert I would really recommend Coldplay, they know how to put on a show and give you an amazing time."
7/2/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,One of the highlights of my life. I have been a fan of Coldplay since Mylo Xyloto and this just brought tears to my eyes. Simply beautiful.
