9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Coldplay was amazing.  The energy and love they send out throughout the whole time on stage is incredible.  I could watch them everyday.  Every song has so much emotion it’s hard not to cry.  If you have never seen them you gotta put it on your bucket list. Highly recommended.
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Very organised, love Coldplay, sang all of their hits. Very energetic, beautiful night of music. H.E.R is incredible! Was not a fan of the person who opened for H.E.R. This venue usually will have / had in attendance kids of all ages , fan of Coldplay and H.E.R, should at least be warned that person who will open up to H.E.R will have an E rated song material and visuals ."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I have to say that this being my very first concert at this stadium me and my family too much to desire, starting with the access to  the stadium witch haves some much space to park but hard to get in too, the venue very impressive set up, good security services but don't know how to direct people and poor people skills to deal with the customers especially when the customer is younger than themselves, I'm born on 73 and I have to deal with them all the time soo yes they need to be trained, the lighting inside the surroundings of the stadium should be on all the time especially around the vendors and stairs to the stadium entrance and the stairs to reach the seats down and up this is a basic need to see where we're going even if it's too the bathrooms especially when the lights of the concert goes out for 30 seconds to switch wardrobe or the bands take a break seriously that's a must not a question of if or when, the price's tlfor memorabilia is exorbitant to the point of price of a parking spot, beers and other drinks I can understand, after all this is a business...and you have to make a profit, the concert for as much I like Coldplay believe me is not a big as Metallica or Adelle or U2 sadly the experience left to much to desire I'm old school so I want to be entertained and happy walk out of there freaking happy and excited, not the opposite,  my expectations was to hear them playing there most iconic song the one's that made them famous from past and present, on a personal note the show was kind of ok-ishhh but some drunk caracters and some weed smoking millenials next to us that didn't even have tickets for their seats were just standing in the stairs and constantly being told to move but always came back, I might have said it was an average concert but the lights and Lazer show was OK show,  the exit from the venue it was horrible and for what is worth all of you need to seriously work on how to get people's vehicles out of there ASA freaking P we were there from 10 55 till midnight i mean i'm not crossing the border for Alcohol at least when I'm crossing to Mexico I know what to expect on my way back but getting out of a stadium is freaking ridiculous seriously you need to work on getting experience security or the local authorities to provide some level of support or the least some amount of knowledge on how to deal with traffic especially when dealing with 40 thousand people...Overall for me it was a bad experience,  getting in a problem, the venue not enough lighting,exorbitant price's, the concert good lighting show but poor in songs selection, too much talking not enough songs, I'm all for saving the world, but some singer need to sing and entertain me not bored me, and last but not least the exit to stadium a total drama and bad experience...in the future listen to feedback or ignore me and suffer for not being able to make a change on this information...thanks"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I have been to cold play before and this event was Lame. Starting with the volume of the concert, it was the most quiet concert I have ever been to. People were having conversations over the music. There was NO BASS whatsoever. Seems like either Snapdragon stadium has audio issues or the music engineers running the show dont have a clue. I want my money back."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Show was fantastic,  ist time at this venue getting to seats was tight and challenging but was worth it.  Sadly the parking management was terrible.  Took hour and a half to exit stadium!  Worst than when it was Qualcomm stadium with twice as many attendees... what the he'll are they thinking over there!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I was so surprised, when I walked in and heard HER!   I did not read that she was opening for Coldplay.  She was so good!  Then as we walked around the venue, some of my favorite eateries were there!  Crack Shack and Hodads!  I was bummed that I had eaten beforehand.  Coldplay started and they were terrific!  The drone light show wristbands were aesthetically pleasing and they sounded phenomenal.  Travel in and out of the stadium was a piece of cake!  I would definitely return to snapdragon again!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Magic moments, singing out loud, feeling rythm in the heart, tears in my eyes … I turned 50 this year and fulfilled my lifetime dream to see Coldplay. Coming 10k miles to San Diego … saw the Sky full of stars and I am alive again !!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"No doubt about it, this was the best concert I’ve been too. Me and my fiancée are big Coldplay fans and have watched their concerts on TV or Youtube. Being able to experience one of their live concerts exceeded both our expectations. The music, the lights, the vibe, everything was more then we thought being there and present at the show. We’re very lucky they came to our city!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"We went to see Coldplay for the third time in two years at different locations.  They always put on the best show!  So much ""feel good""energy through out the entire evening.  We will be back to see them again!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Took my daughter to her first Coldplay concert and she was absolutely in love with the atmosphere at the snapdragon stadium! Thank you for this wonderful experience!
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"070, H.E.R. And Coldplay was Amazing!!! Coldplay rocked it! The love, the music and the light show were out of this world❤️❤️❤️ Left the concert with a restored faith in Humanity and the belief that anything is possible ."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"My wife and I saw Coldplay at Snapdragon, this being our third show and first for our three kids. Awesome experience from start to finish!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The best concert ever, felt wonderful for the whole family, sople of all ages were enjoying it and it was very uplifting! Not the crazy concert scene from lately."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"It was overall a great experience from start to finish. Breeze to get there with public trolley, I had parked my car earlier in the neighborhood, as I was horrified how traffic home was last time at their concert in 2017 at Qualcomm. From the last song to my home, all in 20 (!!!) minutes! I mean WOW! I had a seat in section 110 row 27 (great for quick and easy access in and out!). And I was able to see the entire lot up stadium - less of the fireworks, but that was ok with me. Friend of mine paid three times more for their tickets (section 104, row 4) which turned out to be the worst seats. They couldn’t see much and were disappointed by the price they paid and what they got in the end.  I suggest NOT to get any row below 15 on the main floor if you want to see anything."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,It was such an enjoyable concert. Very inclusive. It truly felt everyone was sharing a single happy experience in unison. I may have had too much alcohol as well.  But it was a great concert  I’ll do it again!
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I will never forget how amazing the concert was, highly recommend that everyone should experience them live.  There were no flaws, perfect night."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Awesome night.  My girls said it was the best ever! Thank you for the giving them a great memory to share. I am an avid live music fan and the show rivaled with the best shows I have ever attended.  The guys connected with their music and made it personal!  Thank you!
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Great concert experience with the set, lights, fireworks but Chris Martin's voice sounded tired and fatigued.  The voice sounds like he is in pain when he sings.  I saw Coldplay ~11 years ago and his voice was great then and he sounded like his recordings.  Sometimes it's better to space out the concerts on tour to allow the performer to rest the voice instead of cramming in more shows for $.  I think they are a good group though - nice guys and socially responsible."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,When you enter they give you a wrist band that lights up with the concert! Then in your seats you get a great view of the artist. They play with such great energy and are amazing performers!
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay and HER exceeded all,expectations…..what a fabulous night of music.
The other two opening acts were painfully horrible…some rap bad and some very depressed angry woman. Don’t recall the names."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Hands down, best concert I have been to. Bucket list band I’ve always wanted to see. I cried so many times it was just an unforgettable experience."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The pre-opening acts were ok, nothing spectacular, but once H.E.R. started the show, the energy if the place went straight up. She put out a really good show, and this is coming from not a big fan. Coldplay's performance was awesome, full of energy, great music, and fun interaction with the audience. Wristband lighshow was a great addition and fun way for the audience to participate in the show. Overall awesome experience and super fun time!"
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,This was amazing! And Snapdragon Stadium is going to be so successful with having concerts. Chris Martin and the band are outstanding and I can tell genuinely good men.
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,This was the first time I saw Coldplay - although I’ve loved them for years. Wow. I loved every second of their show. and it’s definitely one of my favorite concerts ever. The LED bracelets- amazing - and the dedication to saving the climate is simply incredible and admirable. I LOVED this show.
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I’ve been going to Coldplay concerts since 2005 so I’m a fan, but this is one of their best concerts ever! Chris M’s joy, enthusiasm, and humility are so infectious that you can’t help feeling the same way! They played all their best work, and sprinkled new music here and there. I loved the lit wristbands, the fireworks, and especially the finale with the choir from South Africa. What an amazing show!! I’m already waiting for their new music and next tour."
9/30/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay has been in my bucket list for a while and was finally able to make it to their concert. I gotta say, it was an amazing experience! The show is extremely well produced, so much energy and it's clear they enjoy performing and interacting with the public... Only downside is that the show was a bit short for what I have seen in other concerts, but still worth it!"
9/30/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,I’m tears from the moment the fireworks went off to the very end. An amazing experience I’ll never forget. I wish I could live this concert again ❤️
9/30/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,"I loved seeing Coldplay at Soldier Field. It was my first stadium concert and my first time seeing Coldplay. I loved every second of it. I did NOT sit down. I danced the entire concert, with the exception of going to the bathroom and beer runs. I HIGHLY recommend going to see Coldplay!! They put on a great show. If Coldplay comes to your town GO SEE THEM!!!"
9/30/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,"What can I say, simply amazing!! I first saw Coldplay in 2016 when they came to Indianapolis.  I had such an amazing time, I knew I just had to see them the next chance I got.  Went to see them this year in Chicago at Soldier Field, which by the way was awesome b/c it was open and you had a view of the skyline plus fireworks.   Both tours they give you wristbands that light up to the beats of the songs.  They had kinetic bikes and dance pads so the crowd could use and it that helped provide energy for their shows. They are such awesome performers, great songs, and overall a great group of guys.  If you get the chance, go see them, I promise you won't regret it!"
9/30/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,"Exciting show and entertaining, but it was very obvious those in charge of sound had not gotten out from behind their headphones, because the speaker sound was incredibly bad. I've been to other shows where speakers end up bursting, and this sounded very close to that. Really was a MAJOR distraction to the show."
9/30/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,"I bought a ticket to see Coldplay by myself for their show in Chicago on the 28th of May. I had such a GREAT time that I decided to purchase a ticket for their show on the 29th. I’m glad that I did, this experience was so surreal. Definitely one of the best concerts that I’ve EVER been to"
9/30/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,"The light show was amazing! It was like a big EDM party with lights flashing, pyrotechnics, and Chris Martin's insatiable energy. They played for over 2 hours on 2 stages and Lupe Fiasco joined them to sing 2 songs. Opener H.E.R. seemed off rhythm with her guitar but first opener Drama was an amazing Soul singer. Venue was so-so, but seeing Coldplay for the first time in 20 years was very different than the first 2 smaller venues I saw them at. Good that they're trying to keep up though."
9/27/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay was excellent. We had an amazing time. They didn’t disappoint and the Snapdragon stadium was awesome, as well. Great memories!!!"
9/27/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Everything about seeing Coldplay live is incredible. Their show is truly a show, the lights, the stage setup, the confetti, the wristbands, all of it. Chris Martin is an entertainer and he makes up for the fact that none of the others are. 
Every song they play is a treat for the truest fan or the casual fan who only knows their hits. All n all, it is one of the greatest shows you’ll ever experience….til you see them again."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,We loved this concert. It was extremely stimulating and had a heart felt overtone. It was the best concert ever until we went to U2 at the opening of the sphere the next night. Both concerts by far pushed the bar very high for any other bands. Coldplay must play at the Sphere. I can only imagine how out of this world that would be.
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"1st time seeing them perform and they did not disappoint. I've been to Snapdragon several times to watch SDWaves, but this was my first concert there. It was quite the show. More women's bathrooms are needed at these venues though. It's really horrible at these new venues, that we are still having to wait for so long. You can order food quicker and those lines are also long."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Coldplay puts on an amazing show! Best concert I have ever been to! I would recommend general admission tickets on the floor to be right in the middle of all the excitement. So so fun!
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"At first the song was just ok for me. I hesitate to buy it.
It turns out the best concert ever.
The whole building is the concert. It was super fun.
The day after, radio host say the same thing. He actually didn't like the songs. He got free tickets and the concert becoming the best concert he ever been... i mean.. he went to many concerts, that is his job.."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,This is our 7th time seeing Coldplay. They are the only band that brings together such a diverse audience around the world that come together and absolutely loose it together. Their words are universal and meaningful and their concerts are like a spiritual experience.
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"My inaugural event at Snapdragon and it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to! H.E.R. opened and was incredible! I knew who she was and some of her songs but never paid much attention. I'm a fan now. And she plays crazy instruments. And Coldplay wow! I love Chris Martin. Also the light bracelets were fun. Everything-the opener, the songs, the lights - made for a fun spectacular show."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Chris Martin and Coldplay unmatched by other bands. Great choreography, 
curation, sound and music. Snapdragon? Poorly designed venue with ridiculous lines, high prices and limited redeeming value"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The VIP experience great for having no line to go in and the water bottle at the end. That was all. 
The second day was on the floor. Totally different. Outside, the line was really well organized and we went in fast, once they opened. But I felt like there was too much people on the floor, by the time Coldplay was out, half of the people were drunk already. There were fights all around. When we were there to hear Colplay, it was not supposed to be that kind of concert. I also think that the fact that there were no restrooms on the floor was wrong. We would get lost every time one of us had to go to the restrooms.
The stadium is amazing , the venues, and all. Just these things that made it not all that great"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Excellent performance and Coldplay went over their greatest hits. The visual effects were pretty cool and also the interaction with the crowd was great. Liked the activity of the spheres with the audience.
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Not sure if it was the stadium itself, but at times, it sounded like Chris was off tempo, to include the beginning of the show. I liked Head Full of Dreams better, but it’s always such an incredible experience with the lights, music, audience engagement, and fireworks."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Coldplay put on an amazing show! Saw them at Snapdragon stadium in San Diego. I love their messages to the world ♥️ The bikes and the energy capturing floor is such a cool way to power the concert ♥️♥️
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"If I could experience this every night for the rest of my life, then I’d surely die happy. Watching Coldplay perform was the most amazing experience ever. I highly recommend that anyone that can, please go experience this for yourself."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Best concert I’ve been to along with Taylor Swift. Unimaginable vibes and kind community. Loved their sustainability and kindness and friendliness aspect. They truly deserve the world.
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"To buy the tickets it was really difficult, spent like 2 hrs to update its frozen when it was time to pay and had a hard time. Thank God my boss purchased ours and made the transfer by the app. At the concert it was so difficult to bring the tickets to look for the seats, spent 40 min loading the app and the gpay link to get them"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I took my nephew to see Coldplay for his birthday on the 27th. He was open to going, even though he didn’t know too much about their music.  He left a convert.  Chris Martin was the ultimate entertainer, being amazingly talented and also making such a connection with the crowd.  All the guys seemed to be having a wonderful time- lots of smiles.  They are all such amazing creators and conduits of positive, encouraging music.  The stadium was a clean and well organized venue.  The food and drinks were delicious, and the seats were great.  The venue has a very intimate feel for an arena.  The opening acts were very talented. All-in-all, an experience more wonderful than I imagined."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Incredible experience. Coldplay was amazin and H.E.R. was a breath of fresh air.  Beautiful voice and great shows both!
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"070 Shake was good, H.E.R. Was very good and many folks sang along.  Her more fast and guitar rock pumped the crowd. She could tour as a main event also. But Coldplay gave such an exciting show with dramatic entry, pyrotech, and lighting.  Armbands were fun, but fireworks were awesome.  My family and I will attend another when they return. Thank you!!"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The band and warmup bands were excellent, but the folks at Snapdragon Stadium did not have an orderly system for ridesharing after the concert.  I recommend that there be a more defined place for ride sharing, perhaps more in a corner parking lot.  It took many fans 2-3 hours to catch a ride because of poor labeling for Lyft and Uber, and no smooth entry and exit for drivers."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This is the best concert I have been to so far. The LED bracelets make you feel part of the show, as if you are part of the band. Amazing feeling hearing them live"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I loved this concert so much it was so welcoming to everyone there. It was such a sweet and memorable concert and just a very vibrant and alive, and crowd engaging!"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The staff was more than helpful in every question I had. I had 300 level seats and decided last minute to get floor seats and the website had an issue so I was worried about getting charged without getting the tickets. Thankfully the staff was very reassuring and helped me with the whole situation. Despite not getting floor seats I still had such an amazing time! Friendly staff and the stadium was clean and organized!
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Best day in my life thanks to Coldplay 🫶🌏✨💫💥❤️, a life changing experience simply amazing and magical and thank you ticketmaster for making it possible🙌🏼"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"A great explosion of energy and connection, a great group with an incredible sense of social responsibility. Chris, Guy, Jonny & Will, they are the top 🙌"
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Great concert! The crowd engagement from Chris was fantastic, and the use of drones, lights, and fireworks was great. As usual, merch lines could be better (I honestly don't know why there isn't an express merch option allowing for pre-ordering of merch for pick up at the concert with an express pick up booth by now), but the artists including Coldplay and all their opening acts were really great. It's top 3 concert experiences for me."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This was the best concert I’ve ever attended to! I had a magical experience and I can’t wait to go again! Thank you Coldplay❤️
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Awesomeness at its best, the music, the pyrotechnics, and most importantly the presentation. Wasn’t a fan of big outdoor shows, of course until I saw them perform at the Rose Bowl for the first time during the “A Head Full of Dreams” tour."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The band are phenomenal and put on a show where everyone in the audience feels a part of it. 
Whoever is in charge of the Rose Bowl should be fired. Who sets up one toilet for the women next to 15 men’s toilets?  ( Many women did take over the men’s for this reason.)  Nobody wants to spend time in line for a bathroom…we would all rather spend our time spending money on food and drink (including the guys)…duh!"
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This was hands down the best concert I have ever been to in my life!! Coldplay put on a great show! The night was full of tears and laughter. I sang every song! An experience I'll never forget.
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This concert was AMAZING. The wait was worth every penny. This performance was a celebration of life and music .
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Concert was awesome.  Coldplay never disappoints. The Rose bowl/Pasadena shuttle system for transportation (taxi,uber,etc) was horrible. No one giving directions,  mass of people from all directions filtering into an almost single file. People going around the line. They drop you off in a parking lot again with no directions.   If this is the best they can do, I would avoid this venue."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"We were advised to arrive at the parking lot after it opens at 2:30. Even with a $50 “reserved” parking space, there was no guarantee that a space would be available (reminds me of a Seinfeld episode). Anyway, we arrived at 3:30, got into security line at 5:30, opening acts started at 6:30 AND 7:15. And played until 8:15.
Coldplay didn’t come on until 8:30 and by then, we had already been there for 5 hours. 
Forget about the opening acts. I would have gotten my money’s worth if Coldplay started at 6:30 and finished at 8:30."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,What a crear show! It was magic. I traveled from El Salvador to see my favorite band. Thank you Coldplay for being amazing.
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay was amazing as always. However the crowd control at The Rosebowl is terrible. Chaos, long lines everywhere, apparently some people were in long lines leading no where. Just a mess. There should also be priority parking for people that can do the long walk through the golf course."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The stadium was beautiful but the waiting for hours was a bummer 😔. Lines are to be expected but it was a little unorganized to get in. The concert itself was amazing. My daughter and I flew in from Denver for this concert. I am not disappointed and would do it again. Chris is so welcoming and involves everyone! Very eclectic crowd and such peace.
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,It still feels like a dream that we went to Coldplay. It was a magical experience! Everything from the eco-friendly nature of the concert to hearing those songs live that have gotten me through so many different parts of my life. The thought behind this concert. It truly is a once in a lifetime experience!
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay always gives the best show ever! The lyrics are beautiful and their performance outstanding. Chris connects so good with the audience and we feel like a part of his performance. I also love the way each of their songs tells an unique story along. Please have more shows! I traveled from Houston, TX to Pasadena, CA to attend the show!"
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Best concert ever!!!
From the sound, the light effects, the selection of songs, special effects,  interaction with the audience, charisma, show, how they walk in different spaces so we can have a better view from different perspectives, innovating with smart bracelets for the public that change color according to the songs playing. So the whole audience become part of the show too! Loved that!
It feels like Coldplay really puts all their effort in make the concert audience centered, they think in all the details for every song, their concert its more than just a normal concert, we are experiencing MAGIC IN ALL OUR SENSES! 
Fireworks, everything was PERFECT!!
I am going to go to all their concerts from now and on."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"This concert was out of this world. Loved it from beginning to end. No dull moments. You feel the energy and love all around you. I love the peace that Coldplay brings to the concert. Excellent sound, music, lights and pirotecnia."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Awesome performance by Coldplay. Logistics at Rosebowl were awful. Arrived at 4:30 - prepaid $50 parking. Lots were far out on golf course... no direction on how to get into bowl... waited in a massive line for an hour and 40 minutes. The only people we saw up until gate were parking attendants who just told us to get in line.... getting out of the parking lot after the show was extremely difficult - no signs or attendants telling us which way to exit. Only a couple of exit gates with very long lines of cars. Will think twice about attending a concert at the Bowl. You would think that they would have a system down to deal with large crowds as they have done lots of events for years. Kudos to Coldplay - thumbs down for Bowl!
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Wow! What an amazing performance Coldplay put on! The lighting, effects, wristbands…felt like I was in paradise..paradise! This one will definitely go down as one of the best!! Looove Coldplay."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"They need no introduction. Everytime I see Coldplay in concert, it’s only euphoric. Even better was to watch Selena Gomez pull up on the stage for our show. Out of the world, always leaves me in tears!"
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"If you want the bar for best concert to be set so high that no other show could ever pass or even meet it, then a Coldplay concert is what you need! From the flashing, synchronized bracelets the crowd wears, to the fireworks, balls, lasers, etc. (not to mention the amazing music and incredible talent), you will never see a show as spectacular as this!"
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Never in the ticket purchase did it indicate I would have obstructed view! I was so happy to enjoy this event with 3 of my family members and as we found our seats were super disappointed in the obstruction that was in front of us!
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The couple in front of me were giant, couldn’t see most of the show. I asked security working there if I could change seats but was told they couldn’t help."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,One of the best concerts i have been in my entire existence. Great atmosphere. Amazing show; Chris and the band made everything possible to make an unforgettable experience. I will definitely see them back again.
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"If you haven’t been to a Coldplay concert you have NO idea what you are missing.  I’m 68 years old and go to all kinds of concerts, from bluegrass to opera and everything in between. I have seen 
many great concerts in my life but if I had to choose only one concert to go to it would be Coldplay. Musically, visually, culturally few things come close.  Absolutely fantastic.  I’ve seen them twice and would gladly see them again."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Amazing once in a lifetime experience! Everyone exquisite from start to finish and the added surprise appearance by Selena Gomez was beyond words. I traveled from North Carolina for this performance and will never forget this night. Colplay is truly part of my heart and soul. Impeccable!!
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,By far the BEST CONCERT EVER hands down this year. I've gone to about 9 different concerts throughout 2023 and this one was so much fun! It was awesome that every single person in the stadium was happy and singing along and even dancing together for the love we have not only for Coldplay but their music. Only downside was the waiting in line the usual hassles but other than that it was an AMAZING EXPERIENCE. AND SELENA GOMEZ WAS A SURPRISE GUEST LIKE SHDHSJDBDHKS
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"My friend and I are besides ourselves post this concert experience. Coldplay spared no expense. We were GA on the floor and had absolutely the greatest time ever ! 
The parking situation and getting to the concert was disastrous. It took us 3 hours and we were coming from Manhattan beach. Despite us having booked a parking spot, it was a cluster mess. And crowd control at the entrance gate was atrocious with people cutting in, you don’t know where the line begins or ends, standing in lines that lead to nowhere! Definitely something the stadium should look to better regulate. It was quite frustrating."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,We traveled from Michigan for this event and it was worth every penny. It was magical…. Coldplay made us feel a part of their show and seemingly so grateful for their fans. It was truly such an amazing experience and hope to one day see them again. The absolute best show I’ve ever been to!
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"It was such a magical night, truly amazing how the band think about the details, the lights, but the most important of all the message they deliver, the message of love and unity.

It was my third concert of Coldplay but certainly not the last, I love the whole experience of watching and listen them."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"No doubt Coldplay is one of the best shows I have seen. I just wish it would have been in another venue. This football field is not meant for concerts, it is huge so it makes it difficult to set a stage where you can actually see the artist. The parking is basically dirt, even though they filled it with white pebbles it is dirt, white powder everywhere so if you have allergies, BEWARE!
They charge 64 dlls online for parking, and when you arrive; if you thought you had an early access or different parking from the people that did not purchase it ahead of time, let me tell you; everybody went into the same parking. 
I don’t think I will come back to any event at this venue."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay is a concert you HAVE to experience if possible. The lights and sound is amazing, not to mention how personal they make their shows. They engage with the audience so well that it makes the experience so much better. 10/10!"
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The energy and passion of the band (Chris!) and engagement with the audience made for another wonderful concert from Coldplay. MAGICAL! I would go to every concert if it was possible but this is around #10 for me. It’s soul touching every time. Thank you for another memorable night. One that I now get to bring my kids along for and create diehard fans of them too.
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,I have to say this has been the best concert that I have attended. I had so much fun and it was just a good performance . Coldplay definitely puts in a show. Worth the price.
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,My partner and I travel from Eel Ground NB  Canada to San Diego to see Coldplay .. It was a unbelievable concert .. Snapdragon stadium is set up so nice for concerts .. Thank you Coldplay for a existence of a lifetime
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Attended a Coldplay concert via Ticketmaster; straightforward purchase with timely updates. Faced a brief e-ticket delay, but it was quickly resolved. Reliable for event tickets. Four stars."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Have. Even waiting years to see Coldplay and it did not disappoint.  Coldplay puts on an incredible stadium show but somehow makes it intimate.  The lights and effects made it seem like a real event to witness,  they played most of the their hits and some new favorites from the newest album.  Took my daughter and a friend and they were equally as wowed.  Cannot recommend more!"
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Must LIVE it in order for you to experience this Spectacular, Unforgetable, and Memorable concert. The band connects with you on an intimate level and leave feeling special but amazing! Coldplay knows how to do concerts right and they will raise the bar on concert experience!"
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay is always fun and amazing. It’s like attending a huge bash with thousands of smiling people. Super fun.
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,So much energy from everyone the braclet light show and every thing was energy saving and the proceeds go to save our planet I can go on and on
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Didn’t really think I liked Coldplay. Went to see HER.  HER was sheer perfection. I was content. Then Coldplay started!!!!  WOW!  What an experience!  They give and give. Chris Martin leaves it all on the stage. 💯
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Magical ! exceptional ! When the concert begins you bust into tears so much love and good vibes ! Best concert ever !
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"the two opening acts before h.e.r. and coldplay the group of rappers were okay. the singer in the second act was pathetic . sounded totally out of it. h.e.r. was a class act. great singer/ musician.  coldplay was an exciting and delightful experience.  loved the light effects.  Chris Martin and the group were there to put on a fantastic show/performance and they delivered. the rose bowl is not a great venue. long lines to get in, get food and get out after the performance.  the ""stairs""are way too steep for anyone not in top physical condition."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The concert was amazing and Coldplay is a band I gave always wanted to see. Only complaint was the parking venue. Definitely no organization and a mess to get out. I will not be going to Rose Bowl for a loong looooong time.
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,I was blown away at the Coldplay concert! They really know how to put on a show! The bracelets everyone had that lit up the stadium was magical. What a beautiful experience. Certainly not to be missed if you love their music. A must see.
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Enjoyed the show but after paying $43 to park in the grass and then waiting over an hour to exit the stadium afterwards due to lack of traffic enforcement, the experience was pretty much miserable!! I will never attend another concert at this Venue."
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Synchronization, sound . Lighting, performance and security were amazing.Very well organized and very calm environment that lead to the most enjoyable experience, I really wanted that lasted longer!!"
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The moment Coldplay steps foot on stage the communion starts 50 thousands souls are on the same beat the same tempo like a couple that finishes each other sentences Chris can sing a few bars but the audience could finish any song along with him .
This moment of eternity everybody will take it home and feel good for days to come . 
Every time I have seen Coldplay live I go back home wishing for our next meeting dreaming of how good they make me feel inside and wanting more how many artists can say that about themselves? Well at least the members of this formation can say it about themselves without sounding conceited because I said it for them and they can quote me ."
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Beautiful music. Spectacular light show. They made everyone feel like we were special and meaningfully thanked us for being there and I gotta say it was hot meaning temperature and how Chris loved Tampa’s Pirate ship and even sang a corny song about it ! Thank you Coldplay you were amazing.
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This was my 10th COLDPLAY concert!  First one being in 2002 at The Bowery in NYC!  I was a fan of theirs when I first heard them on the radio living in Amsterdam in 1999!  Fell in love with Chris Martin's voice from the first note he sang. Was SO EXCITED to hear that they were actually going to tour the USA as I was back home in 2000. Haven't missed a tour ever since. Sometimes seeing them twice during a tour. Like this time. I was working in Philly and bought tickets then was back in Tampa when they were there!  The band NEVER disappoints!  You leave having your heart and soul filled with love and joy that's lasts a whole year!!!  Hope to see them in Europe as that is a bucket item for me. Thank you Chris, Guy, Will and Jonny for encouraging your fans to put love and joy into the world and allowing us to be your vehicles for doing so. 💕"
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,It was amazing!!! Loved the band and his show! They are unbelievable!  I was so near to Chris and he is so kind and human!  I can’t wait for them to come back!  Best show ever!!!
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Totally Epic Concert so much fun and interactive - the best I’ve been to in ages! Loved the idea of the crowds dancing powering the concerts.
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,One of the best experiences I’ve ever had. Such good vibes in the audience and from Coldplay. Live singing was amazing and sounded better then expected. One should go experience them live once in their life. Can’t wait to see them again.
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The concert was so amazing. With the exception of a few words, it was very family friendly, entertaining, and just fun.  The visuals were off the charts."
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Our first concert was in Miami on 2017, was amazing. In 2022 we went to Tampa and we enjoy a great time with them in concert  Beautiful concert 🎵 love ! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The concert is so worth it! The band gave it all and people felt it. Every song they played, they nailed it! Even the performance of “Her” is amazing! The organizers and merchandises are so-so but it was peaceful overall so Kudos to everybody!"
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It’s one of the best shows I’ve been to in the past 5 years. The location was accessible, lots of parking available. Entrance was easy. They provided hand bands that lit up during the show, and bikes to create kinetic energy to produce future shows. The concert set list was brilliant, performance was out of this world, I enjoyed every second of it."
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,I tour with a band all summer and have for many years. Not once has there been anything like what Coldplay does! Incredible!!
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,It was phenomenal! I only suggest more help to helping attendees finding their seats and better parking situations.
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Worth flying 3 hour to Tampa concert,is my second concert of Coldplay in this 2022 tour ,both out of the league!!planing my third concert very soon."
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I’ve worked for live nation for 10 years as well as been to 100’s if not 1000’s of shows on my own; Coldplay was by far the best show yet! It was like if Blueman group sponsored the show. Fireworks, Confetti, light up wristbands controlled by the LD, spectacular light show, crowd singing at max volume, exercise bikes that power the stages and most importantly that amazing voice of Chris Martin. It was everything I hoped it would be and more!! Also, the opener HER is a badass. If you find yourself at a Coldplay show make sure you take the time to watch her set. She might be the headliner in the near future."
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Five years was too long without a Coldplay concert! The band sounds as good as ever, and continues to be on one the best live acts touring. Great mix of new and classic hits made for yet another amazing concert experience."
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Stadium staff lost, no one help with information to the public. my strap was damage,  sound not good, but the show is amazing"
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,I don’t have enough words to describe the experience. I was there with my daughters and wife. We loved it.
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Had the best time!   Such a feel good band. Interactive and fun! Could feel the energy and the excitement. 2nd time seeing them.  So worth the trip to Tampa!  The whole audience was singing and dancing.  Didn’t sit down once!
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I loved the concert! I mean who doesn't!! BUT the amount of time waited for the band to play was atrocious. The show was supposed to start at 7pm, it actually started at 7:50-8:10, and Coldplay came out around 9:20 for an hour show. It was way too much wait and that got a little disheartening. 

Aside from that, Coldplay knows how to put a show. ❤️"
9/23/23,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Absolutely amazing experience, seen Coldplay twice in Glasgow, but this was all together on a different plain!"
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Love the bracelet that synced with the music. Love the ambiance and how everything was organized! Special guest were awesome. One of the best experiences I had!!
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Out of this world! The love pours out of the entire band. The positive vibes start the moment they step on stage and doesn’t end. They send you home feeling like you just experienced living in a rainbow of light!
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay put on a great show. Would love to see them again. The venue could use lots of improvement. I realize it’s old. But the parking and entry. Could use lots of improvements. Including the seats. Restrooms. Time it takes to drive out. Everything about Coldplay was great.
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I purchased my ticket in February 2023, paid a lot of money to get a good seat with a view, then got to my seat on the night of the event, only to be blocked by the band's equipment, which was set up right in front of my section 10, Row k, Seat 1. My friend spent an hour at customer service getting the seats changed, missing both warm up bands.

The whole section was upset that good money was spent on the tickets only to be blocked by the equipment.  Why wasn't the section blocked off? The customer service person even had a printout that highlighted our section, seems they knew about it. 

We were eventually moved.
 
Also, when we were leaving the Rose Bowl, there were signs that no ride shares available, which was how we got there, instead we had to be shuttled to another location to pick up a ride share. We had no prior notice and would have made other arrangements to get back to our hotel. The lines to get on the shuttles were outrageous and no one seemed to be aware until they also left the stadium.  We made the decision to walk back to our hotel, about an hour, arriving well past midnight. 

Why in the world is there no public transportation to and from the stadium, even if the drop off location is up the hill? Horrible planning!

I will not attend another event at the Rose Bowl and will not recommend anyone else go there."
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Amazing music and magical concert!  My favorite concert I have ever been to!  Highly recommend.  Sean Martin really cares about his fans and the people who help him with his entire production.  I go to a lot of concerts and I have never seen credits ran at the end thanking everyone.
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The actual concert was excellent. Coldplay has one of the best shows truly talented and great performers. The long lines to get in through the gates were very unorganized. 
What happened to the bucket seats at the stadium? 
People we're sitting way to close to one another on the very uncomfortable metal benches. 
Same concert at the same location in 2018 was much more organized."
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The best concert I’ve seen thus far!!! Can’t wait to go see them again!!!! H.E.R was a bonus and Selena was a great surprise!
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"It was an amazing show, the lighted wristbands really kept eve song electric and amazingly great to dance and sing to!"
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Loved the show! It was one of the best concerts  I’ve been to, the lights, the balloons, the crowd! Overall a great show!"
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The best concert ive ever been to. Chris & the band put on an amazing show & we even got to see a performance with Selena Gomez & HER. Need to see them again.
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The show was amazing, couldn’t have ask for a better show to be honest, the sound was great and the crowd was alive the whole time. The only down will be the parking in and out situation other than that everything was smooth and amazing, am still having day dreams about the show"
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"One of the best concerts I have ever been to. Such an amazing experience! I had seen videos and photos of the tour in other locations, but to be there, immersed in the music and lights… Absolutely fantastic."
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I’ve been a Coldplay fan since I was a teenager and I’ve been multiple concerts, including one Coldplay concert back in 2017. Coldplay does an AMAZING show! I thought the last tour I went to wasn’t going to be beat but the MOTS tour was just as amazing and even better! I loved every minute of it. I did get the VIP tickets and it was 100% worth it! If you haven’t seen them in concert, do yourself a favor and go see them! Their performance was so wholesome and magical! I can’t wait to see them again in the future! Thank you so much to everyone who worked at the Rose Bowl, the crew who work behind Coldplay and of course, Coldplay themselves (Chris, Johnny, Guy, and Will). You guys made my night/year. All love to you ❤️"
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This concert was beyond amazing!! The show was constantly keeping people so engaged!! I loved that it was for all age groups!! From the youngest fans to the various aged adults! It was like a live light show with laser beams all over the place!! I would definitely recommend going to their concert!! All songs sounded AMAZING !! I was lucky to have been able to share the experience with my daughter!! Making lifelong memories together!!!💕💕💕💕
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"That was an experience, not a concert! Coldplay sounds radiated through stadium 🏟️ with 67k fans. The bracelets lit up w music 🎶, part of the experience! Themed aliens 👽 , we are all aliens from somewhere. Music 🎶 of the Spheres 🛸🚀🌠🌌🌎 my side passion of astronomy and aliens. Perfect night. Drove 3,500 miles, 10 states round trip to see!"
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,One of the best concerts EVER!!! Positive Vibes only!  Love was in the air! Very interactive and amazing concert!!!  A must see in person experience!
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I am a Coldplay fan; not die hard but definitely a fan. I was fortunate enough to see Coldplay a long time ago and thought they were one of the best concerts I have seen. This time at the Rose Bowl it was not a concert but an experience. The energy from the stage and around the bowl itself was simply unexplainable. The lights, sound, song selection were second to none. Even with everybody singing every word of every song, you could clearly still hear the band. I have to say the light up/ interactive wristbands were really a great addition. I cannot wait to see them again on the next tour."
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Has a blast and my son was able to experience his first live concert with all the lights and bells he was expecting and more so
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I really loved every second of this show!! Coldplay as band really gives they’re best while performing, interacting and connecting with everyone in the stadium. They really put an amazing show!!!

My only complaint is the facilities in general. The organization at Rose bowl is awful, the 2 times I had the opportunity to be there the whole organization at the stadium is a mess!! the parking, the entrance, the acces to floor spaces… I really hope that the next time that Coldplay have the opportunity to be at LA area they pick another venue like the SoFi"
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,I had the best time I will never forget this concert this was my first time seeing them and I am truly speechless. The little LED bracelets they give you when you walk in really make you a part of the show and they keep you into it will the transitions and just everything the vibe and the lights are amazing can’t wait to go again.
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay was AMAZING as always. The venue in the other hand has room for improvement. It was sold out. And every row was literally shoulder to shoulder. The bleacher seating just doesn’t have adequate space. Worst than airplanes!
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Recently went to my first coldplay concert at the Rosebowl. The show was mesmerizing and now I'm contemplating of flying overseas just to live in that moment again!
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Great show but completely uncomfortable in the bleachers. The Rose Bowl really should space out those seats. I'm a size 2 but everyone around me was at least a 12 (women) and the men were at the very least large. I actually stood sideways to watch the show, until I stood on the bleacher seat since I had nowhere else to stand. Nuts. 

The how itself was fantastic. Coldplay is better than ever, and HER got to show everyone that she has an amazing future ahead."
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The concern was really amazing!!! From the beginning to the end. I jumped, screamed, cried and singed until I lost my voice."
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Production was great. The band was awesome! They sounded just as they do on their tracks and everything about their performance was as expected. Super fun, colorful and special."
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"This was the most amazing show, and I couldn’t have asked for a better venue, the only thing that I felt needed improvement was the parking. It took my family and I almost 2 hours just to exit the venue, so if they could figure out a better way to exit It would definitely make a five-star experience."
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Chris Martin is such a humble entertainer.   He called someone from the audience and announce it that he can sing well.  What an understatement for himself.   The show has everything  from laser show, fireworks, confettis, giant balloons, and color controlled bracelets.   Coldplay shows is always magnificent! Definitely will go again when they come back in town"
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Rose bowl was disorganized chaos. Nobody knew where to go or what to do. No cones no directions. What a mess
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This was my first ever Coldplay concert even though I’ve been a fan since 2000. But the entire experience once we finally got into the stadium was incredible. Loved the wrist bands they handed out and loved the synchronicity of lights to the specific songs. Would definitely come back next time. I just hope next time the venue does a better job at managing the lines and having more guidance as to where to line up to enter.
9/23/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"It was an unforgettable experience. The Music of Spheres tour setlist was fantastic, featuring their iconic hits and some newer tracks. Coldplay's energy on stage was infectious, and the visual effects and showmanship were truly remarkable. I was captivated from start to finish. I can't wait to attend every Coldplay concert in the future; they never disappoint!"
7/17/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,More than 5 stars for this concert. I think it was one of the best Coldplay concert I have ever seen in my life. Everything was perfect and very organized. Thank Coldplay and Ticketmaster for making this concert posible.
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,The light show with the arm wrists was unbelievable and the songs they chose amazing. Definitely will see them again
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"VIP Lounge was much nicer than I imagined.  Staff was attentive, hor d'oeuvre's were excellent, no pigs in a blanket, but shrimp, endive and creme freche, etc... we could go anywhere in the stadium we wanted to, bar staff was friendly, and the whole experience was pretty awesome.  Meeting the band would have been better, but..."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Great show! My group enjoyed being in the GA seating. We did need help during the show so we texted the help line. No response or help was given. The event was very hot so fans would of been great.  Coldplay was amazing.
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The show itself was great. 
A few things soured the experience: 
1. There was only junk food to choose from at the venue. Not a single apple or banana were available. 
2. The sound at the show was bad, I could hardly make out the words I know by heart. 
3. The long lines to board the trains at the end of the show took forever. 

Other than that, Coldplay are the best show!"
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The only other concert that compares was the Coldplay concert I went to in 2017! SO AMAZING.
Band sounded stunning and of course the visuals were out of this world! The light up bracelets really make the stadium breathtaking. A must see!"
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"what an absolute banger of a show.  even the $20 tickets wayyyyy up and to the side were an awesome experience.  it was like a giant stadium-sized party.  Chris Martin is adorable, Bruce Springsteen was the best possible surprise and I will never shut up about this."
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,This performance was amazing i loved everything about it and the visual effects got better and better each song. I will be going to the next coldplay concert any and everytime they perform.!
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,This was my first time seeing Coldplay and they exceeded any expectations that I had!! Such a diverse crowd which really shows how they can connect with all audiences. Absolutely will see them again!!!
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I’ve been a longtime fan of Coldplay and have always wanted to see them live.

They put on one hell of a show.

The energy in the stadium is unreal and out of this world. The band sounds fantastic live. They pour their love into their shows and send it out into the crowd and the world.

Thank you for the best concert experience I’ve ever had. Looking forward to many more with Coldplay."
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"My 11 year old son, wife & I went to see Coldplay. It was an out of body experience. To the extent that every time I play videos from that night, I get teary eyed. The world would be a better place with more Chris Martin's in it. Thank you for providing such positive vibrations to everyone at the stadium.

God bless you :)"
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I will forever be thinking about this concert. It was truly a dream come true to see Coldplay, and to finally have them a few feet away was absolutely incredible. I can’t wait to see them again one day, just phenomenal! I really cried."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Hi. I live in Honduras, Central America.
 ticketmaster app is not available for latinamerica  so create confusion to get the tickets. I knew that the app is available for Mexico so I don´t know if it work fine for all countries in latinamerica."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The concert on June 14, 2022, was my first Coldplay concert and it did not disappoint!  The band had incredible energy from the start to the end!  They performed fan favorites (e.g., Sparks, Clocks, Hymn for the Weekend) as well as songs from the Music of the Spheres.  They rocked People of the Pride!  H.E.R. joined Chris for Let Somebody Go - phenomenal duet!  I hope Coldplay continues performing for many years, because I want to see them in concert again!  #ColdplayTampa"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Aside from the usual save the world lectures and propaganda films , this was a visual and musical tour de force. Definitely top 5 concerts I've ever attended."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay put on the most amazing concert I have ever been to, hands down. The energy, the mix of old and new songs, the LIGHTS! Everything was absolutely perfect. I can’t think of one bad thing to say, I will never forget that night! If you have the chance to see them, do it! Again and again."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay never disappoints!! This was a special show for us as it was my son’s first Coldplay show! The music was amazing, and Coldplay fans are all so loving and supportive which makes for such a wonderful vibe! So proud of Coldplay for all of their sustainable initiatives on this tour as well. We had a great time riding the bikes and dancing on the kinetic floors to help power the C stage for the next show! We will always cherish our time together rocking out with Coldplay! Just wish they had another show in our area to see them again!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,John Williams! a packed crowd! An original song just for Tampa Bay! Fireworks! The wave! Viva La Vida! Sky Full of Stars! My Universe! Higher Power! All in one package!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,This was an amazing concert you couldfeel the beams in the stadium flexing from all the dancing and jumping. The light show was phenomenal! Glad we went!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It was exciting to be a part of the all positive energy that Coldplay brought to the stage from beginning to the end! I loved being a part of the show, from the wrist bands, the beautiful colorful balls, entire stadium singing with every song! Spectacular light and fireworks show! 
One of the most memorable concerts of my lifetime!
Thank you Coldplay for supporting Ocean Cleanup and reforestation, many thanks for sharing!
A side note, we were treated so kindly by all stadium personal, from the concession people to the greeters coming and going! Great experience for sure!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,The venue was great! Nice seats. The  food/drinks area had AC and bathrooms were super clean. The concert was amazing.. I love how interactive it was.. the energy was great! Loved it.
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"If there is a better show anywhere, I’d like to know about it. Wow! What an amazing night. Just can’t imagine there is a better stadium show….anywhere."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,This concert was epic and easily the best concert I’ve ever been to. The concert was interactive and so much fun. They played for 2 and some hours. The crowd was awesome. We were all still singing walking out of the stadium!  It felt like we all knew each other. I look forward to being able to see them again.
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"There is not enough words to describe how amazing was the concert, all the lights, how the band performed it was just I N C R E D I B L E 10/10"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"While the production of Coldplay was excellent with there sound, light and firework display, H.E.R left us holding our ears. Some people may like to be screamed at, we prefer hearing the melody and words. The male lead singer of the band was pleasant to listen to."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"From the first seconds until the last Chris Martin and band blew the minds of everyone there. A stadium filled with love, electricity, kindness, and music. A night to not be forgotten."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It has always been a lifelong dream to see Coldplay live. This concert exceeded all of my expectations completely!! They are so genuine and talented and put on such a captivating, lively show. FANTASTIC!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Traffic to get to the stadium, was terrible, but once I got there, getting in was fast and easy. They allowed me to bring in my camera too. I was very happy about that. It was a beautiful  show, with amazing special effects. An inspiring message to the world about conservation, peace, and love."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Always the best concerts by Coldplay! Amazing on every level! Chris Martin rocked the Buccs stadium to its core!! Thanks for giving all of your fans such a special show!!!!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,The music was fantastic but the added lighting effect brought the concert way over the top.  It was very obvious that Cold Play was there to put on a great show and really care about the people. This is an event that has set a new standard for me.
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Loved. Loved. Loved the show. Coldplay puts their heart into every song. The stage set was unreal and the lighted bracelets made every single person in that stadium feel like they played a part. SO happy I saw this show!!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Took my husband for his birthday. This was the best concert that I have ever been to! He shared that same sentiment. Both artists were absolutely amazing and Coldplay put on an amazing show. The stadium was full and the crowd completely interactive. There was an educational element with regards to preservation that was amazing as well!!! The lighted wristbands were awesome and genius!!! My husband was the Coldplay fan coming into the concert. We were both fans of both artists by the end of the concert!!!
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Absolutely loved Coldplay. They never disappoint. From the tremendous energy to the light up wrist bands coordinated to music; it was great. The one minor complaint would be that there was an echo from the back speakers. It wasn't noticeable all the time, but it was there. The venue was also great."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The general seating layout was horrible, everyone was crammed in and it was 95 degrees outside, folks were passing out given how crammed it was. I would suggest Coldplay rethink their seething arrangements."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I loved everything about the concert, although there were some songs I would have loved for Coldplay to play that they didn't, but I understand... Regardless of that, it was still a beautiful experience and the best concert I've ever been to.

BUT, the only thing I didn't like was how the venue was not prepared with the things Coldplay said it was going to do like for example having free aluminum cups with ice (heck, I would have still payed for it to be honest) and various water stations for people to get water... We weren't allowed to bring any type of water bottles inside, so we had to buy a $7 regular plastic water bottle just so that we could stay hydrated during the concert, and get this, they didn't give us the bottle cap because now they wanted to be green even though there was already a solution for that with the aluminum cups. And the whole thing about the bottle caps was weird and inconsistent because some people did have their caps with their bottles."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Imagine a place filled with thousands of beautiful people from all nations and colors, all genders and ages, all of them having fun and living harmoniously. People are celebrating life, treating each other with respect, equanimity, and enjoying the universal religion: Music! singing and dancing freely and joyfully. 

Well that Tuesday summer full moon night in the Tampa Buccaneer's Stadium with Coldplay was just that!
  
There was so much creativity, love and consciousness in this ritual for healing the earth!

A truly magical night full of fun, conscious awakening and gratitude from this MASTER ARTISTS they are a true inspiration and blessing to this precious planet!

Coldplay is not just a band it is a catalyst for the change our planet needs to thrive ❤️🌎🌚🌝

May all beings experience such joy and awaken to their true nature.

Om Ah Hum"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,This was the best Tuesday night of my life!   The amazing show given by Coldplay is beyond description.

Thank you Coldplay for the memories !!!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay never disappoints! From their stand-alone pre-show performers, to their own high-energy music, we always love seeing Coldplay!!!! VIP was a blast, and lover the water bottle merch! Miss you already!!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Second time we have seen Coldplay and another incredible concert. This show from beginning to end was off the chain. Any effort you make to see them in Concert is well worth it.
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I loved the energy of Chris Martin and Coldplay band.. they had light bracelets for the audience participation, which made it fun! Fireworks and wonderful choice of songs throughout the evening.. the venue is nice too!"
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I’m so happy I got to experience such an amazing show with my daughter, son  and husband! Coldplay show, music, lyrics, effects, lighting, fireworks, positive message and energy, everything was simply dreamy. To top it all off the opening shows Bea Miller, H.E.R. and Bruce Springsteen as a surprise guest!!! Unforgettable experience!!!"
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"There are not enough words to explain how amazing this concert was. Coldplay is always about good music, love, respect and most importantly having fun! Can't wait till they tour again."
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"ColdPlay was Awesome. Chris Martin had so much energy. The balloons, confetti, wristband lights, the multiple stages. And Bruce Springsteen topped the night. The family has a incredible time."
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,Loved all of the new eco friendly changes at the stadium! Everything was very clean. Concert was incredible.
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I’ve been to a lot of concerts and this was by far my favorite and blew me away. Being on the floor made all the difference. Cannot recommend enough!
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"it was such a wonderful show. my friend and i drove 6.5 hours to see them, and it was more than worth it. wonderful visuals, wonderful music, wonderful band. 10/10 would see them again!!!"
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I’ve been waiting years to see Coldplay and this show was everything I’d hope it would be and more. Can’t wait to see them again someday.
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Coldplay’s performance at the MetLife Stadium in NJ on June 5th was phenomenal. The interaction between Chris Martin and the audience was uplifting and genuine. Their music gave us a moment in time that we were able to enjoy & appreciate their music. The fireworks, laser lights, and light up wristbands added to the spectacular performance. The images of hearts created with illumination of red wristbands reminded everyone to value and share love. In a world full of uneasiness it was a night to escape the worries of the world and be at peace. Chris Martin’s positive messages and energy was uplifting. The best concert I have attended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Seats were great, Coldplay is amazing. Great concert, Bruce was a bonus as I looked for my vehicle...lol"
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The Coldplay show was absolutely amazing!  The songs were wonderful, as always, but the experience was incredible!  Coldplay shows always make you feel more hopeful, optimistic, and overall filled with 
joy when you leave. As a venue, MetLife was awesome!  They let GA in a bit early and we’re very polite in sectioning us out and having us go down to the floor in small groups so no one was running. GREAT show, GREAT venue, GREAT fans!!"
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The Coldplay concert was well worth attending.  It was an entertaining event.  The two acts preceding the main event were all right.  
My husband and I hope to attend future concerts as long as they keep touring."
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I saw videos of them perform in 2017 and was like “I gotta see them next time they tour” and I saw them at Met Life in NJ, and omg. They were amazing with all their hits and great new ones from Music of the spheres. The energy and visuals were insane even from high up. Everyone should see them."
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The organization of the concert left a mostly positive impression, except navigating in the stadium itself - finding our seats turned out to be a challenge, signs, and markings were not very helpful, but the staff helped us. The music and the show itself were amazing."
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"After a never ending pandemic, I never thought I would have a chance to fulfill my long standing dream to see Coldplay.  The band gave it their all on Sunday night at Met Life Stadium.  The sheer energy shown by Chris Martin blows me away.  Coldplay’s music and feeling of the concert was uplifting, positive and a nod to our collective human-ness, our need to connect and for taking in and sharing love back to the world.  

Simply an en amazing concert and experience.  Thank you to Coldplay, it’s crew and the venue, and my fellow concert goers for making this a once in a lifetime dream come true."
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"They had an amazing performance, had the crowed going the entire show, amazing light show and fireworks. Chris is a very heartfelt person, Loved every second of it, without a doubt I will go to another tour if they have another one. First time seeing them and definitely not the last!! Bravo!"
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"What a great show! Amazing all around experience with great music, light show, fireworks, and more. seeing Coldplay is a must!"
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,One of the best concerts of my life! I will see again as soon as possible!
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I've been to my fair share of concerts over the years, and this ranks among the best ever. Phenomenal experience all around, from the artistry to the lighting to the pyrotechnics. You can tell Coldplay pour everything into it and want their fans to have the best time ever. Just mind blowing, really."
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,My dentist also went with her family and her kids said it was fantastic. I think that the show was great and then Bruce showed up at the end to put the icing on the cake! I think we all wish we had the energy Chris displayed on the stage.
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,While I've always been a fan of Coldplay this was the first time I saw them live and it won't be the last.  From the beautiful stage to all the attention to detail to making this an eco-friendly production. Also they couldn't have picked a better set list.  They played all the favorites.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The concert was the most amazing night!! Insane performances, best songs, cool vibes, and amazing special effects!! I love them so much and it was my 1st concert with them and there was not ont one moment where I was not loving it!! So special ♥️ Thank you Coldplay, you were aMaZiNg and you did not disappoint!! 💙🤍💚🧡"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"First the venue was awesome… Mercedes Benz in Atlanta was full and open and Just a great space. 
COLDPLAY was on point and killed butt. They had a great vibe with the crowd…singing with us and just kicking it. BEST CONCERT OF 2022!!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Wow!!!  Coldplay were absolutely amazing!!  The lights, the fireworks, the sound, the interaction was incredible.  Please tour the south again- ATL, North Florida area!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,it's not a concert. it's a once in a lifetime experience that makes everything going on in the world disappear totally if only for just a few hours. would go 1 million more times if i could. would follow them around the world if i could!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Never a bad show. Worth every penny, and most definitely an experience. Fun, energetic, visually and audibly vibrant. Awesome night"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,First ever Coldplay concert! It was amazing! The wristbands you wear for the extra lights was super fun as well as offering to dance or bike to help power the stage! The music quality was excellent (and loud) The only downside was trying to get an Uber or Lyft ride back to the hotel. They may wanna offer something in the future to make getting a ride a little more easier for travelers/tourists but that isn’t directly a concert issue I know lol
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"A Coldplay show isn't a concert; it's a full experience. If you ever get the chance to see them, do it! You'll get all the feels and probably a good workout in the process."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Absolutely amazing show! I have been wanting to see them since I was 12 and finally got the chance to. They exceeded my expectations as artists, musicians and humans in general. They have a huge heart and I love that they use their platform to help those in need and for our planet as well 💙 Would love to see them again soon!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I waited for two years for Cold Play to come to America, and better to my City of Atlanta. The performance was all that. The sound was perfect, the band was on point, and the interaction with the audience was invigorating. If you love music please see this band."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Probably the best concert we’ve ever attended!  Coldplay put on an amazing show - can’t imagine it any better.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Doors did not open on time (5:30) so people were standing in the hot sun for an extra LONG time. Once inside (that process was smooth with easy security walk-through detectors and ticket scanning kiosks) the  venue provided excellent food options with wonderful low price-points ($2 popcorn!) Mariah the Scientist impressed with her effortless vocal range and H.E.R. wowed us her range of instruments and talent. At some point as the sun was about to set the roof was opened and we all enjoyed watching an impressive display of modern engineering-and welcomed fresh air. I’ll be honest-I must be getting old to say this-I feel like it was a bit too loud. Especially the openers (do they have to be as loud?) It felt like a volume for an outdoor arena but other than the hole at the top, we were definitely indoors. I saw a lot of people wincing at first. Anyway…around 9:00, just after sundown, Coldplay was introduced by a sweet family (apparently they had sent an email thanking the band for including the hearing impaired and we’re contacted to do this 🥰) The band entered and our bracelets we were given at entry started lighting up…amazing! The energy from the crowd was electric. The set was the same as the previous show with the exception of Independent Women with Kelly Rowland. The band stopped singing Sky Full of Stars to ask us to put our phones away and enjoy this one song together, saying that coming to Atlanta felt like Christmas to the band. It was a special energy created-everyone was UP! Overall a terrific set list of old and new. The lights, the confetti, the big screens, the band giving it their ALL for 2 hours…a great show. Chris must have some serious cardio training! My personal highlights were Adventure of a Lifetime, Viva la Vida (the audience singing with them) and Sparks. I love this band dearly so I say with love that the singing of Something Just Like This wearing an alien head doing sign language was puzzling but then topped later by a muppet, yes an actual muppet, singing Biutyful with Chris. No one knew what to do with that. 
So overall definitely worth the money and the 40 minutes getting out of the parking deck at 12:30am. I should note that the line for Uber/Lyft was daunting. Hundreds of people just standing by the curb. Now I must re-watch all my videos and try not to be sad it’s over."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Best concert I have ever been to! Loved being at the Mercedes Benz stadium it was beautiful! The show was spectacular with Chris Martin being very entertaining and genuinely enjoying himself! I would definitely recommend going to the concert! You will not regret it!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,One of the best concerts I have seen. We were sitting in the second row of the upper deck but felt like we were part of the concert
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Easily one of the best concerts I have ever seen, and I’ve seen a lot of concerts. Coldplay was so much fun to watch and the entire show was an uplifting experience. Chris sounded great, as well as the rest of the band. Coldplay and myself are both huge fans of U2, and I certainly felt their influence on Coldplay’s show. Just incredible."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,The Coldplay concert in ATL was exceptional!  They put on the best concert I have seen over the years.  The crowd was very much into the show and it made the experience that much better.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,H.E.R. and Coldplay were great!  Loved loved loved the wristbands Coldplay lit up during their performance.  Super cute when the wristbands were yellow during the “Yellow” song.  The 4 star rating is not a reflection of how I felt about Coldplay.  It’s due to the poor sound quality that I attribute to echoing in the Mercedes Benz Stadium.  Once they opened the roof the sound was much better.  I expected better from a new stadium.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Getting in and out was easy. The venue was well air conditioned. The sound was very good. Coldplay put on an incredible show!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The show was amazing!  The opened dome, lighting, pyrotechnics, wristbands, and ENEGRY made for such a fun concert!  Coldplay played a good combination of newer songs and old favorites. Chris and the band also had great interaction with the crowd. 
The venue was comfortable, clean, easy to walk to, had good food and drink options, and the staff were friendly and helpful - I  would definitely consider traveling to another concert there."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,It was an amazing experience!  One I will treasure always!  I love Coldplay!  The music speaks to my soul!  The special affects made the experience surreal! Thank you Chris and your talented band!  You’re sharing your gifts and making the world a better place!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I bought tickets for my daughter's birthday.  She is one of H.E.R. biggest fans and she was opening for Coldplay. I told my daughter if she ever had a concert that I could drive to I would take her. Well, I surprised her with tickets. She almost jumped out of her skin when H.E.R walked out on stage. She knows everything about the singer. I wish  she could have met H.E.R. in person backstage or something.  Coldplay was AWESOME also. That was my first time hearing their songs and we loved every moment. It was very interactive and one of the highlights we enjoyed was the singing and the wrist bands. We had an awesome time."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The lights and effects, if possible, were as extraordinary as the music. So many great songs and EVERYBODY knows the lyrics. Chris Martin sang his heart out. Band members were all spectacular. Great charities were supported by everyone's ticket prices. The whole concert was a win-win."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,We loved the show. We knew that we were going to be far away but couldn’t buy seats closer to the stage. Very expensive. But the sound was very bad at the top of the stadium. Sometimes it was hard to even recognize the songs.
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was a great concert and venue. 
The stadium was so easy to navigate and everything was really well managed.
The COLDPLAY concert experience was all that I had hoped for. It’s really almost a stage show. The band is all so into everything, and then having the light up wristbands you get to be an interactive part of the show as well. 
This was my first concert at a big stadium like this. I wore ear plugs while the ceiling was closed, but once they opened the roof I took them out and it wasn’t overwhelming even though I’m a total introvert with sensory issues."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Magical evening with Coldplay! I’ve seen Coldplay now five times and this was by far the best show. They are so entertaining and the energy in the room is over the moon. Love everything about it. Will go see them again…
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Everything was so organized, stadium clean, stadium personal so attentive and nice, and the COLDPLAY concert was just magical!,awesome, a wonderful and unforgettable experience!!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Very entertaining, well put concert! Best concert I've ever been to and that includes a Pink Floyd concert. Will definitely go see them again when they are on tour."
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Quite literally the best concert I have ever Attended!  The band was energetic and put their all into the entire show.  Great interaction with the fans and the passion they give make the show!  Mercedes Benz Stadium was a great venue to attend!  Very clean and the most polite and accommodating staff!  I would repeat this night anytime!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay delivered an awesome show with exceptional lighting effects and crowd participation.   Fans were given wristbands upon entering the venue.  These lighted wristbands were synchronized to the music creating the coolest light show.   The opening singer H.E.R. was great and showed off her musical talents on various instruments, playing rap, blues, and soulful ballads.  Coldplay played their hearts out, moving among the stages, giving everyone a show to remember!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"After waiting for years for Coldplay to start a new tour I finally was able to fullfil a life goal :) amazing scenery, lightning. Many great old and new songs. Couldn’t ask for more and I wish I could relive that night!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Mercedes stadium is an awesome arena and the opened ceiling made Coldplay even more awesome! Coldplay has been on our bucket list for years and this was an awesome way to celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary!! They totally rocked the stage!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Me and my family went to this concert and it was hands down the best one we’ve ever been to. The energy was amazing, they interacted with the crowd. This was the kind of concert that even if you didn’t know the words, it would still be fun."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,The show was amazing I don't think anyone will top it
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I loved how they make you feel part of the show, they make you feel like you're literally a sky full of stars"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"As always, Coldplay was amazing, from the lightup wrist bands, to the fireworks, to a night of great music and pure fun!  Coldplay is simply awesome!"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I don’t really listen to cold play on my own, my father loves them so I know a few songs… I this was the second concert we’ve been to and there was no issues at all.. amazing light show, great energy all around"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"it was such an awesome experience, the energy in the stadium was amazing and I would go again if they ever come back to nj!"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Great concert as always.    This is probably the 20th time we have seen Coldplay in concert,  just when you think it can't get any better it does.   It was my first concert since COVID and I can't think of a better group to go see.   It's not just a concert it is a whole experience.    To top it off Bruce Springsteen made a special guest appearance and did 2 songs.    What a great night"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I’ve been to plenty of concerts before but not as quite as beautiful as seeing Coldplay. They put on a spectacular show. The best concert ever for me in a wonderful venue.
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"It was my dream get a ticket to watch Coldplay concert. More than 10 years trying to buy a single one in Brazil but I wasn't succeed. Now, watch them returning from the pandemic, at Metlife Stadium (Jew Jersey - USA), was so amazing that I can't explain. It will be on my mind forever. No words can explain this concert experience. I SIMPLY LOVE COLDPLAY."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I had the infinity ticket and we were seated at section 308. The price was perfect, affordable because we got the promo. The seat view was also perfect even if we were far almost the top we can see thru the screen, sung, jumped and dance to the music. Our section was so AWESOME 😎 It was like the cool kids sitting together. The transpo going to and from was smooth for us. I’ve been to Metlife Stadium before and this is my second time so I know a little bit where to go and what time should we left. Overall, the experience was a hella fantastic, goosebumps, lovely, wonderful, legendary experience for me and my friend."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Just saw Coldplay June 5, 2022 at Met Life Stadium. This is my 6th time seeing the band and they are better and better every single time. The show was flawlessly produced as always and is pure bliss and happiness."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Awesome show! They played many classics as well as many off the new album. The fireworks, lights, and led bracelets were out of this world. I would definitely recommend any fans to go."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The energy, sound, production, participation and surprises in this show were spectacular! Best show ever! I was so lucky to get to see it."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Excellent concert, a unique experience, many emotions together, I enjoyed it a lot, but the t-shirt I bought online did not arrive, I am still waiting for it"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"These guys know how to entertain! Besides the music, which is why we are all there, they have great interaction with the crowd, and visually it's like nothing I've ever seen! Lights on every wrist, working in time with the music. Fireworks! Multiple stages where they perform! It's just the kind of show you enjoy from beginning to end and want more when it's over. True artists."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The best show I have ever seen. The venue (Meadowlands) was well organized, everyone was friendly and helpful. The stadium was full and the crowd ready for a good time. The sound quality for the support act (H.E.R) was not that great, but she was good and full of energy, but everything for Coldplay was A+++. Sound quality was tremendous, the lighting and imagery was the best I have ever seen and Coldplay were out of this world. The crowd was jumping and dancing from the floor to the nose bleeds. It was one big Coldplay party, with Bruce Springsteen a surprise guest performance. It was a total WOW night, for the ages and will always be remembered. Chris Martin is a showman."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Well organized! Opening acts (H.E.R.) were amazing! 
Chris Martin and band mates put on an electrifying performance and an extra bonus “The Boss” Bruce Springsteen🥳🎶🥳🎶🥳"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Coldplay concert was absolutely an amazing and the best concert I’ve ever attended. The fireworks, the lights, the different colors, the music, everything was absolutely amazing and I wished I could go back in time to live the same happiness."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Trains,Planes & Automobiles...Travelled from FL-LI-NJ to celebrate Sam Y's 18th Birthday. For YEARS she dared to be different, most definitely got the judges attention & has figure skated to CLOCKS & SKY FULL OF STARS...WE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT! We Sang EVERY WORD, We Danced, We CAUGHT STARS, We lit up the stadium, We Cried, We SMILED, We Danced Some More. The surprise guest THE BOSS WOW, & We are like minded...The Mission to care people, for the earth & the environment...AMAZING. Sending LOVE to COLD PLAY & HOPE TO DO IT AGAIN!"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I love that vibe and All atmosphere there!Great songs and fantastic show even for peoples who are not listening Coldplay!
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,Truly amazing- Coldplay delivers the best concerts- 3rd time seeing them and the MetLife experience the absolute best! Staff at the stadium very helpful too (we had someone with a wheelchair) Chris Martin so endearing and connected with the audience- and the special appearance with Bruce Springsteen was unforgettable on the Sunday night! Will travel anywhere to see Coldplay…and well worth it!
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"From start to finish the show was awesome a totally engaging experience. Our whole came away from the show buzzing. The most visual concert we have ever seen. 
The ticketing experience was not good given we are from the UK. Ticket master uk does not cover USA which made booking really difficult. Plus this probably stopped the show from being a sell out. 
Pubic transport train from Manhattan was actually really well organised but not well published in New York. Our concierge advice was to get a Uber not a train which would have been 4 times more expensive and worse for the environment. 
These issues were forgotten after the show."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I had chills the whole concert. I always wanted to go watch Coldplay and finally i did hAve that opportunity. Everything was MAGIC! 100/10 everything
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I had such a great time at this concert. The last time I came to this venue was in 2016 to see Coldplay and we had seats. This time it was standing room only which was fine by me. 
I hope that they come back again soon."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Everything from this show was amazing. The visual effects, the band engagement with the public, the venue, the fireworks and visual effects with led wristbands not to mention their commitment to the environment. The concert was a threat to all senses. They are amazing live."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I knew Coldplay was always giving the best concerts, but this was something out of this world! The setlist was amazing, combining new songs and old classics, the atmosphere was so good with all the lights coming both from stage and bands, on top of fireworks, confetti and inflated balloons. Truly one of the best concerts i’ve ever been too."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Great show, felt like a 4th of July event with all the fire works and Coldplay did not disappoint, was an amazing epic show full of great energy!!!"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"It was the best experience in my whole life in concert, the band, effects, the lights, everything was perfect! UNFORGETTABLE 😍❤️🙌🏻"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Loved every minute & every note of this show!! We came from Ontario, Canada as there are currently no Canadian dates for their tour. 
It was my 3rd time seeing Coldplay & they never disappoint. It was our 1st trip to NYC & NJ…..Would go back in a heartbeat 💗 
Thank you gentlemen,  for all you do for your fans 💕"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I was there with my kids, 11 & 7, their first concert (!!) and it was amazing!! We all had a great time, danced and jumped and loved every moment. The sound was great, the band was amazing and lots of surprises!! :)"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I’ve been attending Coldplay concerts for over a decade now, and I don’t plan on stopping for as long as they tour. There is not a bad seat in the house for their concerts. Coldplay goes out of their way with light up wristbands to make sure every fan in the venue feels like a part of the show. Already looking forward to the next time Coldplay tours the U.S."
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Loved it, loved it, loved it! They are electric and make the crowd feel so warm and welcome to the show. The pyrotechnics, confetti guns and balloons made the show just so good!"
6/14/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,The entrance at the stadium was a little un organized. They will sent you to different lines. Employees didn’t know well how to direct the crowds. Because of that I got there on the first train but I couldn’t get in for a while and I didn’t get the spot I wanted in arena.
6/13/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay totally outdone themselves! This was the best concert experience I've had as far as artist goes. Venue...needs improvement on getting where you need to go. I wasn't happy about most of the before..but Coldplay...speechless!
6/13/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I have been to a lot of concerts this was the best by far! I will never forget it. All types of ppl and races all came together and had a great night!
6/13/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I would see Coldplay yearly if that was their tour schedule. They put on the best show I have ever seen. I love how sincere they seem and they are always so gracious to their fans.
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The way that Chris Martin connected with such a huge audience was astonishing! The overall show was incredible, S.H.E was fantastic and Coldplay blew all of my expectations out of the water! Experience of a lifetime!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This was hands down THE BEST concert I've ever been to! The venue, the setup, the security, the merch tables... all were efficient and got everyone through in a timely manner. Coldplay ROCKED of course!! But I have to also say how incredibly impressed I was with their green energy setup! They are setting a new, eco-friendly standard for concert touring and concert attending! With recycled oil to power generators, plant based 'plastic', storing kinetic energy from fans, using ticket profits to support eco-charities, just to name a few! Well done Coldplay!!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This was my 9th time seeing Coldplay perform and as always, they put on a spectacular performance and show!! If you ever get the chance to see them, do it!! You’ll have an amazing time!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,The performance was highly energetic and they visual ecstasy. It’s fun to go to a concert where the spectators are part of the show.
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Amazing concert! Traveled many, MANY miles to see Coldplay and would do it again and again. Lumen Field was also a great venue to experience them. 15/10 recommend ♥️"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay was amazing, as usual. A visual spectacle, super high-energy, and of course the best mix of classics, favorites, and new hits. It’s impossible not to feel good after a show like this!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Out of all the concerts I’ve been to, Coldplay will always be one of the best live shows I’ve experienced. Amazing performance!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay always puts on a great show! I always felt like they gave A LOT back to the fans, compare to most arties, they always pull out all the stop and give us a great show, and Chris seem to be such a great person and genuinely care bout their fans, if you want just ONE unforgettable experience in your life time, than go to a Coldplay concert, you don't even need to ever heard any of their music, just go!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Possibly one of the best shows I have attended!!!!!!!!!! and many thanks to Ticketmaster to providing a easy and convenient way to allow me to see them live.
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Our experience at this last concert was absolutely incredible. It was my 12 and 14 y/o’s first Coldplay concert and they LOVED it! The whole show is so full of energy! The light up bracelets really bring everyone together, and no matter where you are sitting, you are part of it all. 

We will definitely go again whenever they come to our hometown! Thank you to the whole band for touring all these years. I hope you keep it going, we LOVE YOU!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Chris Martin did not disappoint! Not only was the light show, fireworks, and props exceptional, but my favorite part was his challenge to turn off phones and just be and experience the moment together! It will be unforgetable!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"I have been to hundreds of concerts and this one was by far the best I've ever seen. It was fun and energetic. I laughed, I cried and I danced. Absolutely incredible experience"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Best Performance ever!!! Chris Martin put on the best show of his life. The energy was electric and Amazing! Great Concert!!!
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,A Coldplay concert is something that everyone should experience at least once in their lives. Even if you don’t know many or any songs at all. It was a wonderful experience
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Our seats were high up. And so I expect to not see much. But we couldn’t see the screens either. 
Not much of a show for us. I could have stayed home and listened to their album."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Confetti, oversized balloons to replicate planets, LED wrist bands (from recycled plastic), crowd singalong, unstoppable Chris energy, humble entertainers, topped of my an amazing fireworks finale (thank you open air Lumen Field) could not have been any better. Class all the way!!!!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,The lights were amazing and I loved when Coldplay invited those people on the stage. Loved all the jokes and how chill it was. Would definitely go again but next time on the floor for more dancing and jumping!
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"From my gym workout in Rockhampton, Australia in 2,000 where they kept their first hit Yellow on a loop, I hated that signature guitar strum… Any song overplayed on a loop will drive one nuts with saturation. But the group followed up with Cold Rush of Blood to the Head, that’s when I learned what Coldplay was, a group with their frontman Chris Martin capable of finding the anthemic pulse their audience responds to… fast forward a full generation from Clocks to several albums later, seemingly at The Speed of Sound and you get a repertoire that created The Spheres Tour with a Wristband light show lighting up the entire Lumen Field (genius). And shrinking Lumen Field into an intimate experience with three stages where Chris Martin could jog and skip from stage to stage making every seat in this large football venue into a personal inclusive experience. 

The best produced concert I have ever witnessed and I grew up in the 60’s and 70’s, two of the signature decades for live music in the US of A."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I really enjoyed this concert but wish it was a little longer. Also there are some songs you shouldn’t mess with but Fix You was off key and cut short.
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Loved the eco-conscious power supply with the kinetic dance floors and bikes! The show was truly remarkable to watch and be apart of! Every song is a smash hit and the celestial/planetary vibes were a real treat!
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Best concert of my life, Coldplay never misses! Lumen field is an incredible venue and the concert will live in my memory forever!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay is honestly hands down the best concert of my life. I do wish the event staff handled the entry for GA better because those of us that waited 5 hours in line ended up going in at the same time as those that got there when the gates opened. The show itself was amazing though!
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,This was easily the best concert I’ve ever been to. The production was amazing and everything was so well put together. I loved all the fireworks and being about to experience this with my best friend was amazing.
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Voldplay shows are just AMAZING. It's impossible not to have a good time once the show starts. It truly is incredible what a sbow they pull off
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"To see Coldplay in concert is such a thrilling experience.  They sound amazing, and it's so visually stunning.  Hope we get the chance to see them again."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,One of the best shows I've ever seen. And I've have been to over 450 concerts. Coldplay was incredible with great appreciate for everyone involved. Would recommend them to anyone & everyone who wants to see one of the best concert in the world!!!
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"(Again Coldplay is incredible live so this review is for Lumen and for infinity tickets)

I got infinity tickets which I will never do again. Yes I realize they were cheap but also if they would have said we’d be behind the stage and obstructed, there is no way I’d have bought them. It made a horrible experience. 
Also the top level is so echo-y at lumen field that these should not be sold for concerts. I was so disappointed and have lost a ton of trust."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,One of my top 5 concerts. Absolutely amazing show from start to finish. This was my first time seeing them live and I was not disappointed.  Flew from Atlanta to Seattle just to see them. Worth every dollar spent! Would see them again!
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay was my first concert. I've been chasing the euphoria I felt since and the only thing that has been able to beat it has been Coldplay themselves. I was able to get Infinity tickets and experience an Adventure of a Lifetime.
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Loved Coldplay, loved the concert - would have loved the floor to not be GA but seating that could be purchased."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This concert was no just a concert it was an experience! The vibe all night was so positive and full of love.  I so blessed to be part of it, because words can’t describe the show."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,This was a first concert my wife has ever attended and it is her favorite group. We were on the floor near the stage and the energy of the band and crowd really made it a memorable experience for both of us.
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"One of the best concerts I've ever been to. The venue staff were all super sweet and helpful, the show was great, my seat was easy to find and everything sounded amazing. I hope coldplay come back to seattle"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Out of all the western acts/concerts I've been to, no one can top the energy and awesomeness of their concert! They're next to my BTS group."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Don’t get me wrong, Coldplay was amazing, and always has been. But I’ve been to many concerts at Lumen Field with no issue. This one was def off. It started with the first performer, when you could not hear any word they were saying because their mic was too high. When Coldplay showed up it was a little better but not great. And I’ve seen them multiple times where their sound was perfect! They were either too loud or too quiet. 
But like I said, it had nothing to do with them. They were still great, and I would still do it again. I had fun with my friends, and that was the important part. 
It’s always fun when they interact with the crowd. Everyone always enjoys that."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay…need I say more. Their music, their charisma..just everything.  I love that they carry Wooteo around with them as a reminder of Jin and BTS as their musical siblings."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It was the best concert i have ever been to! And it will probably be difficult to top this off. I just wished Lumen Field had more Marshalls or staff to point people to their seats. A lot of people got confused looking for the correct seats. Some seats are labelled, in example, Block 307 Row II or Row HH, which is super confusing especially to those who have not been to the stadium before. Otherwise, THE.BEST.CONCERT.EVER!!"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Never been to a concert like this. It was an amazing experience. Out of this world fro, Coldplay. It was worth every penny!"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I’m not sure if there are words to describe how wonderful the show was. Had the time of my life and got to see the concert of my dreams. Thank you for the music you share and play for us…
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The absolute most fantastic concert experience I’ve ever had! Like an out of body experience, the production, great mix of old and new songs, light show with the wrist bands was awesome. Everything about it was outstanding. I wish I could attend every single show on this tour, it was that great! Coldplay is the best band in the world!"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay was incredible!!! Such a fun concert!! Didn’t like the Mercedes Benz Arena -way to small for that many people
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Best concert i have ever gone. I felt like i am attending a giant party, interactive and engaging. The ambiance is out of this world, sound is great. And to top it all, there was a surprise guest showed up on the stage and it was Kelly Rowland from Destiny’s child. Whaaat..??? Ok. Mic dropped !"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We've seen them a few times, but this year's show was the best ever. The sound quality at MB was better than usual. I can only assume it is because the roof was open. I have said many times that there is no current band that is truly ""Rock and Roll"" besides these guys and this show proved that even more. Their vocals and showmanship are unmatched. Another great thing is how much fun they seem to have. I don't know if they are really having that much fun but I hope they are. Thanks for a great show."
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,The light show was astonishing and I was absolutely amazed during the whole thing. Even non-Coldplay fans would’ve enjoyed the show!
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Like literally outside of my body is what I felt like watching this show. Coldplay has always been a favorite band and I knew we had to see them at some point. Incredibly lucky to have caught them at this exact moment in time. The entertainment value was off the charts. I will be speaking the gospel of Coldplay to whoever will listen for years to come.
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"it was a fun and engaging event with coldplay! 
but two things really upset me and left a terrible impression of the event. one was the adherence to such strict rules for the purses: mine was within the measurements, but because the small piping around the purse went over the measurements we had to pay $10 for it to be kept in a locker, all because a security check would've been too difficult to do? and it wasn't just me, but one of my companions as well, even though when we bought our purses we went with a piece of paper with the measurements so we could get something within the guidelines. 
the second thing that upset me was the fact that everyone around us was maskless. now, i know what the cdc guidelines say, but i think it shouldn't be left to personal responsibility whether to be masked or not during what's essentially a superspreader event. i felt absolutely unsafe, even though i was double-masked and have three doses of the covid vaccine. with all these personal precautions, i still came home and tested positive for covid, which will make me miss out on a week of work and therefore lose income. i am Not laying all the blame on the event, as i could've caught it elsewhere, but considering the factors mentioned above and the fact that we were at a place with a capacity of over 70k people, it's not difficult for me to connect the dots. i'd ask for due diligence to protect the people you purport to make money from, but we all know this message will reach absolutely no one."
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,All I could ask for and more in a band. So professional in sound and performance making you feel welcome to their music.
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay was hands down the best concert I have ever attended!  I am a senior and have attended many, many concerts in my 63 years, but this one blew me away!  Chris Martin and  the band members are all unbelievably talented but even beyond their talent, their humbleness is a breath of fresh air in the our narcissistic society.  I am blessed to have been a spectator of one of the best bands of all times!  Thank you Coldplay, Atlanta and Mercedes Benz Stadium!!!"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Everything about this venue, the food, the seats, merchandise was planned very well and organized! I am  disabled and in a wheelchair,but it was easy to move around and the security personnel were very accommodating and professional! The concession line was great and the food and drinks were very reasonable in price and tasted very good and was hot and having unlimited refills on soft drinks was amazing! The show was great and the artists phenomenal! Coldplay really lived up to their reputation as Global Citizens by having everything used in the show being sustainable and recycling lots of the technology used in the show, utilizing the open roof to keep the venue cool and the bicycles to charge the tech and equipment used in the show. Well Done and thanks to the Mercedes-Benz stadium staff too!"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This concert was everything I wanted it to be plus so much more.  The mix of old and new songs was perfect. The crowd was very engaged.  They have not played in Atlanta in 21 years and they sound just as amazing today. This is not a show to miss!!!
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Such a fantastic event. Cold play concert is the best combination of talent , technology and massive collective participation !"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Love the lights love that Chris Martin wanted The fans on Americans to get involved with his songs and saying it was just a beautiful amazing experience I am so happy that I went with the man that I love we both love Coldplay and Chris Martin he is an amazing artist
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I am so glad that I bought these tickets. It was an amazing show and I would tell anyone that is a Coldplay fan to BUY the tickets! You won’t regret it!
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay is awesome! They’re awesome I. The studio and even better live. This is my second time seeing them and their audio/video for the show is the best. The Mercedes Benz stadium was trash. There was so much echo during the opener that they decided to open the roof. Also, Chris Martin stuttered during a song so I know the echo got to him. This place is terrible for concerts. I wouldn’t recommend seeing a show here."
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The concert experience was very engaging.  The wristbands they give you  are interactive throughout the show and is unlike any other experience you will ever have at a concert.  If you have a chance to go, do not hesitate!!"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay has been my favorite band ever since I was a child and I had always dreamt of attending one of their concerts. Finally got to see them in ATL this time and every aspect of the concert was magical! I would definitely want to attend another one of their concerts.
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The Coldplay concert was amazing from start to finish. HER did a wonderful job transitioning from her soulful songs to songs with a little more “rock” flavor. I’m sure she gained a few more fans. Coldplay intertwined their musical genius with fantastic showmanship and creative use of lights. I sang, danced, and ohed and awed the entire night. Having Kelly Rowland join for a song was also a nice touch."
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I didn’t think I would ever get the chance to see Coldplay live. Tickets are usually expensive and hard to get not to mention traveling costs as well. My fiancé and I were able to get our tickets for $80 each in the “nosebleed” section which in my opinion ended up being one of the best seats in the house. You could see the entire layout of the stadium and in turn got the full experience of Coldplays fantastic light display. They really put on a performance that could be enjoyed regardless of where you were seated. I got to hear songs played live I’ve always wanted to hear. It was fantastic
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I’ve been to hundreds of shows and festivals from the stones, to jack white, to LCD sound system, and Coldplay easily is top 3 for me all time! Incredible. Chris Martin is one of a kind!"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,We were incredibly impressed with Coldplay and their energy for the entire show.  My wife’s a huge Coldplay fan and this show was a dream for her.  I am a casual listener and I was thoroughly impressed with how entertaining they were.  Mercedes Stadium is a great place to see a show as well.
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We only paid $20 for infinity tickets so we really can’t complain too much. I thought I would be happy to be anywhere in the stadium but our seats were so high up, to the side of the stage and behind the speakers. The sound was horrible. You could barely tell what songs they were playing. We did enjoy the light show from up there though. Fortunately it wasn’t our first Coldplay show and the last one we saw was amazing!! Learned my lesson on buying infinity tickets and driving eight hours to get to a show we couldn’t even hear!!"
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Best performance ever, hands down! I don’t think you can ever top the experience. Sound, music, lights, and overall genuine presence of a band that is truly having fun and living their dream. It showed. Great venue with fluid traffic flow and amazing organization for that number of people."
10/4/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay was amazing, the show was spectacular! H.E.R and Mariah did great too! So much energy, the way they connected with the audience was great! An event that is unforgettable! I hope to see them again one day! The stadium was great too! I loved it!"
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Loved this show so much. We were on the floor and danced all night. The band was amazing. It was such a cool experience to be part of the light show. We will remember it always. If your haven’t seen Coldplay live - you need to put this on your Bucket list.
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I have seen probably over 100 concerts in my life and I do not think I ever saw this many cool effects. Light up LED wristbands were given to everyone who came and sitting up high I was able to see the color of the crowd literally light up to fit each song (for example during Yellow they all lit up yellow) lasers, fireworks, costumes, they really went above and beyond putting on a legendary show and of course the actual music was awesome too!"
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"First time to see Coldplay. AMAZING!!! Chris Martin is all energy. The sound, the lighting, especially the wristbands, the fireworks were off the charts. The rain did not stop us from having a fantastic time. The crowd was friendly and not too rowdy. I'd go see them again in a heartbeat."
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Couldn’t have asked for a better family experience for our two kids 7, 12. Both their first concert and can’t wait to get to the next show!!"
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay’s concert at the Linc was outstanding. The playlist, the stage, the fireworks. Everything was just incredible. Thank you Coldplay for such an amazing and unforgettable night!"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,This is the second time I have seen them live. Ever since I saw them first perform I have compared every concert to Coldplay. They put on an amazing show that honestly can’t be matched by anyone else. They are true artists and performers. I will see them any chance I get for as long as they tour.
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Great concert in all ways! Excellent music, great crowd, amazing audience participation and easy in & out access, all in a beautiful fresh air stadium."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Elegance in sprezzatura! Coldplay has achieved all the seasoned polish and command of Industry statesmen; delivering masterful art with intellect, vision and intuition. The ability to bring 58,000 strangers into unity and cohesion speaks to the heart of their purpose. From row one to rafters we felt our belonging. Kinetics. Bracelets. Music. Life!!
Absolutely exhilarating and meaningful.❤️"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The production was incredible, the experience was once in a lifetime, the band did not disappoint in the slightest… it was everything you could ask for in a concert."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"I’ve never in a concert like this, it was amazing from beginning to end! Thanks for coming to Seattle. Love you Coldplay always!"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay was hands down the best concert experience that I’ve ever had. The band was charismatic and energetic with (obviously) outstanding vocals. The light up bracelets were a magical touch to the show and the crowd was up on their feet and dancing even way up in the nosebleeds. I highly recommend that everyone go to see Coldplay live at least once in their lives.
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,It was a blast of concert. And also H.E.R she was totally amazing singer. That was actually for my daughter’s gift birthday wish to see her favorite band. Chris Martin was totally excellent performer.
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The best concert I’ve ever been to. Incredible band. (Coldplay) the light up bracelets, the fireworks, Chris Martin is an incredible entertainer! Core memory for sure!"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Coldplay was absolutely amazing. There's nothing like being at one of their concerts. It's like attending a huge music festival all in one night. Once in a lifetime type experience - absolutely AMAZING 😍✨💫
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Absolutely THE BEST CONCERT EVER!! My 10 year old daughter and I danced for 2 hours, shared laughter and tears and are still daydreaming about this EPIC night🥳 “Daughter said: We are not Swifties, mom, We are Coldies😂😂”🙌 Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the most incredible night!!! We are fans for life for sure! Have seen Coldplay in many cities across US and it has always been a life changing experience. Now my daughter is growing up loving them as much! What they do for humanity, our planet and the way they inspire new generation is absolutely incredible and I just feel so blessed to live in the same lifetime as them❤️ God bless you guys and may you continue shining forever and bringing light and love to the WORLD✨❤️✨"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It was one of the best concerts ever, I want them to have another trip in America, I 1000000% recommended going to their concert it was soooo good!! I love it!"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay is that group everyone should see. Your ticket is admission to the show. It also comes with a  love button, a recyclable light wrist band and encouraged audience participation.  It’s the band that finishes out the night and you can smile and be ok with it being over. It’s the band you take home on the bus humming all the way. It’s the band that you fall asleep to in your head and wake up still humming.   Never miss Coldplay when they are in your town."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The performance was amazing! The lighting, the sound quality, the visuals, the personality of the band, and obviously, the music! I loved how many jokes were made during the performance, too!"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I had so much fun. The staff were friendly and managed the crowd quite well even though everybody was excited. The audio sounded good after the arena filled up and the lights were cool!!
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It started with the really friendly and welcoming staff at the gates and just got better from there. Lumen Field is clean and bright and easy to navigate. We missed a couple of the early acts, but H.E.R. was good. And then there was Coldplay. Perfect in every way."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Both H.E.R. and Coldplay exceeded expectations. Coldplay’s live show in a venue that size is absolutely experiential and magical.  The kind of experience you don’t want to end.  Worth every penny!
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"My third time seeing Coldplay and won't be my last. Felt like an intimate time with 58000 of my closest friends. 
The only fly in the ointment was all the unannounced street closures making it very difficult to find parking...$80.00 parking."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,The Coldplay concert was the best concert that I’ve been to in awhile. The crowd was so energized and everyone was singing. Lumen Field is a great venue. The lights on our wrists just made the evening more special.
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Rarely do I leave reviews here, if ever, but this show was outright euphoric.  Easily a group of performers that I would see again!"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"I was preparing to catch a plane the day of the concert with my granddaughter and the flight was cancelled, talk about a let down for both of us. I come home and ordered tickets for the Sandiego show. We are so excited and hope nothing gets in the way this time ."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Great concert.  Amazing production: lights, stage, fireworks, planets, light-up wrist bands, etc.....  Chris Martin was in great form. He's an amazing front-man.  Highly recommend you seeing them on this tour!"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Best concert I’ve ever been to and I am a concert junkie. It was what I would imagine seeing the beetles or Elvis would have been like back in the day. It has always been a bucket list for me and truly moved me to tears! So much emotion and energy. The flashing bands were a blast too!!!!
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Cold Play was the most energized and fun concert I’ve been to in ages! The light up bracelets are such a fun addition to their concert!

Definitely don’t go if you have seizures that are triggered by flashing lights….

The first two opening acts were not enjoyable. The lady who came on right before Cold Play was super talented and I enjoyed her.

Wish Cold Play had stayed on longer. We flew across the country to go see them. Would definitely go see them again!"
7/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Literally the best night of my life. Don’t think another concert could top that, unless I go see them again but it was amazing!!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Most energetic and visually pleasing show I have ever seen. The band genuinely looks like they love what they are doing. This was my first Coldplay show. I will tell all my friends that they are a must see. I feel like it doesn’t even matter if you know the songs.
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Perfect night..even when it thundered during their performance during Sparks...cooincidence but something else!  FLY EAGLES FLY 😄
6/11/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Coldplay concert was an unforgettable experience that left me with a mix of emotions. But first, let's talk about the warm-up act.

🌟 **H.E.R.'s Warm-Up:**I couldn't help but wonder if she was the best choice for this particular audience. Like many others, I had never heard of her before this concert. Her frequent deviations from the music to address the audience, while well-intentioned, felt a bit disconnected from the flow of the show.

🚀 **Coldplay's Brilliance:** Now, on to the main event—Coldplay. Their performance was nothing short of outstanding. The band's commitment to making the world a better place through their donations and environmental efforts is truly inspiring. Their music, combined with their message, created a unique and powerful atmosphere.

💫 **LED Bracelets:** The LED bracelets provided to the audience were a stroke of genius. They made me feel like an integral part of the show, connecting with thousands of others in a breathtaking display of unity. I can honestly say I've never felt happier during a concert. It was an experience that radiated positivity and togetherness.

🙏 **A Note of Respect:** However, there was a bittersweet note to the night. Some concertgoers decided to take these beautiful bracelets home as souvenirs. I would like to appeal to everyone attending future Coldplay concerts: please don't do that. These bracelets are part of the show's magic, and by taking them, we're not only disrespecting the band but also the hardworking team behind the scenes. Let's cherish the positive energy they bring and leave with memories, not mementos."
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was truly amazing. Great music, fireworks and lights. The only thing negative  was that it was a little too loud. It almost sounded like it was blowing the speakers at times. I honestly think it would have sounded even better if it were down a few decibels. I’m surprised Chris Martin wouldn't be more sensitive to the volume."
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"This was my second time to see Coldplay, and once again, it was a thrill! From the moment the guys came on stage, the music was awesome, as were the lights and fireworks. I have been a Coldplay fan for many years, and seeing them live has created some of my very best memories. It's amazing how good music can make you feel. I also love the fact that Coldplay does so many positive things with their fame and money, which is not something you see that often from celebrities. There were images and information projected prior to the concert to show some of their worldwide projects. As far as the musical selection, there was a great mix from all of the albums, from Parachutes to Music of the Spheres. My daughter's boyfriend, who is actually a country fan, was impressed and even commented that ""Chris Martin has the voice of an angel."" (Well, I already knew that, but still...) It was a really fun night, and I can't wait to see my British Boys again!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay never lets you down!! Whether you are on the floor or in the nose bleeders, they seem to manage reaching everyone with a great live show!! The light up wrist bands are one of my fave parts!!!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay was amazing. They can throw a show and have you smiling all night. Fireworks, interactive bracelets and a good time!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was great, but traffic getting to the venue was a DISASTER. There were no traffic police and  I guess the parking attendants decided to start letting everyone in at the last minute because whatever they were doing wasn’t helping the flow of traffic. Basically, I stayed 5 minutes from the venue and it took me 45 minutes to get to fedex field because of stand still traffic. So I missed 45 minutes of the show. The LED bracelets were great but I wish they would’ve worked for every song."
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"I cannot tell you how much I have taken this group into my heart.  My husband has been a fan from the start but ever since seeing them in Melbourne in 2017 (birthday present for hubby) I have been a little in love with them.  Their music and ‘stage show’ (wristbands) are fabulous, they seem like such lovely human beings and thank their fans after every gig.  Who could ask for more?"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"great opening acts.  gave us enough break in between to the real show start.  When Coldplay came out, the fireworks were unexpected.  The energy of the concert from the band to the audience was so lively. I was entertained the whole time.  Vibe of the concert was high the whole time! We had a couple of encore songs! It was fantastic! I can't wait to go again!!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"This was the best concert I’ve had!!! All the experience was great (with the exception of the parking logistic). But everything was awesoooome!! The sound, the show, food, seats, EVERYTHIIIIING!!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"I wasn’t even that into Coldplay, just going with a friend, but I was quickly won over. They waited to start because so many people were held back by the horrible traffic, so I didn’t miss the show! The event made an effort to have environmental initiatives that I’ve never seen before, including having people on bikes and kinetic floors powering it. I loved the performance aspect of engaging the crowd as well as the music- even though I only knew their old stuff, their new songs were great too. So much fun!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,Amazing. Judt like last time. Took my son this time (he's 9) and he had a blast too. Will come see them again next time they come!
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"Had a blast at the concert; got to the venue EARLY so we had NO problems with the parking!  LOVED the opening acts and Coldplay put on a wonderful show.  The amount of energy is electrifying!  They could've skipped using the puppet but it was not a deal breaker.  Sad that one day soon this band will stop touring.  They really care about the environment; was happy to see everything GREEN-themed. LOVED the wrist bands, fireworks, balloons and confetti.  Keep up the great work!  Thanks for the special  DC song from the good 'ole WHFS festival days!  Do not miss this band when they return!  We'll be there!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I’ve been to hundreds of music festivals and shows in my life, and Coldplay Philly 2022 was literally the Best Concert Experience I’ve ever witnessed! 55,000 fans all singing and dancing to every song?? 55,000 fans all connected together through LED Wristbands?? Please Come Back Soon! 🤯👏✨"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This was by far the best concert I’ve been too… this was an experience of a lifetime and a great bday gift for my ❤️
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I have been to a lot of concerts but this was on a whole new level.  Great music, tons of positive energy, visual effects were out of this world.
Please come back soon Coldplay!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Maybe the best show we’ve ever seen for lighting, fireworks, lasers etc.  Musically, the band didn’t fail to deliver an exceptional performance.  Overall, one of the top 10 best shows we’ve ever seen and we’ve seen an incredible number of shows."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay felt a little BiG concert “me too” like…what does that mean, well it just felt kinda boring tbh, and that they were going through the motions. Crowd lighting was impressive and if Chris didn’t smile and act like he was having fun I’m not sure they are worth seeing live tbh as the remainder of the band don’t really entertain. Sound was ok for a big arena. 
What am I comparing CP too, well I took my daughter to Shaun Mendes in Sydney along with 30,000 other young girls and I can tell you that that young man certainly knows how to entertain with great energy and charisma."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay puts on such an incredible show - there are no words. I’ve been reliving it all week. The lights, flashing wristbands, song choices, fireworks… it was an absolutely incredible night. I’ll be waiting for their next tour with baited breath."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Unequivocally best concert I've ever been to. And that includes U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, etc. Coldplay shared gratitude for what it took for audience to be there, included the audience on a personal level in the show, and the tech and performance level was insane. We drove to Philly from Chapel Hill, NC and it was worth every hour of driving, every dollar of hotel, parking and expenses. Would go again tomorrow if they were there! Spectacular."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The concert was great !! The stadium staff sucked ! It was soo unorganized… I paid $350 for 2 floor seats & other people paid $30-50 for floor seats, so not fair !! They let just anyone on the floor so we were pushed all the way to the back & we paid the most for our tix.. I didn’t like that there weren’t any actual seats on the floor like last time …"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This show was fantastic. The production value was on point and created an amazing atmosphere. And Coldplay absolutely delivered. Not even the rain could spoil it!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I’ve been to a lot of excellent big concerts by a lot of artists over the years. Coldplay set a new standard. 

Their ability to engage an audience of 55,000 people in an immersive concert experience is beyond anything I’ve ever seen."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Horrible parking situation at Lincoln Financial Field, completely disorganized. Entrance to stadium was completely disorganized, waited in line for over an hour, just to be told to go to a different entrance for floor access- turns out multiple entrances had floor access, and i blame ticketmaster & eagles organization for not communicating that better & clearer. As for the show, very unimpressed with song selection, seemed very ""rush through setlist to get out quick"", given the hype of last coldplay tour (yeah, ok🤥🤔🤑). All of that with the fact that the floor seemed over-sold, way too many people on floor- no room anywhere with people just knocking/bumping/running into you while trying to enjoy show. This leads me to final point... sound & system mix was terrible from floor & upper side areas.. had friends in those sections who relayed they had hard time making out what was being said or sung. Wrist band show was cool again."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"It was Coldplay's best concert ever. 1st time I seen them in Philadelphia and I came from Florida. The best and emotional time was when they were singing Fix You and it starting raining, I cried and seen other fans cried. Such a beautiful song with beautiful words. Thank you Coldplay til next time."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay puts on a truly amazing show. I feel so lucky that I finally saw them in concert after being a huge fan for so long. It was equally as emotional as it was fun and I had the time of my life. Checked off my bucket list!!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This concert has shot it’s way to the very top of my list. Chris reaches out grabs you and transports you to another place in time. Then backs it up with a light show that is not only made possible by the audience participation it’s an-out of body experience. Brilliant Coldplay. You rock like no other. Don’t stay away so long next time. Your music can save the world. Thank you for understanding our need for music 🎶. You deliver for sure. ☮️❤️🎶🎵
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The music, the fireworks, the lighted wristbands made this show one of the best concerts I’ve been too.  It was so great they did the Eagles fight song.  They went out of their way to make it a show for Philadelphia."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Saw Coldplay at the Link. Clear instructions on how to download the tickets, bag restrictions for the venue and parking. Coldplay was awesome! I would absolutely go see them again. Great concert"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This was my second time seeing Coldplay live. Both experiences blew me away. This band puts on one the the best shows in the world. You feel so connected with them, and the people around you, it's indescribable until you experience it yourself and it is just so so special. I will tell anyone that will listen to me that you have to see them live at least once in your life. It's a beautiful emotional rollercoaster, and not to mention fun as all hell!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,1st time seeing Coldplay and it won’t be my last. Really enjoyed the show and music. Definitely recommend seeing them. They seem like good guys too and were gracious enough to do an encore for Philly in the rain.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"From the beginning to end. What a life changing experience, super clean environment and organized so well. From the lights and fireworks with every detail well thought out. Thank you for such a beautiful concert. I could see them over and over if I could."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,The Coldplay concert in Philadelphia was the best concert I have ever been to. Looking around you could see that everyone was having the best time. The band was awesome and played their best songs.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Imagine having a personalized concert with one of the biggest Band in the world! They paused and restart the song just to make the experience even more unimaginable!

The Visual, the music, the crowd! Everything’s perfect!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay was amazing (rain and all)! I saw them in Philadelphia and had the best time. It was such a positive experience after a hard school year!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Everything was super amazing! The show, the songs, the band, the lights, the atmosphere. The only thing that was not cool is us having to go back to our car to put our vaporizer in but when we were sitting in the stadium people had vapes…"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This was the 2nd time I have seen COLDPLAY and can't wait for them to come back to Philly!! Their energy is infectious and their kindness shines, throughout their performance.
Love those guys!!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,The concert was high energy from the start to the finish.  Pyrotechnics throughout.  Lots of great old songs and enough of the new ones to satisfy everyone.  Chris Martin really seemed humble and wants to connect with the crowd.  The Eagles victory song was a great addition.  One of the top 5 concerts I've ever been to.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The show was pretty good but the sound got messed up multiple times and ruined the songs.  His mic cut out, instruments cut out…maybe it was the rain?"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Seats in section 102 were ideal, sound was a little choppy, but Coldplay continues to be one of the best live shows ever.  They put on a wonderful show and were engaging all the way through.  Downside on the venue, long bathroom lines, no soap or paper towels, and that was before the concert!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Part rock concert/part rave - all inclusive arena sized fun ! I’m a huge Coldplay fan & thought they were one of the few tours that would bring me back to a stadium for a show since the pandemic started - and they did not disappoint! Their opening three songs already topped their last tour. And the “Fly Eagles Fly” sing a long during the encore was a nice gift to the Philly fans fighting off Mother Nature’s mini monsoon at that point. Coldplay is one of the most entertaining live bands with a deep catalog of hits that never miss their mark.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Everything was just spot on. Chris Martin sounded perfect and the music was great. The experience with the light up wrist bands, pyrotechnics, confetti and beachballs made it a night i won’t forget."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay were superb. Love their commitment to sustainability.  Laser lights, LED bracelets and a tremendous sound system that bordered on the too loud but didn’t actually hit it. A packed stadium enjoyed some Philly-personal comments by Chris Martin. Both warm up singers were great too especially H.E.R but to be honest the clarity of the sound for the warm up acts left a bit to be desired. If you didn’t know the songs, you had no chance of hearing the lyrics, for the most part. But tremendous music!  Great night out and worth every cent"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Parking was issue for people who arrived on time. I would suggest an hour early and tailgate.  The arrival traffic jam could have been handled better.  Otherwise great energy and great crowd and wonderful event.  Thanks to Cold play!  Wonderful night. Thanks for everything!  Wednesday night and rain all worth the band!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,The best concert I’ve been too! It was such an in the moment experience! The lights and visuals were amazing. General admission was the place to be ! 10/10
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Wish I knew Coldplay wouldnt be on till 9pm. The opening act was a true waste of time. But Coldplay, the energy, the light up wristbands, the kindness you can see in their hearts, and the passion in their music is unbelievable. Such an amazing time."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Loved this concert..left early due to rain, but we truely lived what we saw. The led lights on the wrist were awesome."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This was my first Coldplay concert and it was an amazing night! My seats had a good view of the stage with no obstructed view!! Would definitely purchase tickets again!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Concert was great!
Parking experience was awful. Took as long to get in the Wells Fargo lot as it did to get to the stadium area - coming from Lansdale. They had 2 or 3 gates open for entry, while for Flyers, Sixers and Wells Fargo events 4 or 5 gates are open. 
Leaving was worse.  It took 90 minutes to get out of the parking lot... the concert was 120 minutes.  2 gates open for exit,  a complete and total disaster. Concert ended at 11:00, reached our car by 11:20 and exited the lot at 12:50. Unacceptable... and good look finding out who's responsible for parking management"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Great experience, good organization, the process of entrance was fast and easy, and the concert one of the best in my life !!!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay did not disappoint, they put on an amazing show that kept the crowd pumped and engaged.  The wristbands made the whole experience something special."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay was great! The venue was horrible and inefficiently managed. Traffic and parking was chaotic. Entrance and security was mismanaged and inefficient. No toilet paper in women’s bathroom (beginning of evening). Lines for beverages only to find out they are out of stock for the kind wanted.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"As usual Coldplay delivered a top notch concert. Skipped a few great songs but when you have so many great songs, you have to draw the line somewhere."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The genuinely look like they are having a great time.  We danced the whole show.  The wrist band lights were so cool as well as fire works.  Just wish it lasted longer but rain probably made them shorten up.  
Chris Martin is amazing."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Unbelievable show. I will never miss a Coldplay concert. The light show makes you feel a part of a larger whole…because guess what…as human beings we are.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,It was simply the best concert I have ever been to. The band was incredible and Chris martins voice and the band are better live then on the radio . Such a beautiful experience !!!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Absolutely awesome!  If I had 1 constructive criticism it would be that I wished they played a little longer than just 2 hours.   Nonetheless…Great concert!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I’ve been a huge fan since 2000 (Parachutes), so it was long overdue that I actually see them live! It lived up to expectations and the show was fantastic. The tech and audio made me feel like I wasn’t at an outside venue. Despite the rain, the fan-driven crowded enjoyed the show and remained engaged from start to finish. It was a night I will never forget!"
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"best concert I have ever attended. The energy of the band, the lights, how Chris connected to the local audience. Everything was amazing."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This show was beyond what I imagined it would be.  It was beautiful.  It was engaging.  It was an experience I'll never forget and I'm so thankful we were able to see it.  Thank you Coldplay for putting on such a wonderful and well rounded show.  The lights were an amazing touch that continued the excitement while we heard our favorite songs!!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,It was such a good concert. Great music and the sight and sound of the pyrotechnics was amazing. Such an energetic group.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The band was amazing. We bought VIP tickets which gave us an awesome view of the stage. The led wristbands made for more visual interest.  We couldn’t find the VIP table and walked around the entire stadium. After an hour, we finally found it only for it to be closed and we therefore forfeited the extras we had paid for. When you pay extra for something you should receive it - the tables shouldn’t close before the band plays."
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Coldplay knows how to put on a spectacular concert experience.  It was my first time seeing them live and I can wait till they come back to town so we can see them again!!
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Every step of the way getting into the venue was a mess. We were led in the wrong direction by staff numerous times and the lines were a disaster. It took more than an hour from arriving at the venue to getting just inside the gate. Concert was awesome but definitely the worst experience I’ve had at a venue in terms of logistics.
6/11/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Coldplay hasn’t lost their touch!  Best concert ever!  It had everything, beach balls, confetti, interactive led bracelets, fireworks!!!

Despite the rain, Chris and the gang did not disappoint…even sing Fly Eagles Fly.  Just wish the rain would of held off for 20 more minutes so they would have played Viva LA Vida!"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Everything was so easy and smooth, from the merchandise purchase to checking in with my tickets in my phone wallet to getting to my seat! 
HER was amazing but Coldplay…. They were amazing! The sound was even better than the last time!"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was hands down the best concert I have ever been to. It's such an interactive experience - the light up bracelets (which are recyclable), the balloons, the streamers/confetti. I had the time of my life!"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was the most amazing show! Coldplay never disappoints! Chris Martin pulls the audience in and doesn’t let go, somehow making 50,000 people feel like they are at an intimate show, the band is rock solid in their performance. I was transcended to another place in time and place. Adventure of a Lifetime!"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"The show was amazing, the sound was amazing wish the merch truck showed up cause majority of the items were sold out before the first opening act"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Absolutely love Coldplay's concert, so much surprises throughout the event. Coldplay can always brings us happiness and touching music, never disappointed. You can always expect more from them, and there's always things that you cannot imagine how beautiful it will be.
Love the sound and light effects, bravo to the staffs and coordinators who made this event possible. The LED wristband really was a plus to the concert, everything became so glamorous through the lighting. And they also giveaway pins as souvenir.
Will always try to go to their concert!"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,One of the best performances I have ever seen from floor ! The light show and stars and butterflies falling from the stadium roof put the whole crowd into an emotional nostalgia.  I will never forget this experience !!!
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay sounded amazing and the wristbands that lit up were fun and brought a lot of added energy to an already great concert!
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"The most amazing show I've ever seen, I recommend a Coldplay concert to everyone, whatever age you are. It's an amazing show!"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Simply put I was blown away. 

2 excellent opening acts with H.E.R. and 070 Shake.  H.E.R. had amazing range and dynamism, while 070 shake was a distinctive stoned-trippy vibe whose music sticks with me multiple days after the concert.

Coldplay was beyond wonder though, with each and every song being amazing, having impactful moments connecting with the audience, having us put our phones away. The colours and the lights were without question the coolest part and having that on your wristband helped you feel truly involved. I had an unbelievable experience and I am oh so grateful for being there."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Oh my god I can’t even put it into words how amazing this concert was! Coldplay is such a wholesome group, you can clearly see how they care about their fans. They were the first ever concert to acknowledge the First Peoples and Traditional Territories and bring a few of them of stage before the concert started🧡 We got an amazing surprise with Bryan Adams coming on stage for a song and two great pre show performances by H.E.R. and 070 Shake. I have never had so much fun at a concert before I never wanted the night to end! Such an amazing environment was created for this beautiful concert♥️ Thank you Coldplay for putting on the best night ever!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Paid for the ticket, but didn’t receive light watch. Go to guest services and tells us people have taken 2 watches per person."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"The bracelets they gave out at the beginning of the show, I thought were going to be a keepsake, but when they started going off, it really made you feel like you were part of the show, rather than just watching it. I really had a great time and would say if you haven't been to a Coldplay concert, add it to your bucket it list!!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,So I flew from Montréal QC to see Coldplay at BC Place and WOW!! Nice stadium and my seat was perfectly placed. The only drawback was not having the fireworks! Hope I won’t need to wait another 6 years to see them again… in Canada or closer to my hometown!!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,I was in section 209 and the view was amazing. When Bryan Adams came on I could see him amazing and I could see the stage really well. The bracelets made the show shine and the lights were amazing. Her did very well and overall it was my favourite concert I have been to. 10/10 recommend
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"H.E.R exceeded expectations. Her musical talents floored me and surprise me at the same time. I would go and see her anytime to hear her sing and play.
Coldplay was just so much fun and entertaining. It was more than just a concert. It was an interactive experience."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,The best concert experience ever! Amazing! Chris Martin and Coldplay delivered on every aspect. Could not have been better!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,The most interactive concert I have ever been to. Seriously a concert everyone needs to attend in their lifetime. 100000000/10
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,I’ve dreamed of going to a Coldplay concert my entire life and this completely surpassed my expectations! It was absolutely magical and an experience I will never forget.
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Title says it all.  They are the best live band ever.  Even if they couldn't do all their pyro in Vancouver.  Second time seeing them on this tour and can't wait to see them again!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"If you’re on the fence about going to a Coldplay concert, get off of it and buy the tickets now. The band does not disappoint and must be seen!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"One of the best concert ive ever seen!
Electric performance. Coldplay did not disappoint. I wish they could have played longer. The only downside is the absence of fireworks,but its understandable."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"A lot of dancing, singing and goosebumps!!! It was soooo good!!! The concert was so organized! Just one comment from a near-sighted person like me, i hope that the VIP seats were placed by the stage where we can see Coldplay upclose and not the general admission. We paid so much just to watch on the monitor 🥺 but aside from that everything was perfect!!❤️"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a wonderful experience the best I have received there so far and I have Ben to a lot of shows there!

Helpful staff outside the venue ready to help (for me was my bag size).

No line ups to get in, no line ups for food and beverages..

The only line up was the Ladies bathroom (normal) lol..

Overall had a fantastic evening!

Side note - Coldplay was phenomenal!

I was so happy it hurt to see Bryan Adams show up as well, what a dream of an evening!

Thank you, thank you, thank you to you all!!!!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"We absolutely loved the show, high quality performances, they delivered positive energy to L of us and love to our earth! We love cold play! It has always been my dream to be at their concert!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was all that was promised and a bonus with Brian Adams participating with cold play.   I enjoyed the connection of the concert in general by bring everyone together and speaking directly to the audience with powerful music.
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Just absolutely amazing. 
Audience involvement, amazing bracelet light-show, surprise guest, commitment to sustainability and the environment.

Coldplay absolutely killed it! Already looking forward to their next show."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay was so awesome! Took both my daughters to their first concert and they had a blast! The only thing that was a little disappointing is there were no fireworks allowed due to the fire ban. Having fireworks would've brought the show to a hole new level but even without them it was amazing!!! We would see them again for sure!!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Stage presence from Coldplay was best I have ever seen in a long time in a concert. Great idea for the wrist bands changing colors!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay are true musicians and Chris Martin has endless energy. The wristbands add an extra element of fun alongside the music. Highly recommend this concert!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"We had the best experience ever. A 2 hrs singalong , unforgettable moments. We are lucky enough to be able to see them twince, and looking forward for next one. We have traveled from Toronto to Vancouver to see them, and once again, Coldplay created an amazing,  out of this world , magical night. Thank you Coldplay, see you next time."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,The energy and way that Chris connects with his audience was amazing!  I’d fly to another city again to see him perform! I also heard every top song he’s released. 🙌🙌
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a fabulous concert! Chris Martin made parts feel like an intimate performance, working the crowd like no other. Amazing light show & brilliant performance all the way around. A special surprise to see Bryan Adams perform!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"The event starts really early and stretches it out to the point of breaking before Coldplay arrive. The weak support acts inna rap group, 070 skate (or shake? Basically some girl drugged out of her mind,l and HER do well to establish the VAST chasm between opening acts and the massive superstars Coldplay have become.

As someone who has followed the band avidly since the release of X&Y, this was a bucket list item that just had to happen. Flew from Pakistan to Toronto, then from Toronto to Vancouver just for this event. The set list comprised of the classics as well as some fan-service songs and some of the newer works, which definitely take some time to get used to. Watching your favourite bad parade around in alien Masks and singing to an odd dll isn't easy on the eye, and the songs that accompanied them were bang average.

But I came for the classics and that I got. Paradise, The Scientist, Yellow, Clocks, A Sky Full of Stars, and of course, Fix You. From playing the matter and the first one in my room to seeing the band perform them on stage was a dream come true. Chris's energy is infectious and it did the impossible - pulled the crowd back from the brink after those infuriatingly mediocre opening acts. The wait was longer than normal too. I got there at 3pm to get floor views at rhe very front, so my feet were dead by the end.

I wish there were some of the songs from the albums in the middle, such as X&Y, but they weren't understandably skipped for the newer material, since that's what the band will automatically promote. The original alt rock sound has changed a lot in recent works, but somehow the spirit of the band remains intact. While AHFOD and MOTS aren't albums I'd re-listen to, the older stuff is always something that pulls me back, and I'll definitely attend a concert again whenever I get the chance."

6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay always puts on the best show with amazing guests. If you have never been - it’s a must see. We will not miss another concert of theirs!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"If you never go to another concert in your life, life isn’t complete without a Coldplay concert.  Such a socially conscious group, vibrant, pulsating show with lights and fire and confetti, showing off their incredibly talented music and skills.  Truly memorable!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great show. Sound system was good, crowd control professional and lighting wrist watches was brilliant. Show finished on time before the trains stopped. The staff all over the venue were welcoming."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,I saw them 20 years ago in London when they had been together a few years and I have wanted to see them since. Coldplay didn’t disappoint! I was lucky to attend both nights and I will say that not only did I dance my butt off but i also found myself crying while listening to some of my favourite songs! From the first moment (well done on the land acknowledgment) to the very end - you left all us all feeling like we had just experienced a show that could be summarized in no other word than MAGIC! Thank you for putting on one hell of a show!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Absolutely amazing.  It could have all been recorded music and the production would still be worth it.  Amazing to see how they are trying to decrease their carbon footprint and giving back to environmental causes as well.  I was so sad when it was all over.
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a great show with positive vibes. It was unfortunate that they did not have enough merchandise in varying sizes, and the merchandise was a small fit. There weren’t enough pins or light up bracelets for everybody who was in attendance, which was also a shame. The music was fantastic. Coldplay are great performers and it was a great night!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was so worth it. The stage setup and lights were spectacular!! A little sad they ran out of wristbands so we didn’t get one, but being there and able to see the show made up for it. Chris was so energetic and engaging. The band was amazing. Would definitely buy tickets to see them again whenever they come back."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,It was a great concert for the entire family! It was truly a spectacle for the eyes as well as the ears! H.E.R. was a great second opener. The first opener ( don't recall her name )  not so much. She appeared to be drunk or stoned and her music was not good. Add her potty mouth to the mix and I'm not quite sure how anyone thought this was a good fit with Coldplay. It was also a treat to have Bryan Adams make a surprise visit to the stage. Coldplay was amazing.
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,This concert was by far the best one i’ve ever been to. From the opening message to the opening acts to of course Coldplay themselves. It was unbelievable. The bracelets really made it a crowd experience and it made the whole concert feel so special. 10/10 I will be going again!!!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Fireworks would've been the icing on the cake but it was unfortunate Vancouver didn't get any. Other than that, hands down Coldplay was the best concert I've been to!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Best most immersive concert i've attended at BC place. Coldplay cares so much about making a difference in our world and even their concert reflected that. Fantastic experience
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"We have such a nice time watching them last Saturday at BC place. A very talented, warm hearted performer. I love when he invited a kid to get in the stage to make a song for the lil kid’s birthday. No one compares to this band. Wish for more concerts from them."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,The most magical concert I’ve ever been to! (I’ve been to over 30). Also very inclusive and sustainable! First concert I’ve seen that has done a land acknowledgment in BC.
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Best concert!!! I have been to a lot of concerts and this one has been my best experience. I will recommend it to everyone! Love it!!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,What a fantastic show put on by Coldplay.   From the fan engagement to the extras like flashing wristbands and bouncy balls.   I have never been to a show so great!   I literally was overwhelmed.   Thank you Coldplay for stopping here!!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"It’s been my 2nd time attending their concert and they never fail to deliver. Everything is well thought of (lights, songs, choreo). It feels like you’re in another universe. It was my first time seeing them up close from the dance floor and it was epic!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay really knew how to put on a show I’ve never seen so much confetti and fun special extras in one show . It really was an unforgettable experience to be there and to experience all the songs we grew up on live.
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Quite simply the best concert I’ve ever seen. Coldplay takes things to a whole new level, so naturally engaging with the public throughout; this truly was an opportunity to party with your favourite band."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,We have had a great time. Unforgettable experience.  Coldplay is spectacular and have amazing performance. Worth spending. Kudos to the team.
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Ticket master made the event easy to access and enjoyable. Chris Martin and the band were amazing, best concert ever!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"If you EVER get the chance, don’t hesitate, buy the ticket and go!  

Master of their music, their message and their connection to their audience. 

I was on my feet from the first note and until the lights came up. A moving and soul refilling experience with 50000 of my new friends.  

A must see for everyone and a must see again if you already have …"
6/8/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was, hands down, the very best concert I've ever been to (and I've been fortunate to have been to many). Coldplay puts on an amazing show and there is always such joy and positivity in the crowd (which plays off the joy of the band). Fantastic sound and amazing performance!"
6/8/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Just their demeanour, their positive outlook and how they conveyed it and the fun spirit they brought to their performance was just some of the things that made this best concert I've ever been to. I was able to share this experience with my 16-year-old son and we just had the best time. The LED bracelets were so awesome, loved that they all turned yellow when they were about to sing Yellow."
9/7/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great performance; Coldplay really control the stage, and everyone was so high and engaged. Moreover, love how they promote sustainability and make it fun; even did a land acknowledgment, that’s really good"
7/6/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Wow Coldplay is always an amazing time. Seen them twice now and they consistently have this magical way of making you feel so positive about yourself and everyone around you. I swear I left that concert with love for all 50,000 audience members that experienced it with me. They stay humble and use their money to make positive change so it makes you feel good supporting them. A role model for all popular acts: get on the level!!!"
