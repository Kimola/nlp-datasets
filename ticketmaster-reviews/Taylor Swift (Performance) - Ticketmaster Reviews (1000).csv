1/13/25,BC Place - Vancouver,"Words are truly not enough to fully encapsulate the energy, excitement and impressiveness that was The Eras Tour. Having seen the show on 3 separate occasions (Seattle and Vancouver x2), I never grew tired of walking through those stadium gates; the eager concert goers trading friendship bracelets with everyone they saw, the sparkling outfits that you know took months and months of preparation, the Swift-themed menu items, the spontaneous singalongs...and this was all before Taylor took the stage. The show itself felt more like a fever dream than a concert. The talent, coordination, composure and athleticism required to put on such a production is something that will be studied in high regard for years to come. The set flowed immaculately and went by in a blink, despite it being 3h long. Between the inside jokes, traditions old and new and overall classic Taylor Swift dazzling energy, this was a tour made for the fans, and it did not disappoint. Truly one of the best shows I have ever had the privilege of seeing. I will remember this tour all too well in the most enchanting way. Long Live the Eras Tour <3"
12/18/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"absolutely incredible. the atmosphere & energy in the venue  was unlike anything I have ever felt before. being surrounded by fans who were happy and wanted to celebrate the final show. it was a true form of girlhood. I have never felt safer in a room of 60,000 people. Taylor and everyone involved in this show made everything so magical."
12/17/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The show was everything one could hope it would be. Entry into and security for BC Place was smooth and professional, had no problems getting drink, food, merch, and leaving afterwards. The systems put into place to move folks through every aspect were clearly well considered. Taylor and her crew were just incredible. Words cannot describe how immensely amazing the entire evening was."
12/17/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"All I can say is wow!!! My city definitely rolled out all the things for the last shows of The Eras Tour. I ended up getting a ticket to N1 from a complete stranger in Detroit. She gifted her behind the stage ticket to a lucky Swiftie🫶 

Getting into gate C was a little crazy as we had to cross over to Rogers Arena and then finally cross the street. The line went all the way back to Pacific. Although once in line it only took about 20 min to get in. 

I didn’t bother with merch as I went to Canada Place a couple of days before. Once I got to my seat I was pleasantly surprised that they had put screens up for the behind the stage seats. 

The overall vibes were awesome and the show was amazing. I’m still in awe and pinching myself that I got to go in the end. Great job BC Place and Vancouver!

Long Live The Eras Tour💕"
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Untouchable is what The Eras Tour is and was! I had the time of my life fighting dragons with everyone that was there in person, and via the grainy livestreams. While I will always always wish that many a bot didn’t get their hands on tickets to resell via third party sites, I can’t help but appreciate that Taylor and her team also offered “no view” seats for the final weekend. That said, our seats still had an incredible view with the added bonus of seeing the entire tour crew in a behind the scenes style way. We sang, shook it off, cried, cheered (1-2-3 LGB), and left glitter on the floor after the party."
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,One of the best concerts I've been to this year!! Taylor will always be amazing at what she does!
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Half of the main stage and 1/3 of the screen was BLOCKED by a light tower and lights. Yet we had NO idea of this when choosing to spend an EXTREME amount of money that we thought would give us a good clear view.
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Just incredible vibe! Taylor and anll her crew are amazing! They put an unforgettable show!
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift is magnificent. She is so beautiful and talented. She has awesome energy and she is a total entertainer. I love her.
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best tour experience even though seats were at the back the experience was the best. Taylor, Gracie and her team gave their all for the tour."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I waited so long to get tickets to The Eras Tour and let me tell you, I’m glad it happened the way it did! Taylor is an AMAZING performer. Such a great show! Cried, laughed, danced, and made memories to last forever! I will never forget this experience. Looking forward to another Taylor Swift show in the future! 10/10!"
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It's Taylor Swift. It's the Eras Tour. So of course the show itself was incredible!!! I also saw her at Levi Stadium last summer and loved it then, too.
The reason for only 4 out of 5 stars: Unfortunately for the Vancouver show, I was in section 455, and there was a light structure on the floor with pyrotechnics on top that totally blocked center stage and the center of the big screen. The only other screens were relatively small and at the top of BC Place. Because of this, me and those around me missed out on a lot. Having traveled from CA and having paid a lot for my ticket, this was pretty disappointing."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is, without a doubt, one of the most extraordinary and iconic live performances of our time. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that blends musical history, emotional storytelling, and unparalleled stagecraft into an unforgettable night. In terms of sheer spectacle and artistry, The Eras Tour is a benchmark in concert history. It’s the kind of event that leaves you thinking, “I was there.” Witnessing Taylor Swift in her prime, commanding the stage with grace, passion, and charm, is an experience that will stay with you forever. Whether you're a die-hard Swiftie or a newcomer, it’s impossible to leave the show without feeling like you've just witnessed one of the most incredible performances ever to grace the stage. Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is not just a concert—it’s an event. An event that celebrates the power of music, the joy of shared experiences, and the artistry of one of the most talented musicians of our time."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Our seats were a lot better than originally expected. Everyone around us were so happy to be there, as were we! It was an incredible experience to listen/ watch all Taylor’s hits with that many fans coming together. There was a shared spirit of kindness and generosity and fun unlike any other concert I have been to. A core memory for sure :)"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,i’ve been wanting to see taylor forever. and this dream finally came true. the seats weren’t fully behind the stage so that was good and we saw taylor a few times. BEST THINF EVER
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Every moment of December 8th is a moment I will remember. Thank you Taylor, thank you Mum, thank you to every person I met who traded bracelets and shared conversations with me. Thank you."
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Every single person I talked to was kind and friendly, and everyone was open to meeting new people and trading bracelets. I loved the music and choreography of the show. 5/5 would go again"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great concert, amazing show, one of the best. Had a wonderful time, glad Vancouver was the last show!"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best concert I have ever attended! Taylor Swift went above and beyond for her fans, playing 3 1/2 hours.  Going to a TS show is probably the most positive experience a person could have.  Everyone is happy, no judgment, people singing along, smiling and having the best times of their life.  I am grateful I attended and will never forget this experience with my daughter and my friends.  She is truly an Icon.  Thank you Taylor for the ERAS tour.  Your fans will never forget it!"
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor’s Eras Tour was a cinematic experience. The choreography, lights, songs were all carefully thought out. I only got tickets to one show and I’m grateful to have had that opportunity! The only down side for me was the man in front of me. He was too tall for my own good. At one point he had shifted down his row blocking my view of the entire stage during The Tortured Poets Department set. I didn’t say anything because his wife was having the time of her life and I didn’t want to take the chance of souring their experience. Next time, I think I’ll try and go for front row of whatever section I can get."
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The best concert I’ve been to hands down! Taylor put on such an amazing performance!
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Unbelievable show!  Taylor gives it her all for 3 1/2 hrs. Gracie was also amazing and so talented. Love that we got to see them sing together at the end of the show. Two beautiful confident talented women. Such a great example for young women everywhere.
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,A show unlike any other. Swift is unmatched in the experience she provides fans. Air will be interesting so see where she goes from here
12/12/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"My daughter and I came from L
Prince George for the last show of her tour and we experienced a seminal moment in both our lives. Everyone that we ran into from fans to staffers, security and venders we so unbelievably warm and friendly!  I was so happy, myself, that I got to dance (and hard) to some of my favourites: ‘Cruel Summer’, ‘Lover’, ‘Delicate’, ‘Are You Ready for It’ and ‘Don’t Blame Me’  and then ‘Willow’ and ‘Betty’ later on. I love Taylor Swift so I wasn’t too surprised how much I was going to enjoy her.  The real ‘magic’, for me was getting to experience the raw, unbridled emotion that poured out from my daughter when Taylor played her ‘surprise’ songs, starting with ‘New Romantics’. Seeing my daughter, Jorja, exasperated trying to catch her breath as she realized what Taylor was playing and seeing the tears stream down her face, without remission, made me lose all control and I cried inconsolably.  The bonds that were forged between dad and daughter over the entire weekend were made possible because of the flawless show that we were able to attend.  Well done Ticketmaster as well for making it so easy to redeem our on -line tickets. 
Can’t wait to do another Ticketmaster event , hopefully sooner than later; 
Sincerely Ryan McMaster, Prince George, BC"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The Eras Tour was AMAZING! A 3 1/2 hour show with only max 3 minutes in between eras. I don’t think any concert will top that for me!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved the concert! But getting tickets is what was very hectic. Also the prices were very extreme even for other artists not to mention when others were re selling them. Need a better solution and system. The concert though was an amazing experience and feel so lucky I got to experience it. I hope I’m just as lucky to go the next time
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,By far the best concert I have ever witnesses. Taylor Swift knows how to rock the stage.  Plus BC Stadium in Vancouver was an outstanding venue.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"One of the best performances I’ve ever seen. The singing, the dancers, the band, the production, it all was amazing."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was awesome and everything I thought it would be. Taylor Swift put on a great show.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We attended the last Taylor Swift Concert in Vancouver. It was a ""great show""but, it felt more like a stage-show on Broadway - very scripted. Taylor Swift appeared like she was going through the motions, and there was no personal engagement with the crowd. Her comments were the same across the three nights in Vancouver. No comment about it being her last show, rather a general comment about the end of Eras Tour. It felt like the ""elephant in the room""within the stadium - the last show of the Eras Tour, but no acknowledgement of this. This seemed like a running commentary as we left the stadium.

The show lacked the spontaneity and involvement of other concerts. This was dissapointing. She appeared understandably done with the tour. But, perhaps it's lengthiness was too much. I would have been happy with less of a production and more of the great singer she is."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"All I can say is it was simply the best 🫶🏻💕. Taylor, her band, dancers, everyone... The stadium, staff and security… all of it was done so well! An unforgettable night."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Most amazing concert performed by THE best artist of our generation, her wonderful band/back-up singers and absolute top-dancers. Performance of a lifetime!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Attended three Eras Tours and was beyond chuffed to be there for the “Farewell” Era 😢 My life is so much better off for these opportunities 🫶🏻 Money can be made, but there’ll only be on Eras Tour ❤️"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Night 3 in Vancouver. Final show, awesome vibes with an incredible atmosphere. TSwift is amazing live."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was amazing and did not matter where you sat!  The merchandise was okay but they fell very short on the blue crew necks
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Was such a great show and performance! Was so worth the whole experience I hope she comes again! I’d bring the whole family! Everyone who wasn’t a swiftie defiantly became one after the concert
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was a good concert. Great stage, performance. But was more entertained at a slipknot concert."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved this show taylor put on an amazing performance and had the crowd amazed
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The Eras Tour was my first concert. And it was literally magical. The high this concert gave will be hard to compare to now that I move on to shorter/shorter budget concerts. Taylor did a great job! Can’t wait to see what else she will do after she gets the very well deserved break she needs!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I cannot believe how amazing this concert and tour was. I brought my daughter and wife and we will never forget it!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Amazing concert. Fast lines going in and out of the stadium. Food and drinks not overpriced. Great execution!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We were so lucky to get tickets in one of the pre-concert drops to the final show on Dec 8.

Taylor was amazing and the crowd was absolutely electric."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Finding the words to encapsulate my eras tour experience seems impossible but I’m going to do my best because I feel like I have to say something. Like everyone else, I tried to get tickets for this tour at every opportunity. My friends and I were willing to go anywhere at any time as long as we could get tickets, but it didn’t work out over and over again. One last time I registered for verified fan when the Vancouver dates were released. Once again I got waitlisted, but while on a work trip to Toronto I got a text in the airport that I was cleared from the waitlist and suddenly the moment I was chasing for over a year was right in front of me. I surprised my best friend with these tickets for her birthday 3 weeks after I bought them with custom friendship bracelets with the show date and location. Fast forward 1 year and 29 days and there we are in Vancouver for the last ever eras tour show. Everything worked out exactly the way it was meant to and I feel that in my soul. I’ll never get over being about to be part of the cultural movement that was the eras tour, from talking my about every detail of the show with my friends, going to see the movie in theaters, trading friendship bracelets with girls at brunch before the show to spending hours and hours and hours bedazzling a body suit to wear to the show, to finally experiencing it live with my best friends. Thank you Taylor Swift, for existing in the same timeline as me and for bringing the magic and joy of girlhood to an all time high and giving us all the confidence and self worth to exist as our truest and most authentic selves. I laughed, I cried (a lot), and embraced the women in my life I love so much.  And I can confidently say, I have been changed for good."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Getting to see the ERAS Tour on the last night was the greatest experience of my life. I just can’t believe how lucky I am to have gotten tickets. I would 100/10 recommend seeing Taylor in concert! She’s amazing!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was magical! A great show, memories were made! I will think about this for the rest of my life."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Bittersweet but a Taylor never disappoints! Loved every second of it. The costumes, the choreography, the set list, our Surprise Songs, the fans, Vancouver!!!, the list continues…all these and many more absolutely slayed!!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I’ve been a big fan since I was in middle school which is 10+ years ago! I’ve been to every concert she’s had since speak now and I plan to for the rest of my life!!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The energy was over the top! Taylor Swift has made an historic event with a show like never seen before!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"getting into the arena was a bit difficult. there were long snaky lines throughout many parts of downtown vancouver. while i understand a large amount of people have to get through a small opening at the same time, i felt this could’ve been handled better, especially since it was the third (and final) night. for instance, a guard was directing foot traffic through cones and caution tape, while stating that sometimes the other gate (gate h) opens up, but she had no idea when it would. when i was about to the front of gate b, gate h suddenly opened, causing a slew of concert goers to rush over and disrupt the coned off line. there were also no lights around this part of the stadium, causing a bit of a safety issue as there are many stairs. i felt the overall foot traffic could’ve been directed better, as this was the final night in the city with the same amount of crowd. i completely understand that many concert goers were uninformed, standing around, causing and incredible inconvenience for those actively fighting to get into a line, but a stronger presence of direction could’ve resolved this issue. for instance, an email explaining gate information, times, and closures would’ve been helpful for those who have never visited the city. clear ‘start’ signs to show where lines begin would’ve also been helpful since may were traveling from all street directions. an appropriate amount of gates open to better control the influx of foot traffic also would’ve been confident. overall, staff did a great job of trying to control the crowd, but a little more guidance would’ve been helpful. thank you to all who made this experience possible!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Thank you, Taylor, for sharing your talent with the world. This show was amazing. Just three hours of non-stop action performed with nothing but love and joy. I am honored and blessed to have been there, and for the rest of my life I will remember it all."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I loved every moment of the show!! It was so packed though I’m definitely going to stream it soon to reminisce on this experience.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was our second time going to the Eras
Tour. We were so happy to be there the final show. It was just as amazing as the first time we went. A well done show with fantastic energy and performances."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Eras Tour was the most amazing experience. Taylor and her crew put on a truly magnificent concert that left fans changed. It is hard to put into words how phenomenal it was. Truly, I hope I carry those memories with me in my entire life. I’m so glad I got to be a part of this historic and iconic event."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I had behind the stage seating with no obstructions. The screen was right there which was nice, but since there was one screen and it had been programmed to mostly show the backgrounds and supporting graphics for each of the eras, we often didn’t get to see what Taylor was doing. The Jumbotron screen facing us was blank, which I thought was too bad because it would’ve helped us be able to see more of her performance while still seeing the backgrounds."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Thank you Taylor for creating such a loving, fun, and amazing atmosphere. You allowed us to dance, sing, cry, and all share the most magical moments with you and somehow, in this crazy world, all 160,000 of us this weekend, were like family. You made something so huge seem so intimate. You made something beautiful and you changed the world with this tour."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Best experience of my life. I am grateful i was able to get the $16 no stage view tickets at first and i tried again to get “ better “ seats and i finally did! I Got floor tickets and that is what made my experience even better. Seats were amazing almost close to the stage! I am just glad i got to finally experience The Taylor Swift Eras Tour Concert as my first ever concert! Thank you Ticketmaster and most importantly Big Thanks to Taylor and her Whole Crew involved! MAYBE for next time lower the prices a tad more lower.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I think Taylor's concert has a very obvious flaw, especially if you see it more than once. The biggest issue is that it actually ends. I hope the singer takes this seriously and works on it. A concert that eventually comes to an end? Truly disappointing."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,City of Vancouver did a great job on being organized and ready for us. Too few merch sale locations and frequently sold out. Concert was AMAZING! BC Place was ready and organized. Was a fun weekend!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Cannot say enough about the show, it was a once in a lifetime experience!  That said, I know that we were some of the lucky ones able to get tickets locally.  The majority of the crowd was people who had travel to attend.  I wish there were more available for locals to buy and attend. So many people tried and tried to get tickets and were unsuccessful yet there were many we talked to who have seen multiple shows and had travelled to see the last ones here.  
The resale prices were ridiculously high which was also a disappointment. It priced so many out of buying tickets."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I went to the final show of the Eras tour and it was no less than magical! I’m still singing dancing and bringing that energy into every aspect of my life and the world! So glad I went to the Tampa show on April 14, 2023 and the last show in Vancouver December 8, 2024. I love good music!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was an amazing concert. The line ups were massive, not too many health options for food. The merch line ups were insane. Happy to see additional bathrooms available for the extra female attendants. But the bathroom line was still insane."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor’s concert was the most amazing concert I have ever attended, and I have seen many legends over the decades, or Eras of my life. Taylor began on time and never stopped entertaining us for 3 1/2 hours. Even when she was doing quick costume changes we were entertained with amazing dancers and beautiful graphics. The huge screen let everyone feel like we were much closer. It was such an energetic performance, and Taylor made us feel so special for turning out to see her, she loves performing and appreciates her fans. The enthusiasm of the crowd was so contagious, everyone was happy, friendly and kind. An amazing,  positive evening I’ll always remember. What a STAR!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,My daughter and I had the best time I knew it was gonna be a good show but never in 1 million years did I think it would be the best thing I’ve ever seen in an incredibly magical experience
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Literally the best show that ever existed. I have been to hundreds of concerts and have never before attended something so magical. The crowd, the environment, the set, the setlist—it was all incomparable. Will live rent free in my head for all eternity"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift gives her all in her performances. A true artist. The venue was good although the offerings of food and drinks were not great. And after receiving a note that bags had to be a certain size- I brought that size of bag that fit just my phone and credit cards. As we tried to go through the gate I was accosted 5 times by people insisting my bag was too big and would have to check it for $40. I was clearly not happy.  Thankfully the concert was perfect!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The entire concert experience was truly incredible. The environment was safe and welcoming and well organized. The show was just beyond incredible. This was the best concert experience I've had!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"fantastic show. 3.5 hours flew by. The Eras tour will be a cultural touchstone in the future, and I'll be glad to say I was there at the last show."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor is an incredible performer putting on a high energy show for 3+hours with minimal breaks. Her production is on another level. The visuals, sound, and overall experience was phenomenal. This is one of the best live shows I’ve ever seen, and I hope on day I can experience her live again."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"More food options, all fried sadly- the concert in itself a million stars ⭐️"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"From the city of Vancouver to the concert itself everything was amazing! The crowds were controlled perfectly for seamless entry, extra SkyTrains were added for smoothness going home. Taylor is the best you will ever see!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I’m so thankful to have been there at the final curtain call. I wish we had a special guest but it didn’t take away from the absolute magic.

Such a tease when Jan rose from below stage for Fortnight. We thought it was Post Malone for a heartbeat 🤣

The night had all the songs, dancing, merch lines and friendship bracelet trading you would have expected. 💕"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Simply the greatest concert of all time! I don't know how she does it, she is a superhero! Taylor Swift the woman you are!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Amazing. Wonderful. There aren’t words to describe a Taylor Swift concert! Thank you to Taylor and her entire team, staff, everyone involved."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor swift is absolutely amazing live! Everything went smoothly through ticket master. If you have a chance to see a Taylor Swift, take it!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Went for TAYCOUVER N1 and my mind was blown ! MOTHER MOTHERED.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The error is to will forever go down in history as one of the most memorable events that have experienced with my daughter.  The amount of love and light and joy that the concert brought to us is indescribable.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The phenomena that she is, Taylor Swift did not disappoint and nor she would have. The biggest surprise is the with the ease of booking tickets however long you had to wait in the waiting room. Once you get those tickets it’s a feeling you can’t describe. The ground staff handling the check-in to the Vancouver Police Department and all other volunteers thank you for making such a grand show look so easy. Crowd management was at it top notch, no words just gratitude."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I attended the final show. Spent the whole weekend in Vancouver and it was an experience of a lifetime! I feel like I left that stadium having just attended the largest group therapy session ever. I can’t put it into words how magical it was. Thank you Taylor, I will forever defend you against the haters in this world!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We had seen Taylor at the beginning of the eras tour and wanted to see her again after she released TTPD.   That part was fantastic.  However, we learned that our show (the very last show of the tour)  was 20 minutes shorter than the night before and also didnt include a Gracie Abrams duet like the night before.  In fact, my daughter noticed she didnt speak to the crowd very much and she was right.  I understand Taylor was exhausted Im sure at the end of eras, as she should be, but it felt like she was already gone.  That being said, the Venue and Vancouver were amazing.  They put a Taylor lit sign and friendahip bracelet installation all over the city.  What a wonderful surprise!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Being there for closing night was so incredibly special 🫶🏼 I’ll remember that night forever
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert lived up to all the hype. It exceeded my expectations. Taylor is the ultimate performer. The whole experience was epic.
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I am in awe of her and the Eras Tour! Ultimate experience of a lifetime
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The past almost two years have been the great for a reason, OUR beloved eras tour. I have attended each of Taylor Swift’s tours through her career, but this one just superseded them all. Attending the tour closing night was an emotional experience, but as they say all good things must come to an end. Thank you to our queen for being a superhuman being and giving us everything since March of 2023. I dare anyone to, “Try and come for her job,” to paraphrase this genius. I love you Taylor Swift and I was lucky to experience this tour so many times. It was indeed the end of the ERAS, but the start of an age💜"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,the atmosphere is like nothing ive ever experienced

12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This show was incredible! Worth every penny. Smooth entry. Great staff. Friendly. Taylor put on an incredible concert. More than 3 hours. Fantastic!
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Absolutely phenomenal show! The entire sadium was ablaze with pure joy, passion and kindness!! I will never regret going to a Taylor Swift concert but I would have regretted not getting to experience the once in a lifetime Era’s Tour!! So thankful I was able to get a ticket through a friend to see the 3 1/2 hour performance Taylor gave night after night for a year and a half! She never does anything half way but she far exceeded herself this time! Just an amazing, spectacular show! Her voice, her personality, the detailed performances for each song, the digital displays on the screens and floors, the light up bracelets we are given that flash different colors to the music, her beautiful outfits, her amazing dancers, her talented band, the vibes!! 100/100 Best experience ever and a night I will never forget!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Taylor Swift Era’s Tour was the best concert I have ever been to and the most joyous experience I have ever had. The 3.5 hour long show went by ‘in the blink of a crinkling eye’, and I never wanted it to end. Forever and always a fan!"
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift was unbelievable!! Totally amazing. Loved her interaction with the crowd!  My $30 ticket did not disappoint!
Wish more concerts were that reasonable."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We bought what we thought would be great seats. Section B6 on the floor 20
Rows from the stage.  Unfortunately due to the height of the stage and very tall people in front we couldn’t see a thing.  Not even the video screen very well.  

I’m 5”7’ and my wife 5”4’.  We’re just too short for floor seats."
12/11/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Legend. Extraordinary. Once in a lifetime experience.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor was amazing!  The positive energy throughout the crowd is incredible. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I have to say that Taylor and her team worked their butt off! By far the best concert that I have ever attended. We waited a whole year and it was well worth the WAIT!!!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Had a beautiful time w my birthday girl daughter-could not have celebrated 19 any better. Canada was an amazing place. Sad for tm unable to control the bots and the price gauging making it impossible for many.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift is such a class act. She is a fantastic performer who entertained the crowd for over 3 hours without an intermission. My daughter and i had an epic time at this concert. I can not say enough positives about this experience.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Loved getting a verified fan offer with amazing seats to see Taylor! Thank you Ticketmaster for enabling such a great experience!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Eras Tour was everything I dreamed of and more. Absolutely amazing, we had a side stage view and the band was so interactive and made the experience even better"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,We tried and tried to get a presale code and finally secured one for Vancouver through help of a friend. The concert was everything we had hoped and we hope she tours again soon!!!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Such a great show!! Loved everything about it. Was so nice how on time everything was with the opener, Gracie Abrams and then when Taylor Swift came on not too longer after!! Amazing show!!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great vibe, friendly crowd, amazing stage entertainment. Taylor was outstanding and her voice plus instrumentals were insane. Gracie was so good and I had not really heard many of her songs prior to the concert. I would go to any Taylor Swift concert I could again. Would prefer to pay FaceValue for tickets in the future. It was a once in a lifetime event for my daughter and me to share."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"First, I would like to tell that the concert was perfect. Taylor is an amazing singer and her and her team’s performance was impeccable. However, I am very disappointed with Ticketmaster sales, because my family and I couldn’t be able to join any queue. Although there are a bunch of people who can get tickets and resale those for extremely overpriced costs. It is very unfair. Since I thought that Ticketmaster’s register fans policy was to avoid resales and scams."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"ERAS tour was outstanding! Couldn’t have imagined how great it was and how special it was to share the night with my daughter! Ticketmaster could have done a much better job regulating ticket sales as I was verified and could never get in the queues, which was likely responsible for the price gauging that happened to all of us fans!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,An amazing experience that we will never forget. Taylor is an unbelievable performer.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We had an amazing experience from start to finish.  All the details throughout Vancouver, the organization and speed of entrance into BCPlace, the actual concert.  
Gracie and Taylor were both phenomenal.  The visual experience was just as fantastic as the performance.  
It was so well done.  Would not have changed a thing."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We paid extra for floor tickets. Unfortunately, it was really challenging to see anything at all due to the lay out of the floor. Additionally, many people were allowing their children to stand on the seats which made it near impossible to see the show. There were people with signs stating not to stand on the seats walking up and down the isles but nothing was enforced and there were several children standing on seats. I had children with me as well and wouldn’t allow them on the seats which made them pretty upset seeing all the other kids do it, and they couldn’t even see the screen due to others standing on the seats."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Thank you so much ticket master for picking up my email address for the Eras tour pre sale(VANCOUVER) last year … You made my girls really really happy, best day ever to see Taylor Swift concert..they have a great time singing and dancing… forever grateful and thankful for this amazing experience.. thank you again.."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,We had the best time at T Swift. Easy to get in and out of BC Place.  Everyone was happy and friendly and the washrooms were always clean.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Life changing. Saw the ERAS tour three times and wish I could have gone many more. Still think Ticketmaster could do more to guarantee tickets make it into the fans hands, not AI & scalpers. Resale prices were staggering and so many people were unable to see the show because of these sky high costs."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This night was sparkling! No one puts on a show like my girl Taylor! So grateful to be in the Swiftie Community! I was lucky enough to go to the first show on March 17th and the 2nd to last on December 7th and it was truly on honor to witness first hand the growth of the show! Thank you Taylor!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I had floor seats in section B5 on the FINAL NIGHT OF THE ERAS TOUR. Row 4- the dream seats. Center stage. And the professional filmographer almost completely blocked the concert for most of us in seats 6-10. (He was lined up with the main walkway). The only time we got a clear view of the stage is when the filmographer dropped down as Taylor came downstage.

Most of our section were short girls, and we couldn't even see the big screen a lot of the time. Some gave up and just sat down. 

Overall, the Taylor was excellent and thankfully there was a screen kind of overhead that I could look up to for most of the concert! It was just a bummer to have those seats and then not have them be as good as they should have been"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was the concert of a lifetime!  I’ll remember for the rest of my life!

Purchasing tickets however was a completely different experience.  The various drops for verified fans was puzzling as a verified fan I had no access to any of the drops.  Maybe Ticketmaster can improve the purchasing system for Taylor’s next tour."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This was a phenomenal show from anywhere you sat!!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Definitely a once in a lifetime experience! Would 100% go again
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,It was an amazing concert. Glad I went. I don't like it when talent lets the crowd cheer or screech for them for a long time without stopping it. I don't need to go deaf. The wrist lights were an amazing idea. The opening act needed a better sound check. I could not make out the lyrics of her songs. I wasn't the only one around me that couldn't make out what she was saying. While waiting for the concert to start I thought they could of done better with the Taylor footage. I couldn't hear a lot of what she was saying and I did not want to see her in a mask. She looked beautiful and I loved all of her costume changes.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I've listened to Taylor Swift since she released her debut album and subsequent albums since. I called myself a casual Swiftie at best or simply a listener, however, until I went to Santa Clara N2. The Eras Tour profoundly changed my life. You don't realise how many events of your personal or professional life are intertwined and intersect with Swift's works until the opening of her concert, finding yourself overwhelmed with a surge of emotions abruptly. It reminds you she's not simply someone on the other side of your headphones.

I typically only go to concerts at small jazz venues. Do you wave? That feels weird. I guess this is why she wrote TTPD, a masterpiece of her lived experiences—the crowd was chanting ""more"". When she tours again, I'll dance my feelings out again, be done with school (I decided to go back during her Speak Now set at Santa Clara), and remember this beautiful end of a 149-concert run in Vancouver with my friends."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Was lucky enough to see Eras 1&2. Seeing it 2nd time with my daughter -priceless
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Incredible concert! The must upbeat concert and amazing atmosphere and incredible performance.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The most spectacular concert… 3.5 hours long with so many songs, effects, and amazing energy. Surprise songs made it even better!!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"if I could put 10 stars I would, this concert was one of the best things I ever attended to.  I went with my 13 year old daughter who cried of joy the whole time, it was so emotional, I am so grateful to had the privilege to attend, I don't regret the enormous amount of money I spent, it was so worth it. Thank you Taylor for the memories,"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This was 4.5 hours of pure entertainment. Best concert I've ever been to.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was more than just a concert. It was pure joy, safe, life changing. To be with 60,000 swifties having the time of our lives … it’s indescribable :)"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Literally THE GREATEST AND BEST CONCERT OF MY LIFE, from a quality standpoint. The stage design as well as visual effects on the jumbotron being in sync with all of the dance sequences, the costume changes, all of that stuff! I don't think anyone will come even remotely close to even rivaling, let alone topping this Eras Tour. My ticket was so worth the money!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Amazing, well worth it. Would do it again. I wish I would’ve gone multiple nights."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I was fortunate enough to get cheap tickets from another swiftie two days before the second last show on the tour! It was the best concert experience I have been to. From the sound to the venue to the crowd control everything was great. Made memories that I will forever hold close to my heart 🫶
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was perfect.  Made beautiful memories with my daughters.  Taylor Swift is the ultimate performer.  We had 3rd row seats and were able to stand by the stage per her tour manager.  What an incredible experience.  Kudos to Taylor Swift and her performers and staff - One of kind!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Overall, Taylor Swift’s concert was an unforgettable experience that transcended a mere music show; it was a celebration of artistry, connection, and the joy of sharing memories with fellow fans. If you have the chance to see her live, don't hesitate—you will walk away with a heart full of memories and an experience that you'll cherish forever. This concert was not just the biggest of the year; it was a moment in time that will be remembered for years to come!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour in Vancouver was an absolute blast! It wasn’t just a concert, it was a magical journey through her music. Taylor’s energy and generosity were on full display, and fans left feeling like they had a special connection with her. She poured her heart, soul, and every last note into the show, and it was truly unforgettable.

For over three hours, Swift commanded the stage with all her might. Whether she was pouring her heart out on the piano or leading a dance party, she had us all on our feet. Her voice was strong and powerful throughout, even though the show was super intense. Few artists can keep up with such a high-energy performance while still showing emotion in every song. Swift also made sure to shine a spotlight on her band, dancers, and crew. She showed them how much she appreciated their hard work and dedication, which made it clear that The Eras Tour wasn’t just about her success; it was a celebration of everyone involved. 

Overall, an incredible show, an incredible night. 10/10"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The lights, energy, positivity, music, visuals… it was all magical. An absolutely incredible and unforgettable concert experience. Security was also spectacular."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,She was amazing. Played for 3 and a half hours. Never made me bored once. Every one of the dancers were amazing and never once made obvious mistakes. The music was amazing. I miss it all!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was incredible. I have no words. Taylor is a Goddess. Everything was just amazing. The singing the attire, the set, just wow. I was sad when it ended."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Went to night 2 and it was an unforgettable night! It was rare and we were there!!!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This night was sparkling, never let it go.  I was there, it was rare!!! 
The most spectacular show that will live rent free in my memories forever."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Best concert ever. Will never be able to top this event.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Somehow managed to exceed the high expectations I had going in. I feel indebted to Swift for helping us create a piece of family (my daughter and dad--who's been a Swiftie from the beginning!--joined me) and be part of music history. And BC Place was a fantastic venue--amazing acoustics, facilities and staff!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I am at a loss of words for how incredible this concert was. Fastest 3 hours of my life.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a wonderful event. From the venue to the set, the opening act by Gracie Abrams and of course Taylor swift. She was mesmerizing in her performances. It’s amazing the energy she exudes right till the very end. It’s definitely a one of a kind concert."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"i love you taylor can’t believe i got one of the 16,50$ ticket with a insane view (section 422 in vancouver)"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,It was absolutely amazing and lived up to the hype 💯!
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Cried in quality and quantity; in every era. Her team is incredibly professional and organized. Miss TS Mother herself is phenomenal beyond words can express, we'll probably have to collectively write a song for her. I'm incredibly lucky to experience this once in a lifetime cultural event, with millions of adoring, empowered women! Cannot wait for the next era T_T"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Concert was great, would definitely do again if not costing a kidney, thankfully I still had 2 before the show. Price gouging by all involved was the only downside of my experience."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was the best concert I have ever attended.  You could not beat the friendly, fun atmosphere and Taylor is a champion for giving us over three hours of incredible entertainment."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"BC place was incredible, and it goes without saying Taylor put on a spectacular and memorable show."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This was my first Taylor Swift concert and it was incredible - the experience of being part of the night was wonderful.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"There should be more signage outside the venue directing attendees to the correct gates. Also, we waited in line for two hours to buy concert merch after waiting outside the venue to enter. We arrived at 4pm for a 7pm show and missed the opening act. Not well organized."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This was the most incredible show I have ever been to and may ever go to.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Best show I’ve ever seen. She truly is amazing how she can perform for that long. She engages with the vans and truly makes it worth your while compared to others that just get out and treat it like a job. She is truly deserving of the best artist of the year.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The absolute joy and happiness the show brought to my heart cannot be described with words. I was a fan of Taylor’s before seeing her I concert, but now I can call myself a certified S W I F T I E!! She (and her back up performers) are absolutely brilliant. The production was out of this world. But my favorite was being packed in a stadium with beautiful women (and men) everywhere. All were there for the same reason - no permission was needed to dance like on one in watching, become their authentic selves, and scream Taylor’s music at the top of their lungs in complete expression. This show is an experience that I will never forget. Love you TS! Thank you for everything you represent in this world."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,We all loved it. Vancouver really showed up and Taylor is a phenomenal talent.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This concert was legendary. I’m so lucky I was able to get tickets, but I’m hoping next time I get a verified fan code. Please recognize I’m a true fan, that’s all I ask for. Ty!!!!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Your wildest dreams will come true. =)
Taylor knows how to put on the most beautiful, jaw-dropping, spectacular show.
She is a truly legendary musician, lyricist, and performer."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was a concert that created memories of a lifetime.   Taylor was absolutely amazing, the venue was fabulous with well organised teams making sure everyone got to where they were going and so smooth with the electronic ticketing for entering BC Place.  Vancouver was an amazing host - so much to do and see around downtown it was all walkable ."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor is amazing! I went all 3 nights and all 3 views were wonderful. Best experience ever! I would have gone to every show around the world if that was possible. 🫶😍🐍🍁🇨🇦❤️
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The whole show was absolutely incredible and the organization in each country was amazing. The venues selected ensured that te visuals and sound gave us the public something we will remembee always
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We attended the December 7th show in Vancouver BC!  This night will never be forgotten!  What a magical night!  One for the ages!  We and our girls were enchanted and will never forget this night!  Taylor continues to shine with her talents, generosity, humor, and friendship felt by millions. Thank you, Taylor! Deb, Lisa, Paityn, and Jade, Salt Lake City, Utah!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor is the best entertainer there is, hands down! She is so creative and talented. I don’t think any other concert can top the Eras Tour. No other artist can do what she does. Over 4 hours she was on that stage. Dancing and singing and sounded beautiful doing it. Plus, the love that she has created amongst her fans is unbelievable."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The Taylor swift concert was by far the best I’ve seen. It was not only a concert but an overall experience of people of all ages. She is an incredible performer. Her crew and production was top tier.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Made the trek from VA to Vancouver to take my Swiftie daughters to see N2 on 12/7. It was amazing. I’ve been my fair share of concerts, and this surpassed anything I’ve ever seen with regards to showmanship, duration, and sheer mastery.  I’m so glad we got to witness this performance.  I will treasure the memories"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,i had the best day of my life and everything went very smoothly and my tickets were easy to access
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It's more than a concert. It was the getting ready before, choosing our best outfits, trading bracelets, meeting other fans. The concert its self is a feeling like none other, the pure joy and excitment of an OG Swiftie is one to none. Best Concert of my life."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Wonderful experience!   Vancouver was welcoming and a great venue to wrap the Eras tour
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Eras Tour was magnificent. Never been to a concert with so much joy and happiness surrounding me before. BC Place was a great venue, very organized, and safe."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"taylor, as always, was amazing. what wasn’t amazing was the process of obtaining tickets. verified fan is just another loop real fans have to jump through AND still compete with scalpers. not only this, but when additional tickets did drop, we’d either be let in to buy them but no tickets would be remaining, or we wouldn’t be let in at all!! too much of a fight for tickets led to an unreasonable demand. for a tour this big, it should have been dealt with better"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Best concert of my life! I loved every second of it.
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Amazing, fantastic experience. Except for the merchandise line, that was ridiculous."
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We saw the Dec. 6th show in Vancouver and it did not disappoint! It was my daughter and my first time seeing Taylor Swift and she is hands down the best performer ever! The entire show was amazing! Cannot wait to hopefully see her again in the future, and actually get tickets from Ticketmaster so we don’t pay an arm and a leg!

We flew to Austria in August and were devastated we did not get to see her, but grateful everyone was safe! Didn’t think it was possible to see her, but we managed to pull it together for this show to finish what we started, and so thankful it all worked out! Love you Taylor!"
12/10/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Hands down highlight of my year ✨ Most amazing, entertaining, emotional concert I have ever experienced! Taylor is absolutely gorgeous inside and out 🩷"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The most special experience at a show that I have ever had. I glad I spent the money and the time to go to one of her shows.

12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Even if I didn’t hear one of my top three desired surprise songs, I would have said this show was amazing and life changing - because it was. I wish I could go to more!!! So happy to have had this chance 🫶🏻"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,What can you say about The Eras Tour? It was magnificent. It felt like a fever dream and went so fast. Taylor is the utmost professional and the crowds were infectiously friendly and excited. How she can go that hard for 3.5 hours without any breaks is astonishing.  It was unforgettable and I hope to see her in the next era.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"First concert, and best concert I have ever been to! Taylor makes you feel like you are going through time with her songs, and the nostalgia feeling comes right back to when you were in high school! This kinda concert will never come around again, and I was so happy to be apart of it!! 10/10!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The atmosphere around and at this concert was incredible. The lighted signs all over and attention to detail throughout the city created one of the best events ever.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The show was amazing, but it is CRIMINAL how much it costs to go to a concert through Ticketmaster."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I am speechless - can’t wait for the next era! Taylor you are incredible!
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The whole performance was phenomenal.  Me, my sister, and cousins were so lucky to get the tickets.  It's the best concert we've ever seen.  Love everything about it: friendship bracelets, sparkly outfit, Taylor's dancers and back up singers.  Taylor's energy is beyond compare. Performing non stop for 3 1/2 hours was unbelievable. She is beautiful, talented, kind hearted, amazing! It's all worth it.  This experience is once in a lifetime.  I will treasure it. I love you, Taylor 💜"

12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,concert was incredible. had the night of my life. if only i could have had seats with a view of the stage that’s the only thing that would have made it better! my experience with ticketmaster was another story. impossible to get tickets for this concert and ended up with no view seating as the only ticket which my aunt got for me while so many resellers got in for better tickets. hopefully next time you can figure out how to ensure real fans get tickets especially when a concert is in such high demand.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,What an incredible show where love was in the air! Sound was excellent! Visual effects & performance of the entire team were a delight !
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"bracelets, audience engagement, stellar setlist. you name it."

12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift was one of the best concerts I have seen! It was myself and my 15 year old daughter’s first time seeing her.

We had so much fun! The stage, costumes, music, performances by Taylor and her backup singers and dancers were amazing! Taylor and her crew had so much energy! I loved how the stage had different projections on it for different songs and the middle platform stage moved up and down during the show. 

I wish I could go again!

Meeting other fans and exchanging friendship bracelets with them was so much fun."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Floor was great for hanging out. As a short person I'd have seen more higher up though! Fun regardless. 

To the group standing in front of me - the group of 4 people where every person, in a row, blocked the view of the people behind them holding up your cellphones because each of you, individually, wanted to record your very own video of the concert (not even taking turns among you who records each song) and thus maximally blocking the people behind you - in future, please don't? It meant I (and others) saw even less. :("
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Leading up to the concert the communications from Ticketmaster were great, really  informative and fed the anticipation and excitement.  The concert was amazing, awesome, wonderful!   So much energy in the stadium and so much fun.    The opening act was really good and Taylor Swift was fantastic!    

The event was well organized and well managed.   Everyone was patient and so happy to be there.

The best Friday night ever!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I am so thankful that I was chosen as a verified fan to be able to attend the Eras tour concert in Vancouver.

12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift put on an amazing experience for my family and I.  What a show!  Hope she performs again in the future soon!
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The culture Taylor creates is something that you can only feel when you are surrounded by 65,000 fans mostly women. Trading bracelets, giving eachother sparkle tattoos, tissues of your crying. It was therapy being there and was the most amazing concert. You have to see it to feel it."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,BEST concert of my life!!!! Taylor and her team put one heck of a show!!

12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Words truly cannot describe the experience that The Eras Tour is. This show allowed for a once in a lifetime trip with my daughter and after the year we had, I was needed and I am so grateful for it. BC Place was filled with amazingly kind staff and the artists, dancers, and crew put on a show that I dont know how they can too (I’m sure Taylor can but this was excellent and fun)."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was really worth the hype! From the production, dancers, band and of course Taylor Swift - they all did their best to pull off this spectacular show."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Although the process to get tickets was a disaster and now tickets are now sold than the list price… Ticketmaster has a long way to go with this process.
Taylor Swift, and The Eras tour is simply one of the best shows ever put on. Gracie Abrams was fantastic. Taylor’s show was perfectly curated from start to finish one of the best performers of our time."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift knows how to put on a great concert! From her gorgeous outfits, awesome sets, catchy choreography to her talented guitar and piano skills, Taylor is a true superstar! We sang and danced to so many songs from all of her Eras and the energy of the crowd was magical. Her acoustic set really showcased her musical and lyrical talent. Taylor Swift will never “go out of style!” This concert was my daughter and I’s “wildest dreams” come true and was the “best day”. Ending with the perfect song and fireworks, Karma! Thank you Taylor! Looking forward to the next era!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Truly the most magical night of my entire life!!! I will never get over this night!!
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The most amazing show I’ve seen. My only complaint was my view was obstructed by the light/fire poles (section 405). We couldn’t see Taylor anytime she was in the middle of the stage (when she came out, during anything where she was on the platform). I think those tickets should have been advertised as partially obstructed."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor is an incredible performer and this concert did not disappoint.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I saw Taylor Swift N1 in Vancouver with my biggest kiddo. It was quite literally the best concert I’ve ever been too. The environment was amazing, powerful, beautiful. I’ve never felt more safe, welcome and loved by a crowd of people; all ages, genders, races."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"A one of a kind experience. Unmatched. I've been to some of Taylor's past concerts which were also wonderful. I have also seen many, many other artists perform live. Nothing compares. Taylor and her Eras Tour are quite simply magical. I would see this show over and over again. Her talents as an artist, performer, writer, poet, story teller and producer are exquisite, elegant, relatable, & vulnerable in the best way. Performing for over 3 hours at the level she served up, is mind blowing. Go Tay, go!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was the best concert I have ever attended! From the singing, to the music, to the dancers, and the crew, everything was magical!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift is an absolute power house. She is strong, intelligent, beautiful, and timeless. She transcends. What a privilege it was to see her perform. My daughter and I were fortunate enough to be at the Friday night Vancouver concert where two of her surprise songs were the Never Grow Up/The Best Day medley. We held each other and bawled, and made lifelong memories. Taylor Swift is a gem, a gift, and I will never forget this experience."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift is an amazing human and performer. Grateful to have had the chance to watch her live.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Hands down best performance /concert ever!! ❤️Taylor is so gracious and personable. Can’t wait to see what she does next.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Help I’m still at the restaurant
It was the time of my life fighting dragons with you"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"What an amazing show! I wish I could go back & experience it all again! I have never seen an artist put so much hard work and love into a performance. Endless dance choreo, dazzling costumes and genuine connection with the audience. I have so much respect for swift and her entire crew. I feel so lucky to have been able to experience the end of this era. I can't wait to see what she has in store for us next!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,I was sitting in the side row alone the side of the stage in the first row. Taylor only came out way once she just walked up the main stage. When she did walk our way it was so fast and she didn’t even look at us in the front row for paying as many thousands as I did a little eye contact would be nice I was also at one of the last 3 shows in Vancouver and I thought she would do something special but there wasn’t anything the other shows didn’t have. The nice thing was there was lots of access to water and never a wait for the washroom.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,attending this performance I was a bit worried it wouldn't live up to the sky high expectations but they blew them through the roof! I got to 12 concerts a year and this was the best of my life. 100/10/
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,No one does it like Taylor Swift!! She is the absolute best at what she does! Entertaining down to the last second!!
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Eras Tour is has been one of the most beautiful concerts I have been to. 
Dancers, Taylor singing all the songs that have been with me for years 
I just love the Eras tours"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,The Eras Tour was hands down the best concert that I ever went to. Taylor takes you through each era of her music and even if you are seeing her for the first time or have seen her for multiple times it feels as if you have been apart of her musical journey since the beginning. Her tour production is out of this world and her vocals sound amazing live! Truly an incredible night that I did not want to end. If ever given the chance to see her perform live I fully recommend buying a ticket. I’m already looking forward to the next time she goes on tour.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I don't even know where to begin! This was the most phenomenal concert experience of my life. 
From the second Taylor stepped on stage until the final bows, the entire crowd was absolutely captivated.
Every single detail was perfect. The theatrics were mind-blowing, the costumes were stunning, and the way the setlist flowed through all her musical eras was genius. The light show and pyrotechnics were out of this world, and the wristbands that lit up and synced with the music created the most magical atmosphere.
Taylor's energy was infectious! She poured her heart and soul into every song for 3.5 hours straight. It was an emotional rollercoaster, filled with joy, nostalgia, and pure magic. This is a night I will cherish forever.
If you ever get the chance to see Taylor Swift live, DO IT! You won't regret it."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was the best concert, she’s so talented and the atmosphere in the stadium was unreal."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift puts on an amazing concert. FIVE STARS for the concert itself. 2 STARS for the VIP tickets.  I thought the VIP tickets that we bought for a big upcharge did not include half the things it said it would. There was no VIP entrance, No dedicated merchandise section, the seats we had were not cushioned and actually had an obstructed view. There was a camera tower that blocked the center of the stage. I think I would have been just as happy paying $200 for regular seats.  All we got was a tote bag, some posters and postcards. We got a VIP badge that did nothing for us as well. I felt taken advantage of.  The seats did not correlate to what was portrayed when we bought the tickets. The concert itself was absolutely amazing 🤩"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swiftvwad amazing. Worth every penny! BC Stadium is by far he WORST venue I have seen a show at. All the concrete surfaces create terrible reverb/echos with the treble/high end.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"While the concert was amazing, the events leading up to it were not. I, along with friends and family, registered to be selected to purchase TS tickets on Ticketmaster back in August 2023. There were 12 accounts all together, and NOT ONE OF US, got access to the sale. I was able to buy tickets off of my cousin TWO DAYS before the concert. She managed to get tickets on a drop TM did after the stage was set up. It was very sad to see so many tickets go to resellers for profit. I tried for 16 months to get face value tickets!!!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The Eras tour absolutely did rise up to all the hype! From Taylor herself, to the dancers, the set, the choreography it was a masterclass second to none show!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"We had a phenomenal time at the night 1 Taylor Swift concert in Vancouver. The energy in the city was incredible from the moment we arrived. The venue was great from staff to set up. Event staff were happy, warm and friendly. They brought in a lot of (clean!) port-o-Johns so the lines were never crazy. 
The concert was spectacular. Everything about her show is meticulously planned and Taylor is clearly in a league of her own. Her dancers, band and backup singers are also just fabulous. The crowd was so amped and loud, but she sounded clear and great. I would go again and again…. I hope I get another opportunity to see her."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"After taking a few days to reflect; I have come to the conclusion that Taylor Swift is a true visionary, and a pioneer, a beacon for girls and women world wide. Having attend her Eras Tour, not once, but twice, I think should speak for itself. I have never once been in a single place where nearly 65000 people- not just women/girls, were so unapologetic about their happiness and were loud in expressing it. I am so thankful for Taylor creating these safe spaces for everyone to get together, dance, since, and love together. So many memories created. Eras tour, you were so impactful for over 10.1 million people who have had the pleasure and immense luck in attending you. Cannot wait to see what Taylor decides to do next."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"One of the greatest concerts i have seen and the greatest moment for my 9 year old.

However Ticketmaster needs to get their systems in order. Multiple times saying i am next in queue for tickets only to have it say sold out."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"She’s connected to the crowd. Has a lively spirit time flies in the show. The dances, the stage is all intricately planned out. Truly a show that will live on forever."
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best event and experience ever. The bag policy could have been better about listing no lululemon bags, however I still had a wonderful time!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Wow.  Literally all that needs to be said.  Wow.  Will definitely go see her again.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,this was my actual best day of my life!!  10000000% recommend
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a show, absolutely incredible. I night that I will never forget! She put her all into that show!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift put her whole heart into this tour. A 3 hour long setlist and over 15 outfit changes per show. She takes the time to connect with fans and every show is special and different in their own ways thanks to the surprise songs. Everyone needs to see her live at least once and experience it for themselves.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,This was an amazing lifetime experience yo share with my daughter. Thank you
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Concerts are forever ruined because nothing will top this. It was rare, I was there!"

12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"the best night of my life and life will never get better than dec 6, 2024"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Have to say this was the best ever concert experience I have had a chance to be a part of. Great for younger children as well. I brought my 7 year old and he had a blast singing and dancing to the songs he was familiar with. Would definitely go again if given the opportunity.
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor is an absolute queen!!! 
It was the best show I've ever seen nothing could top it!!!"
12/9/24,BC Place - Vancouver,It was like witnessing history. Honestly.  I took my 11 year old daughter and it was incredible.
3/3/25,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"NOLA N2 was literally the best night of my life. Taylor sounded absolutely amazing, and having Sabrina as a special guest made the show even more incredible! The Eras Tour was incredible!!!!!"
12/12/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Beautiful stage and costumes. Gracie Abrams was killer. Over 3 hours of Taylor including TPPD! Overwhelming!
11/25/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I have seen almost every Eras Tour livestream and this was still worth every penny.  Taylor and her team put on an amazing show that would entertain even the smallest fan.  The show was such an experience that the time flew by.  She knows how to please her fans.  Can't wait for the next tour.
11/22/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Attending Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour was nothing short of magical! From start to finish, the entire experience was perfectly orchestrated. Ticketmaster made the process seamless, and the anticipation leading up to the event only added to the excitement.

Taylor’s performance was absolutely phenomenal. Her stage presence, vocals, and the stunning visuals made every moment unforgettable. Each era came to life with its own unique charm, taking us on a nostalgic journey through her musical evolution. The energy in the crowd was electric, and you could feel the love and connection Taylor shares with her fans.

The venue was well-organized, with clear signage and helpful staff. Entry was smooth, and the sound quality was impeccable throughout the night. I especially appreciated how Ticketmaster kept us updated on event details leading up to the show, which made planning so much easier.

This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m so grateful to Ticketmaster for helping make it happen. Thank you for bringing us closer to an artist who means so much to so many. I’ll cherish this night forever!"
11/16/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was the most fun I’ve had at a concert, ever! Swifties are the kindest, most inclusive , body celebrating group I’ve ever been a part of. The experience is only topped by the amazing talent and theatrics of Taylor and her crew. I will forever be a fan and will do my best to never miss a show tour, even if it means traveling out of town."
11/13/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The show was spectacular! I don't know if any concert will ever beat this. I am still in shock that I was able to see the Eras tour in person.
11/12/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"An amazing experience! Eras lived up to the hype! Taylor was fantastic, on stage for +3 hours and was incredibly engaging. The Swifties were out in force, such a great community; the SuperDome was filled with love and support."
11/10/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Best show I’ve ever seen. Loved all the sets and dancers. Loved going through the eras. Light up bracelet was also really fun.
11/8/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor was a bucket list performer for my daughter and I. Girl got some pipes on her! Not once did she show signs of tiring as my daughter and I sang our hearts out! I've never felt nor experienced so much positive energy in one place in my life! Words could NEVER describe Taylor other than it was a magical experience that you HAVE to be there for! We were there, it was rare, I will remember it for the rest of my life! ❤️ Be prepared for withdraws! Lol"
11/7/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,As a mom my heart will cherish this night for the rest of my life.   It was pure love.   The excitement and joy resonating from every person in that arena added to the insane brilliance of the show itself.  I wish there were words in the English language to do the evening justice.   So I will settle on being grateful for that 3.5 hours with my daughter.   It will stay with us forever.
11/4/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Ticketmaster sucks but I sat in front of it refreshing the page for 2 hours to get my seats behind the stage for $49
11/4/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This concert was AMAZING!!! I had so much fun seeing Taylor Swift live for the first time. All aspects of the show from the music selection to the visual production were amazing. I would 100% go again.
11/3/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Something I wish I could do every weekend. The energy is electric. My sister and I turned this concert into a sister vacation to Nola and it will likely be one of the best life moments for a very long time.
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Loved this venue, it was so fun to see NOLA so alive and small businesses thriving with the ERAS tour in town...AND THE SHOW was a once in lifetime performance from an artist that makes the crowd feel like they are her best audience. Never a dull moment...every song choreographed leaving everyone entertained for over 3 hours!!"
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Nola N3 was truly the best night of my life! Taylor and Gracie’s performances were incredible and words cannot express how out of this world the night was!! I had obstructed view nosebleed tickets, but there is truly no bad seat in the stadium. I would go again and again a million times!"
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We LOVE Taylor Swift! She delivers every single time! Taylor IS the artist of the XXI Century! Can’t wait to see her in the next tour!
11/2/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Ms Swift is the best performer out there. This isn’t just a concert, it’s a once in a lifetime experience that I am so grateful to have attended. The most amazing choreography, and obviously her setlist is absolutely insane. I loved this show so much <3"
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I still can't believe we got tickets!!! It was a once in a lifetime chance to see a once in a lifetime show. Tickets opened up on Friday night for N2 in NOLA, and we miraculously got regular priced floor seats! We drove 12 hours back and forth in 24 hours to see Taylor put on the most amazing, heartstopping, emotional rollercoaster of a show. I am still riding the high of this experience! It was my first Taylor Swift show, and I can't believe I got to have this experience!!! So so so blessed and thankful!"
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that left me absolutely speechless! From the very first note to the final encore, Taylor Swift brought every era of her music to life in a way that was both nostalgic and electrifying. The production value was insane—stunning visuals, flawless choreography, and a seamless flow from one era to the next that felt like a journey through time. Taylor’s voice sounded incredible live, and you could feel her passion with every lyric.

What made it even more magical was the crowd energy—thousands of fans singing every word and waving lights synchronized to the music. It was like being part of a massive celebration, with each song bringing back memories and hitting all the feels. The Eras Tour isn’t just a concert; it’s an emotional rollercoaster and a testament to how much her music means to so many people. Truly unforgettable! If you’re a Swiftie or just love live music, this tour is everything you could hope for and more."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It was me & my 8-yo daughter’s 1st time to see Taylor, 1st time to travel w/on my husband & her very 1st concert attendancd. Taylor’s performance was the absolute best - no dull moment even in between Eras & costume changes. She truly brought the house down. I will never forget the experience & I’m sure my daughter won’t either! Thank you Taylor for giving your fans an experience of a lifetime."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We had a great time.  Venue was easy to navigate.  Seats were great.  Taylor never disappoints
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"While I haven't been a certified Swiftie for very long, The Eras Tour has been on my bucket list since she announced it 2 years ago. Taylor did not disappoint with this show and neither did the venue. We saw her in NOLA (which made for an amazing trip on its own) and the Superdome was great. The crowd was electric and we even got a surprise guest on night 2. I danced, cried, and screamed the lyrics to my favorite songs along with 65,000 other Swifties. 
I just wish Ticketmaster didn't have such a monopoly on live events and allow scalpers to get tickets instead of fans."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Wow. and I mean wow. This was my first concert ever, and I had such a blast at the Eras Tour. I am so grateful to have seen Taylor. She has been my idol since I was little, and seeing her in person versus on a grainy livestream? It is a major difference. The energy in the audience was unreal, and just the environment made me feel so safe. Seeing everyone in harmony loving something as much as me made me feel like we were all a family. The synchronized light up bracelets were such a good add on so that Taylor could see each and every one of us. I absolutely will forever treasure being a part of this amazing journey of Taylor's, as this truly was a core memory in my heart."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Everything about the Eras tour was spectacular!! Taylor Swift is so talented. Her sets are amazing and the fans are the best!!
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"For its length and well reported profitability, I am disappointed that consideration and improvements weren’t made to the stage set-up so that people seated on the ends / sides of the stage couldn’t see the main backdrop behind the performers. When viewed from the front of the stage the show is much more dynamic. I don’t feel like my kids or I got the full experience and I paid an exorbitant amount for what looked like good seats online. My kids had fun, but, as a consumer I was disappointed.  That said, I appreciated the positive atmosphere and demeanor of the staff at the Superdome."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The NOLA Superdome was a spacious and inviting venue.  Walking distance to several bars and restaurants (though not many were still open when the show closed).  Venue served food, water, and alcohol.  Restrooms were neat and tidy.  Venue attendants and vendors were all cheerful and pleasant.  Will return to the Superdome for future events."
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The best concert I have ever been too. New Orleans put the red carpet out for visitors going to the show.
11/1/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Made memories at this concert that I will NEVET forget! The venue was surprisingly organized, full of nice people and halfway affordable (except the alcoholic drinks!) 

Taylor is an absolutely phenomenal performer that doesn't let a snag ruin her show. We love her ❤️"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The lights, Taylor's vocals, the dancers and band. Even down to the wrist bands, this was such an amazing concert. I even hyped it up in my mind and it still didn't compare. There's nothing like it. I cried and sang along with my friends. Screamed bridges and applauded our hearts out. Lost my voice. I wish I could go again. I don't feel my words do it justice. Thank you, Taylor!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This was an amazing night and an incredible experience. Wish I could do it all over again. The Eras Tour was a night I’ll never forget. 10/10.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The whole experience was so smooth and effortless. There wasn't a single thing that didn't go by smoothly and it was very clear that a lot of thought and planning went into making sure that everything an easy process for the fans and I am so thankful for that. The opener was amazing and surpassed all of my expectations and I will be tuning into her music from now on! Gracie truly did a AMAZING job and I'm so grateful to have experienced her contagious energy that perfectly prepared the crowd for what was to come. Taylor was a force to be reckoned with. She was BORN to be a performer and it's so clear in person. Her attention to detail in each set is absolutely unmatched, from the AMAZING live band to the lights illuminating the crowd, costumes, props, choreography etc. The dancers seem to respect her so much and always seem like they are having the time of their lives. You can tell she has so much love and pride for what she does because it shines through so heavily in all of her ventures, ESPECIALLY this one. She was glowing the whole night and gave us THE unforgettable experience of a lifetime. Words cannot describe how amazing this concert was and I will cherish it forever and always!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,By far the best experience at a concert. Concert started early which I can appreciate. It was amazing!
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Great concert.  Would definitely go/watch again.  Wish Ticketmaster would offer Meet/Greet for T.S.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We enjoyed the concert so much! And we appreciated how easy it was to get in :)
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor Swift is an INSANE performer! She put on the most spectacular show for over 3 hours! No one is doing it like her and she is a once in a life time artist! Already looking forward to her next tour! The Eras Tour is by far the most amazing tour I have ever attended. Fantastic show, backup dancers singers to the lights and backgrounds!!!!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swifts concert is life changing. Its a cathartic experience. It's beautiful! Me and my mom screamed along and cried during her surprise song clean. Seeing so much joy on my moms face and seeing her happy was 1000% worth it. I'll never forget how we felt.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"10/10 experience 🫶🏻✨ wish i could go back! Everything was perfect and the show was completely amazing! Completely blown away by her performance, the dancers, the band, the backup vocalist everything was spectacular! 🫶🏻✨🦋"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Experiencing this concert was the highlight of my year!!  Getting to take my granddaughter was priceless!  Watching the excitement on her face from telling her I scored tickets, to getting dressed, to seeing the stage for the first time, to Taylor coming out on stage was truly magical and an experience we will forever and always remember!!!  This was by far the best concert experience I have ever attended and wish I could have done more!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I thought Taylor Swift put on a great show.  It was very entertaining and well choreographed.  My two girl's absolutely loved it.

10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Wow, this was the most incredible night of my life, from watching Gracie Abrams performing and crying and watching her sing Risk because it was just so special. Then Taylor came on. It is one of the best experiences ever to see someone I have loved since I was six.  I don't just love her music; I look up to her as a woman, and seeing her up there inspired me so much to work hard and chase my dreams. Long live all the magic we made. I remember it all too well."
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The concert event was well setup for the amount of people there. The town was prepared and very efficient to keep everyone fed and housed. It was the biggest production I have ever seen and would recommend anyone to see her show. My family had a great time youth and adults. Police were everywhere and homeland security so I felt very safe. The streets were closed for walking traffic to and from the event also which was massive for me to see.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I loved everything about the show and the venue. Not only did the venue welcome the Taylor swift fans and Taylor swift herself but everyone was just so nice. The show itself was amazing and there was not one person who wasn’t dancing in the 60,000 plus seated stadium even those who accompanied someone. Thanks so much for a night WE will never forget."
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This concert was nothing short of amazing! My daughter & I had an great time, as did some friends of ours. Taylor Swift has this superpower to make a show more than just a show, it is a full on experience & her audience loves it. I heard so many times, “I wasn’t a Swiftie before, but I am now.” She keeps the crowd engaged from beginning to end for over 3 hours."
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It was the best experience ever, especially for my first concert. Definitely set high expectations. Gracie Abrams, Taylor Swift, AND Sabrina Carpenter. Was I dreaming???"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The Eras Tour is pure fun! I took my 12 yo daughter and we had seen the film and plenty of social media videos to know what we were going to witness. Bit to see it in person and to feel the excitement of the entire crowd is an unbelievable experience.
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Seeing the ERAS Tour, NOLA was a once in a lifetime experience with 3 of my adult children and 2 grandkids. Amazing!!!"
10/31/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"There is nothing to even compare this to…I have seen a lot of concerts and this show was an experience. The energy and excitement leading up to and during the show just made everything even better!  Every set was unique, beautiful and magical."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"this was my 1st concert ever and I've been a huge swiftie since 2021, the eras tour was so worth it oh my!!! I can't wait for her next tour, this was a core memory

anyone else nola n3?"

10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It was magical—one of my top five experiences! Taylor's live performance was even better than I expected.

It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well!!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Great performance! Excellent show. Terrific idea on changing the men’s restroom to women’s. We needed that!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This show was so much more than I could have ever expected.  My daughter is one of the biggest Taylor swift fans and when she came out my girl screamed with excitement than started to cry.  We had the most amazing night and one we will never ever forget!  Thank you Taylor for all you do in showing ours kids how to be a strong independent woman that can conquer the world!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"There is a reason these tickets are so coveted, and after all the hype of having bought them from the pre-sale, the concert itself was so worth it. Absolutely breathtaking, an experience unlike any other. The tremendous effort put in by Taylor, Gracie, the bands, the dancers, the stage crew, the designers, and everyone is plainly evident. Each moment was curated perfection, we all felt a part of something much bigger than us from the very atmosphere in the dome. If you are able to get tickets, consider it an honor! Prepare for one of the most unforgettable nights of your life."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The concert was AMAZING!  Taylor’s concerts live up to the hype and I would absolutely would go again!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Best concert ever.  Everyone at the venue was nice, there were events all over the city that weekend, and the show was amazing!! Taylor never disappoints!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Unbelievable the stamina, voice and connection with her fans. Saw people from 5 years old to 75. I wish our country could get together like 65,000 concert goers can"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Awesome experience!  It was organized and efficient getting into the venue, the seats were great, Gracie Abrams was an awesome starting act, Taylor Swift and her crew were absolutely incredible, the vibe of the concertgoers was electric and it was organized and efficient leaving the venue as well.  Incredible experience all the way around! The Eras Tour is a must see!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Absolutely phenomenal concert! Taylor Swift sure nows how to put on a mesmerizing concert.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor gave a phenomenal performance. Her outfits were beautiful and her voice is even more amazing live. There was a stage malfunction and you would have never known as Taylor did not miss a beat. The atmosphere was electric and the vibe was just so good. New Orleans and Taylor combined is my new favorite thing in the world.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was one of the best concerts I've ever been too. It was easy to get in the venue once I had tickets. The concert was amazing i mean of course it was, Taylor Swift is the best."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,OG Swiftie here and NOLA N3 was literally the best experience! We had an amazing time! Taylor makes everyone so happy and spreads so much joy! So glad we were able to attend!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor was amazing! It was a memory making experience. Everything about it was incredible. I only hope to be so lucky to see her perform again one day.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swift did an outstanding job in her concert. She was so entertaining and kept the crowd on their feet. There is not a price to put on a ticket for her. There are not many people that can sing and perform for over 3 hours! She is a legend and full of class. I met a ton of lovely people over New Orlean’s Taylor weekend. It was a great time for making memories with my girls!🫶
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Best concert I’ve been to BY FAR!!!! This was the best night of my life! I’ve been a fan of Taylor’s since I was 12 and to finally see her in concert at 29 years old has been such a blessing!! Hoping for many more!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I’m not a big TS fan, but I took my daughter to both the RED and ERAS (NOLA N3) tours. TS is a consummate professional, a hardworking performer, and brings her best to her Swifties every time. Her show is truly a delightful multi sensory experience, and her fans are the kindest community of people."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Granted, I was a little upset that I was waitlisted for the presale. I can say that I’m forever thankful to my brother who was able to buy tickets off of someone else! The entire day was incredible, the energy is something I fear will never be matched again! Taylor herself, while she may not have seen me or my friends, made us feel so incredibly joyful and happy the entire night!! Thank you to Taylor for all that you do and all that you’ve done for me personally!!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour in New Orleans was the best concert ever. Ceasers Superdome was beautiful and clean, staff was friendly and  supportive. We will absolutely visit again!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The best concert I've ever been to in my entire life. I do not think I can put into words how incredible this night was -- I only wish I was able to go again!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,this was my 3rd eras tour date to see and would be lying if I said it wasn’t better every time. You can be way back in obstructed view or up front it’s amazing either way!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,One of the best concerts ever.  Taylor is an absolute legend and a genius when it comes to performing and engaging the crowd.  Can’t wait to see her again!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was the greatest time of my life. This was definitely worth spending so much (I do wish they weren’t up to 1,000 for a ticket). This was definitely a once and a life time to see this experience and hope people get a chance to see Taylor perform."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Seeing Taylor Swift perform is food for the soul. The entire experience was top-notch, from the pre-sale ticket purchase to exiting the Super Dome in NOLA. Ms. Swift's joy is genuine and she freely shares with all those around her. Concert-goers are treated to more than just a concert. They embark on a journey for all the senses. Thank you Taylor for bringing people together, and for sharing your unbelievable talent with us. We needed that. #13forever. Never stop being YOU."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"SHE WAS SO AMAZING!!! Everything was so thought out and you can just see how much work was put into it! I just don’t know how she performs for so long! 13/13, would ABSOLUTELY see her again."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor puts on the best show. Amazing and magical night surrounded by the community that she has cultivated over the years. The absolute best night of my life.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor is hands down the best performer I have ever seen live. It’s not just the length of the show but the effort, energy, and talent she puts into it. Every detail is meticulously thought out to give the audience the best experience regardless of where they are sitting. Truly an unbelievable show and I’m so thankful for the experience and memories"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I’ve been fortunate to attend two Eras tour concerts, Seattle and New Orleans. And I can say that both shows were phenomenal!! The energy the shows have is  contagious. I truly believe The Eras Tour is a lesson on leadership. Not only can Taylor Swift  engage and entertain her fans to the point where you feel connected with her and valued as a fan. But everyone on stage is also so connected and engaged with the audience that you can truly tell they love their job. For a tour to be this successful and be able to put on >100 shows over a two year time period, is a clear indication that Taylor Swift is not only the Queen of Pop music, but also identifies her leadership skills in building trust and loyalty in those she employs. It is evident from Taylor Swift’s career, that she holds herself to a high standard. She knows herself and her values and has never strayed from who she is. But it is also most apparent that those she employs also take on her high standards, as every show of the Eras Tour was performed to a level of excellence giving Swiftie’s only the best performance possible and nothing less. For such a major company that Taylor Swift owns to all be so connected and model such excellence, shows her leadership style. Extremely well done Taylor Swift! Watching you perform was truly spectacular. I think all C-level leaders could learn a thing or two from you on business management and how to build trust and loyalty with those you support."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I am so thankful I got to experience the eras tour. It was a once in a lifetime experience for me and I will remember it forever. Taylor Swift and her performers and musicians are on a whole different level from anyone I’ve ever experienced perform live. They are amazing.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swift puts on a fantastic show! Merch lines were quick and effective. Self serve concessions with self check out is very cool and helpful
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This show was everything you dreamed of and more. Out of this world experience that I wish every swiftie could experience. Taylor leaves her heart on the stage at every show and it’s such a shared experience with so many fans. I attended by myself, but never felt alone. Between the shared experiences and trading friendship bracelets, it definitely felt like a fandom and I feel so proud to be a part of."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Incredible life changing insane experience I wish Ticketmaster would let us give 13 stars
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor and crew put on an amazing show. Was a little disappointed in the lack of food options at the Caeserdome and that all the smalls in merchandise sold out after waiting in VERY LONG lines, but the concert itself was the best we have ever seen."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The concert was amazing. This was my second time going to the eras tour because of her performance. I wish I didn’t have to end!!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I am nearly 60, and have been to dozens of concerts in my lifetime.  My Taylor Swift concert attendance in New Orleans on Night 3 is without question the best concert experience in my life.  Taylor, her dancers, the band, the stage, the wristbands, the venue, and so much more made for an incredibly immersive experience like none other.  The attendants and Swifties alike were incredibly friendly.  Taylor herself was in top form and exceeded in every way possible from her powerful voice, boundless energy, stamina, and charisma.  I have never had a concert experience so memorable and never forget the memories from this incredible evening."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Seats were great!.. not too high or low so you got an up close view but also experienced the whole show lights, theatrics, and all"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Simply amazing. Not a bad seat anywhere. What a complete showman. Would 100% watch again.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor delivered!!!! She and her dancers/singers had such great energy until the very end. I would go a thousand more times! Only thing was it was very crowded and barely had room to dance but other than that it was amazing!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This concert unreal and I am so thankful that I was able to be apart of it 😭😭 I pray she goes on tour again and I’m able to buy them at presale
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,It was an amazing concert. Taylor Swift puts on such an entertaining show.  I would recommend it to everyone.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"One of the best experiences of my life, worth every penny. I went w my 31-year-old daughter and my 18-year-old niece, we sang and danced and had the time of our lives. The positive energy and vibes at a Taylor Swift show are indescribable. You can't put into words what it's like to attend the Era's Tour, it's something you have to experience, it's a feeling. Wish I could afford to see her again."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I wish The Eras Tour would go on forever! The vibes and energy are unlike any other concert I’ve ever been to!!! 10/10 always recommend!!!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I thought it would have been more of an awe-inspiring show with more lights and imagery. Really was just her singing and repeating the same small-talk she did for every other show. No breaks available and the seating very tight with only one way to get out but with everyone standing and recording, you didn’t want to bother anyone by trying to exit. Also, very long bathroom lines."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"No words will ever truly give an accurate depiction of what this show really is. Taylor’s pure athleticism is admirable. Her teams (dancers, vocalists, band, etc) took it to all new levels!! I went for Taylor because her music has been there for me since the beginning. But I also went alone for healing after the most painful break up of my life only a few months prior. And I got everything I went for and more! I’ll forever be grateful for what Taylor does for those of us that love her and her gift of music. Thank you doesn’t even come close!!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Went to NOLA N1 and N3. Stadium was incredible! Absolutely recommend going to an indoor stadium with a roof for the full Era’s experience. Saw Era’s twice at Wembley Stadium and the sun was still out. Taylor performed her heart out flawlessly every night and the crowds were just as great! NOLA Swifties: thanks for sharing the experience, the bracelets and the love!!! Ticketmaster exchange was incredibly easy as well and stadium staff was kind and helpful. Searching for Canada tickets now! Love, peace and happiness to my fellow Swifties!!! Hope to see everyone at the next one!!!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"There are so many reasons why Taylor Swift is as big as she is, and her concerts are definitely one of them. She KNOWS how to put on a show. This is my second time seeing her on the Eras Tour, but it was just as magical as the first. This time I had 3rd row floor seats that I paid a little over $500 for, it may seem like a lot but I am telling you it was SO worth it. Taylor came over to our section multiples times and interacted with us. Her dancers also were so fun and interactive as well, I got loads of great videos of them waving and dancing at my camera. 10/10 would recommend!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Had the best experience with my daughter at The Eras tour! Definitely the show of the century!! And New Orleans was the most welcoming city for all the swifties!!!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I had such an amazing time at the Eras tour, I hadn’t expected to be able to go, but the last minute ticket drops helped my dream come true. I did have to be relocated to the ADA seating area because I couldn’t climb the stairs to my original seat, but the new seat was amazing and gave me such a wonderful view of Taylor and the dancers. If I could do it all over again, I would. This was the concert of a lifetime and a truly magical experience."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I have been to a lot of concerts (big and small) and this has been by far the best experience I’ve ever had. It was a well oiled machine. The production was incredible. She really catered to and loves her fans and I am ready to it all over again.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was truly a magical experience and while I spent way too much on resale tickets it was worth it overall, to me. I felt like a child seeing the Disney world fireworks show for the first time. Taylor is the most amazing artist and you can tell the hard work that is put into the show by all of the performers and musicians!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Loved every second of the show, from songs to costume changes to the dancers and the stage opening up and rising. Super cool!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Thank you, Taylor so a night I will never forget! 3 1/2 hours up there leaning it on the stage for us! So glad I got to see it!!!!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,We surprised our 10 year old with tickets at Christmas to see her favorite singer.  This was by far the best show I’ve ever been too and was the perfect choice for our daughter’s first show!  Everything was beyond words!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Great show from Taylor that lived up to expectations. Was at NOLA N3 and was disappointed there was no special guest (Sabrina Carpenter N2). However the VENUE WAS HORRIBLE. Had an overhang in section 104 and could not see the entire venue. But the worst was the moving floor! It was not concrete but a composite decking that was warped and I COULD NOT STAND LEVEL at any time. I was being bounced around and had to hang on at certain points. Not kidding or exaggerating. I went to Guest Services and many others had complained so I was not alone. I ended up standing in the back by the section entrance and really couldn’t see well. REALLY DISAPPOINTED. It is an understatement that the whole composite floor bounce thing greatly took away from my overall experience.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I’ve been able to see Taylor twice and each time is better! Cannot wait to get to see her again and take my daughter next time!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I will never be happier than I was at this concert. It was the most magical experience of my life and I would give anything to do it again.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Such a fun experience she’s absolutely amazing she gives you a 1000% from start to finish the bracelet exchange even going on the plane to get there before the concert you get the experience it was so much fun 🤩 my daughter and I had a blast everyone’s so friendly glitter everywhere just so much fun!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This is the best show I have been to in my 54 years. I have seen some legends! This by far exceeded my expectations! She gives 1000% for the full 3+ hours! 🩷💜🩷🩷
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Not enough words to describe, Taylor knows how to put on a show and I’m grateful I got to take my girls to see her last night in NOLA! Zero regrets, 10/10, would do it again and again!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It’s hard to describe the feeling being in Taylor’s world. It was truly the way the world should be. People were not merely NICE, there was an overwhelming aura of pure love. I have never received so many hugs and kisses from people I didn’t know!  Then the Tour itself - I can’t even call it a concert because there is no word for what Taylor did. It was an amazing artistic  performance with each era bringing a different vibe and unique experience. Every movement, expression, word, costume, and set had a specific purpose. At 63, I have been to countless concerts in my life, but nothing has nor will ever compare to The Eras Tour! I am so proud of my wonderful city of New Orleans for being ALL IN for Taylor Swift. Even the police were trading friendship bracelets! Sharing it with my sister, godchild, and great niece made it mean even more!  Truly this entire experience is a core memory in my life. As Taylor would say, “Most fun I ever had, and I'd do it over and over and over again if I could."""
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The show was spectacular! We enjoyed every second of the 3 1/2 hour mega production. So glad we got to see it in. OLA because the city really embraced Swifties.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Such an amazing experience for my family and I. We will never forget the Eras Tour! Ticketmaster was so easy to use and everything went smoothly.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Insane energy, positive environment, refreshing. Electric. I cannot say enough. THANK YOU TAYLOR"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The whole experience was amazing. It was super easy to get to the concert, easy to get in and Taylor put on such an awesome show. Overall, it was the best night ever."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Loved it so much!!! Had the best experience in NOLA! Such a lively experience and I’m so lucky to have been a part of it!! Really hope I get to experience it one more time 🩷
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras tour team handled everything so well. The show they put on was out of this world. Both Taylor Swift and Gracie Abram have incredible voices and song writing skills!

No thanks to Ticketmaster. Their practices are dated and unfair. Their customer service is terrible. They only care about their profits at the end of the day."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,There's a reason this concert is so famous and popular. I'm so glad I was able to experience it live as it is one of the biggest cultural moments of our generation. Taylor is an incredible performer and the Swifties are an incredible fanbase. The city of New Orleans really went all out and we had the best time!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"She really knows how to put on the best show. No matter where you are in the stadium it’s such a good time. There’s no bad seats at this tour. The dancers were amazing, the set list was amazing, the lights and production was AWESOME! I’ll never forget this show."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Amazing time and security did an excellent job of monitoring the floor and getting everyone in and out quickly.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor puts on a show, an experience and core memory that we will have forever. We have the time of our lives fighting dragons with her. The staff and the dancers, the band, the stage crew, the security, it all : everyone was wonderful."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"No matter how many times you attend, watch the movie, watch live streams, nothing substitutes for the live experience of The Eras Tour. Everything from performance, staging and even the crowd are just unmatched for spectacle."
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This concert was honestly one of the greatest concerts I've been to in my life. Gracie Abrams did a great job and Taylor took off with that crowd energy and ran with it! I would definitely go see her again!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor swift was right there in front of my face and I almost passed out. She looked me dead in my eyeballs. I couldn’t have asked for anything more.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was our second time to see Taylor and it only got better! She's an amazing artist and puts on a fantastic, high energy show! And when she brought Sabrina Carpenter out on Saturday night in NOLA my girl was shocked! Thanks again, Taylor, for another magical Eras Tour show!"
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swift in NOLA N2 was amazing! She definitely knows how to put on a good show! I loved every second of it and it was worth every penny I paid.
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Best concert I’ve ever been to! She performed for over 3 hours! Opening act was great! The stadium was organized. Had a wonderful time!
10/30/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This was my wife and my honeymoon and we couldn’t have asked for a better start to it with Taylor Swift. She did such and amazing job performing and even brought Sabrina Carpenter on.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I had the best time!!! It was an amazing show!! And my tickets through Ticketmaster went so smoothly!!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor is an amazing woman. She loves her fans and somehow manages to keep her success in perspective - heights are fragile! She is in the stratosphere, but she continues to bring her music and her talent down to her base, to her fans, in the most energetic performance I have ever seen."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Once in a lifetime show…nothing can ever compare to Taylor Swift. Spectacular perfection from a beautiful superstar!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Incredible experience, an amazing show and unforgettable! The venue staff handled the 65,000 crowd of swifties with professionalism and ease making the experience even more enjoyable."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I was fortunate enough to see three Eras concerts.  They were simply amazing and an experience I will never forget.  I hope she does a TTPD tour!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor’s concert is amazing!  A real must see!  I just wish I could have seen it, but the girls in front of us refused to sit in their seats, so I didn’t get to see much of it!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Best concert ever! Swifties are another level and I love it! I had the best night. Taylor is and ICON!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I saw the Reputation Stadium Tour in Cleveland a few years ago, I thought the performance couldn’t be topped. I was so wrong, this was in fact the greatest night of my life. Just seeing Taylor Swift alone is amazing, but Gracie Abram’s AND Sabrina Carpenter!! It was crazy in the best way possible. I highly recommend to everyone I know to see Taylor Swift at least once in their lifetime because it is a life changing experience. I love Taylor Swift and her music, and this concert alone made me love her even more which I didn’t know what even possible. The superdome was great, a long with the crowd. I won’t lie, I cried as soon as Taylor came on stage as well as when Sabrina came out. This was the most surreal night I’ve lived thus far in my life. I hope that Taylor goes on more tours so I can meet her possibly one day. I know a lot of people to claim to be her biggest fan, but truly her music has helped with so much in my life. I’m forever grateful for what an amazing human she is, and what concert she puts on. Overall this was an ♾️/10 experience!!!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Worth every single penny to experience the pure, unadulterated, joy that filled the Superdome on night two of the Eras Tour. Loved every second of it ❤️"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Scored fantastic tickets for NOLA, got a great hotel, dressed the part and had the time of our lives!!!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"We made the friendship bracelets, took the moment and taste it. We had no reason to be afraid. We were not on our own kid, we were surrounded by the most positive energy in the world."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,So excited to have gotten tickets a few days before concert on ticket drop!! Thanks so much for the experience !! Will always use Ticketmaster!!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"First of all, Gracie Abrams was excellent her performance was absolutely phenomenal. Enjoyed her as an opener for Taylor Swift. 
Taylor Swift was amazing, I’ve been to concerts, and though they were amazing the eras tour was on another level. Beyond magical. From the fans to the employees everything was wonderful."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,unbelievably awesome.  the vibe.  the music. Taylor is a world class talent and classy act.  from starting on time to giving three and a half hours of herself to the production and band and dancers.   just worth every penny.   and I have been to many concert events!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Superdome did amazing!!!!! Everything was very organized and perfect. AND OF COURSE TAYLOR WAS AMAZING PLEASE BEG HER TO COME BACK!!!!!!!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This is a must see show for everyone. Taylor puts on the best show every minute, from start to finish with incredible fine details."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Had a great night at Taylor Swifts Eras! It was so nice to have an event that the whole family could enjoy. It is not often lately that there are places where you feel comfortable letting your kids talk and interact with so many people on their own. Everyone there was so pleasant and excited for the night. I believe this says a lot about her as a person and performer, the fan base she has developed feels like family. Not to mention she performed for over three hours and seemed just as happy to be there as the people there to see her. Great concert, would go again if only there were more shows!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour in NOLA, night 2 was beyond amazing! A present to my recently turned 13 daughter, it checked all the boxes & then some. The level of talent & production is unmatched. I have never attended a more entertaining concert. So many memories & such a welcoming city & venue."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,i went to nola n2 on the eras tour and it was the best night of my life and im going to try and get tickets to taylor’s last show on here since everywhere else is over priced like crazy im hoping it won’t be that hard so that i can get four tickets so i can give away two tickets
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The outside security seemed pretty lax, but inside was much more strict and tightly run. The actual Taylor Swift show itself was absolutely amazing and breathtaking! The sound, lighting, everything was flawless and Taylor Swift is an iconic and powerful woman. So grateful to be a part of The Eras Tour!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor was amazing as usual and the Superdome/NOLA was fantastic too. No issues, just a great time."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,what else can I say? Taylor is the best. She has the best band. She has the best dancers. She has the best production.

10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,What can I say - she is the greatest performer of all time. Loved The Eras Tour!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,AMAZING. The music. The dancing. The lights. The stage. The production. The performing. The crowd. everything was AMAZING.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The BEST concert I’ve ever been to. Taylor Swift is an amazing performer. Entry to the concert was a breeze with no issues. I had my ticket preloaded to my Apple wallet.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I don’t have words to express how amazing this concert and entire weekend was. I’m never going to get over this experience. Money comes and goes, memories last forever."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Tickets are so easy to access and have never had a problem locating/using them
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The ERAS Tour is hands down the best concert I have ever been to. Taylor Swift and her musicians and dancers are some of the most dedicated and talented people in the business. If you can get a ticket to this show run, don’t walk to see it. It’s life changing and an amazing experience."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,A true dream come true. I’ll never get over this. And Ticketmaster made it so easy for us. Thank you.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Amazing. A full 3.5 hours of dancing and singing and fun! My only complaint would be the big pillar in front of us that was only on our side. I think it was for sound or something but it blocked us from seeing the diamond and she was there a lot. We were sec 215
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was the best experience of my life. I’ve gone 4 times so far, every time is different in the best of ways."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Amazing experience. Horrible experience with ticketmaster!!! But amazing show. TS
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This concert changed my life forever! I cannot even put into words how amazing Taylor Swift was! The whole experience was amazing! Also the venue was spectacular. A large reason why the concert was so amazing, it was because of the venue. They did such an excellent job accommodating all of the swifties  that came in for her three night run in New Orleans! Cesar Superdome, I will be back soon!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I am not a Swiftie prese! I simply admire that young woman and all of the good she does for the communities she plays and how she takes care of her crew. Mothers and daughters singing every single word of every song. It was something t witness.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"As you all know, getting Taylor Swift tickets is no easy feat. I finally got seats in section 111 row 36, which showed as the middle of the section on the seating map. However, when I got to the show, my row was the last row. It wasn’t even in the section, they were fold our chairs behind the section in the concourse. With this, the section above us’ awning was in our view line, where we had to duck to see the jumbo screen. Obstructed view was never listed, and like I already mentioned, the row was shown was middle of the section, definitely not the last row and not in the food concourse. It was loud, due to people going to the bathroom and getting food, and the lights were always on, so my view of the stage was also backlit and awkward. I’m so disappointed."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"N2 of the eras tour in New Orleans was absolutely magical! From beginning to end. From Gracie Abrams to the surprise of Sabrina Carpenter there was not a moment when excitement wasn't at peak. I have never experienced so much friendship, love, and joy in one place in my entire life. Taylor Swift is the most amazing performer ever!!!! Like ever!!!!! I cannot put into words all of the emotions we went through in those 3 and a half hours. It truly was sparkling night. It was rare and I was there! Thank you Taylor Swift for emblazing  into my heart a night never to be forgotten. And never to be outdone."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This is a must see concert.  It was nonstop fun and entertainment.  She sang for over 3 hours straight with maybe a minute break for outfit changes. Would easily go see her again & again.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The concert was amazing! I wish the Ticketmaster process had been easier, but the actual concert was a dream come true!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Took my daughter that’s the fan. Taylor puts on a fantastic show that goes all out. I’ve been to U2, Roger waters but this was the largest production of a concert I’ve seen. Very impressive."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"10/10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 
If you ever have the opportunity to see Taylor Swift perform live, you shouldn’t miss it!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The concert was such an amazing experience, it really is a special tour. Everyone I met at the concert was so sweet and kind and just full of positive vibes!

There is nothing quite like a stadium full of people singing along to every word.

My only complaint is the floor seats I was in kept moving. They weren’t secured to the floor, so the rows kept sliding back."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I’ve been a die hard swiftie since debut came out as a preteen. It was absolutely magical to watch her with my daughter. Beyond the most bonding experience & im forever grateful that we had that opportunity. WE LOVE YOU TAYLOR!!!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The concert was great and I loved how many strong and beautiful women and little girls attended the performance.  They all seemed so happy and excited.  Taylor Swift's performance was an enjoyable event that should be shared with friends, families and even strangers.  She performed for 3 hours straight and everyone was dancing and singing."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The concert was absolutely amazing.  I bought tickets to take my nephew.  I didn't consider myself a Swiftie but liked some of her songs.  I was blown away by the entire production and Taylor Swift.  We were fortunate to have Gracie Abrams as an opener.  Then during the surprise song, Taylor pulled Sabrina Carpenter on stage.  Everyone went wild.  I have to say Swifties are the kindest people.  The entire concert weekend was a blast!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I've been a fan of Taylor since her debut in 2006. This was my first Taylor concert and I had the time of my life! The entire experience of seeing her live and so up close was amazing! She put on a great show from start to finish, and I loved the surprise songs and appearance from Sabrina Carpenter. I would attend the Eras Tour for a second time if I could, but will definitely attend another album tour."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It was an amazing experience and a super fun time. Tickets were nearly impossible to get as you can imagine but once we did get them, getting into the concert was simple and easy."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This was the most well produced concert I have ever been to--and it was fun--and she was amazing. You need more merch stations I missed the warm up act because the lines for merch were so long I wasn't upset but that would make it even better!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This show is truly worth the hype! So glad I was able to score tickets and see this. It’s very long so plan your bathroom breaks accordingly! Merch lines are crazy long, so plan to get there early."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"It’s no surprise that Taylor swift is truly a mastermind in marketing and performance but the overall experience of being a swiftie in her New Orleans era was above and beyond. New Orleans went all out to not only decorate the superdome in larger than life friendship bracelets but the whole town invested into this weekend of performances- every store front and souvenir shop had something related to Taylor swift - street performers were all playing or singing her music- “welcome swifties” signs adorned almost every hotel and shop. Chain companies created swifty merch just for the weekend. Stores and restaurants had special events for all the fans. Speciality drinks were created at every bar. Street vendors were well prepared. Inside the superdome they had arranged for more women’s bathrooms to be created (which meant less men’s bathrooms) but it was appreciated. The merch lines were ridiculously long but that’s going to happen with three sold out shows. I do wish there had been more merch stations - the concert itself was flawless from beginning to end. You got your money’s worth with all the staging, costumes, wonderful performers, special effects, props, pyrotechnics, audience participation, and I would be remiss not to mention our special guest artist, Sabrina Carpenter! What a surprise! 
I will say that three weeks before going, my Ticketmaster account was hacked into and all my tickets were “transferred” to multiple unauthorized accounts. Ticketmaster did recover all of my tickets and I have since created a new account and will cancel this one since Taylor is finally completed. She puts on an amazing show. I don’t know how she does it, truly. Props to your stamina and your whole team! Thank you for an unforgettable weekend."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,What a once in a lifetime experience seeing Taylor Swift with my daughter and two grand daughters!  Ticketmaster did a great job on securing my tickets up until the date.  Loved the quick reminders to download the tix.  Easy to get into the Super Dome!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I had the best experience and the time of my life at this concert!!! it was the absolute best!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This night was magical. I felt 10 again trading bracelets with new friends. Taylor is a force. Gracie Abrams is bomb.com. Thank you both!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I LOVE Taylor swift and her show is always amazing. I went to Ireland with my in-laws and then I was able to take my niece and daughter. We had the time of our lives and I wish the show never ended. Hope the TTPD set gets put on Disney!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Not that it needs to be said but the concert  was incredible. 3 hours of music and singing and fun, together with the energy and happiness before and after, made it a can't miss event. No wonder it's the tour of our generation."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor Swift was amazing, spectacular, perfect, the best night of my life. Ticketmaster was absolutely AWFUL, 0/5 stars, hated everything about Ticketmaster."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylors shows are MAGICAL!!!  She puts her all into it and it shows.  I can't wait to see her again!!  Next album please :)
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swift puts on a wonderful show! Everything was perfect and the opening act as well as the guest performer were all awesome
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor Swift truly puts on the best show I've ever seen. Getting to see Sabrina Carpenter was the cherry on top!!!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The Eras Tour was the best concert I have ever been to. I had great seats and Sabrina Carpenter was a surprise guest the night I was there.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour was an unforgettable experience! The concert, the music, the camaderie, the outfits, the friendship bracelets, the people, and Taylor herself were all PHENOMENAL!!! There are no words to describe the amount of sheer excitement and happiness that was felt that evening and all the moments while I was there. It felt like my heart was going to burst out my chest with JOY! The only thing is that I wish there was more merchandise available, by the time I got to the front of the line, everything that I wanted in my size was no longer available, that was the only sad part of the evening."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I have been to A LOT of concerts and the Era's Tour was so much more than I ever imagined. The music and performance, of course, was amazing but the whole experience in NOLA and with all the other fans, etc, it was just magical."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,3rd time I have seen Taylor swift and it just keeps getting better and better !!! She is the best performer and her stage presence is unmatched !!
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor put on the best concert we’ve ever been to. Gracie Abrams and Sabrina Carpenter as surprise guest was amazing!! New Orleans didn’t disappoint
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras tour was phenomenal! The ease of entrance into the venue, the helpfulness of the Caesar Superdome staff, and Taylor and her dancers, backup singers, stagehands, were amazing and brought the stadium down with a Once in a lifetime experience! Thank you for everything!!!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Great show, amazing performance.  This was one of the best productions I have attended.  3+ hours of non stop fun."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor is a mastermind and it amazes me that she draws the crowd that she does and creates the energy and excitement she does for all of her fans.  The whole night was electric.  The venue was awesome too...with this many people, the lines were manageable and the event was well organized.  This was a gift for my 14 year old son who loves Tay!  He gets teased so much for being a boy and liking Taylor Swift, but he doesn't care--he likes what he likes.  Thank you, Taylor Swift for living up to the hype and making my son's dreams come true!"
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,i genuinely don’t think i’ve ever been to a concert like that and don’t know if i ever will again. the energy of the crowd was insane and the performance that taylor put on for over 3 hours cannot be topped. i love her and will forever cherish NOLA n1 🤍
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"We were in line for an hour to get merchandise and smaller sizes were sold out. Ended up having to get a medium pullover that fit like an extra large. Then we waited 30 minutes to get a pretzel and a pizza. The pizza was very good. Then we had to find where to get a wrist band to allow us access to our floor seats. By the time we actually got to our seats, 2 hours had expired. Seats were extremely crowded and rows barely fit a persons legs. Although her stage is long, floor seats are not the greatest depending on where you are compared to the main stage."
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This concert was SO amazing and top notch!!!! She is a fabulous performer and the production is spectacular! I have been a fan of Taylor since the beginning and I am so happy I was able to see her in my hometown.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This was an unbelievable experience like nothing I have ever experienced!  The venue was great and the production and atmosphere was so wonderful. Taylor Swift is remarkable. I feel so privileged to have been a part of the experience.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Absolutely hands down amazing! My niece also said best night of her life too (she's 18). Well worth the money - even the ones I got that were severely overpriced from a different seller
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,It was my first concert and I love it!! I’ve waiting so long to go the Eras Tour and I was so happy with my experience.
10/29/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"i loved the energy in the stadium. both her opener gracie, and taylor were so lively. amazing artists who do amazing jobs."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Iykyk. Life will never be the same. She moved mountains that I have been pushing forever. Not even kidding. Love isn’t a strong enough word to encapsulate the feeling. Just eternally grateful and lucky to be able to see her. Ticketmaster you did fans so wrong on this tour. Please help us get tickets into the hands of fans in the future.
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The show was amazing! I managed to get last minute tickets behind the stage, but had the best night of my life. It was non stop singing and dancing."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Update: in addition to Taylor being the best live performer with great choreography, band and dancers. Her opener Gracie Abrams was also amazing live!!!!! Literally had the best time ever!!!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The entire city was incredible!  The show was breathtaking and beyond moving!  I wish more people could have attended at a reasonable $, there should be a better way to stop the poaching."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour was INCREDIBLE! From the stage sets to the dancers and special effects, I would go to this concert 10 more times to experience every single detail from the costumes to the so very talented backup dancers, I was able to experience this with my 10 yr. old daughter and will cherish the memories we made forever!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was the best show I’ve ever seen. The production was so good, I was having the best time even in my nosebleed seats. Taylor put on a great show! She was fantastic."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This being my 2nd show. Taylor NEVER disappoints 🫶🏼 .. greatest tour of all time 🩷
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Taylor swift was so professional. Such amazing talents she has. Her song writing singing dancing and the way she connected to her audience was genuine. The back drop and special effects were amazing. The singer that came on before taylor was amazing. I took both my grown married daughters and my grandaughter who is 7 years old. I had great memories with them to remember from the concert.
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras tour was the most magical experience! From start to finish, each detail was absolutely amazing. Best concert tour ever! Only Taylor can top Taylor. Cannot wait to se what she does next!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Long time fan and seeing her live was just nothing but a dream come true. Her live performances were amazing and definitely had true Swifties in the crowd. It felt like a giant karaoke session with the original artist leading it. Love her storyline and choreography with each song and especially TTPD!!! Her dancers and bands were fire! And videographers and background graphics were impressive! Screen quality feels like 10K because of how clear it looks even for the ones who are not in floor or section 100s. Still mindblown how she performs for 3.5 hours and new surprise songs at each event. Would love to see her at another ERAS tour before it is over. 😭🥹
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor was amazing! She is truly a master of her craft, and puts on an amazing show with the help of her entire crew. I loved every minute ❤️"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Classy, family friendly, costume and performance translations were smooth, enjoyable and fast moving. I was very very impressed and would attend her concerts again. Her interaction with the audience was heartfelt and sincere. The audience was respectful of each other and the performers. It was a great atmosphere."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Era’s Tour surpassed all my expectations. Taylor is so unbelievably talented in all aspects and being able to witness that first hand is a memory I’ll never ever forget. I do have massive issues with Ticketmaster and the way the ticketing was handled. Allowing resellers to purchase and list on other sites, etc. and the amount of scams that happened to innocent people is absolutely disgusting. The price gauging, etc. has truly dampened the concert experience and should be a crime. Thankfully my ticket was legit and I personally had no issues, but the amount of people did is insane. I’m begging Ticketmaster to dive deep into this issue and fix it."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"There aren’t enuf adjectives to describe the awesome, fabulous and phenomenal concert!!  Taylor’s talent is out of this world!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,It did not live up to my wildest dreams… maybe karma on my part for spending that kind of money on tickets. Lesson learned.
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"ACTUALLY THE BEST CONCERT EVERRR!! All seats are great, just being in the stadium is the biggest gift 🫶 I’m forever a changed person!!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was such an incredible experience! The energy, execution, and the performances were flawless (from Taylor and her dancers/band)."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The Eras Tour can only be described as magical. Taylor is one of the best performers of our generation and I'm so thankful for the opportunity to experience her catalog live. 3.5 hours have never passed so quickly in my life.
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Top notch experience! Venue was great, artist was great, everything was perfect!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Three and a half hours of 65,000 people on their feet dancing, singing together in raucous joy! Young and old and in all shapes and sizes."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,From the facility to the show was an amazing experience! Taylor Swift was phenomenal❤️
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Such an amazing concert, the light up bracelets, the stage, the non stop performances! Taylor was such an amazing experience.  Hope to see her again in the future!!!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Missed her when she was in LA so flew out to NOLA just for the concert. I’ve been to many concerts of many musical genres, but the quality of all the songs (obvious), musicianship, and detail and pageantry of the entire 3.5 hour performance, along with the unbridled enthusiasm of the entire crowd of all ages and her interactions with us, made it the best show I’ve ever seen. Also a big thanks to NOLA for being so welcoming and accommodating. Sooo glad I went. Worth every penny."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Amazing time! Great show, production, seat location, access to VIP food and drinks, kind staff! Only one mishap… I had a poor experience with another patron. Which is unfortunate because all Swifties are usually quite lovely….
During intermission between Gracie Abrams’s set and the count down clock to TS, my friend and I exited our row to go to the bathroom and snap a couple of photos. We came back before the count down even began. The lady at the end of our row made a very snarky comment… asking if we were going to be coming in and out during the middle of the concert. I answered, no ma’am. And she replied, because it’s very annoying and I’m not letting anyone come out during the concert. 
Yikes!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,13/10. Taylor and her team are phenomenal and I am so glad I got to experience this tour more than once🫶🏻 I would go to every single show if I could because that's how amazing her and her team are. There are no bad seats at the eras tour (except maybe next to me because i was screaming the lyrics the entire time).
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The Eras Tour was absolutely AMAZING. I saw Taylor in 2006 a few months before debut came out and I have been a fan ever since. I hope when she goes on tour again, Ticketmaster gets their act together. Despite being a verified fan and being on the waitlist, I never got picked to buy tickets, including the day of. Resale tickets need to have a cap."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This was the best night of my life to watch Taylor Swift live with my daughter and man of mine. Majestically Amazing Event and memory made together. :) NOLA
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I loved every second of the concert! No one prepares you for the After Taylor swift concert depression once it’s over! But I would do it all over again.  I had “nose bleed”, side of stage where the big screen was and  still could see. The only parts couldn’t see live was when she was at the back of the stage (ie the man). I definitely want to go back asap."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I’ve loved Taylor my whole life and getting to go to this tour made me happier than I can express. Everything from the performance to the lights to the stage was amazing. She’s truly talented.
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The Eras tour was all the hype and more! I can not say enough good things about the experience. I just wish tickets were easier to come by so my whole family could have experienced it together!
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This was my second time, and I didn’t imagine it would be even better! It was so worth seeing again!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This show was absolutely incredible, really well done, and the lighting was AMAZING!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Unreal in every sense of the word. Sign me up for every tour Taylor does. She is amazing.
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"I had the time of my life at the Taylor Swift show in the Superdome on Friday, October 25th. Overall the merchandise and concessions were a well-oiled machine. My only complaint is that the stairs in the upper level were about double the size of a normal stair. It was extremely difficult to get up and down them."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Once in a lifetime experience! I am a fan of Taylor Swift's music but am not a Swiftie (I don't follow her on social media, I don't look for easter eggs in everything she does, and I am not concerned with her personal life). The concert is an amazing 3 hour ride through all her albums. The music is incredible and the visuals of the stage and special effects were beautiful. I wish that everyone who likes her music would get a chance to go to her concert because it is everything you could wish for and more. She is a talented performer and it is a perfect show!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"This goes without saying, but truly life changing. So grateful to get to see her and would go again in a heartbeat!! Best show ever!"
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"SO Amazing. Taylor really puts on a great show. I'm so fortunate to have gotten tickets at FV. If I could go to every show, I would."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"The most incredible concert experience ever. I’ll be talking about this for the rest of my life. And the energy from the fans was unmatched. 70k people singing together. Actual chills. And honestly, swifties make anywhere feel like the safest place on earth."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Over 3hrs of non stop performance. Great play list, great seats. We couldn’t have asked for more! I loved it."
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,This was the BEST CONCERT EVER!! The staff were amazing! Ticket lines went quickly. The seats were pretty awesome! I got to mark seeing Taylor Swift in concert off my bucket list!!
10/28/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Not only a concert.. but an experience! This concert was pure magic! 1000/10
1/31/25,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"From start to finish it was a smooth process. Parking was very expensive, t it the venue is great! Taylor swift put on one of the best live shows I’ve ever seen. Her surprise songs were definitely the songs my friend I were showed to get. It was rare I was there. I remember it (or not so) Well"
12/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert was awesome. Great seats. But we never received our VIP box. Very disappointed.
11/25/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The eras tour was an experience of a lifetime!! I’ve never been to a concert like this one! Taylor puts on an amazing show singing some of her greatest hits. The outfits, choreography, and everything is just so perfectly executed."
11/22/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I saw Morgan wallen at Lucas oil and the music quality was eh. I was nervous for Taylor bc I read online that the acoustics weren’t great to performers in there - but Taylor was amazing!! I was in the nose bleeds and still had an amazing experience. The show started on time and it was so amazing and worth the money! Best concert ever!
11/20/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I could never say enough good things about this tour. It was everything my daughter and I could have dreamed of. The fight to get tickets was horrendous, but the venue itself was amazing. The security team was phenomenal, everyone we interacted with was so kind, and the merch stands were set up very well considering how busy they were. It was easy to get to our seats and find the nearest restroom. I loved that because of the demographic, men’s restrooms were converted to women’s as well, I never had to wait in line more than a few minutes. And the concert itself was the absolute best concert I’ve ever been to hands-down, the production is insane."
11/14/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"As a fan of over 18-19 years. It was always my dream to see Taylor in concert! Seeing the eras tour was one of the most magical experiences and nights of my life! The whole experience and atmosphere of being with thousands of other swifties just being ourselves and having the absolute best time! It was a healing moment for the younger self in me in such a way I never thought possible! The kindness and love shown everywhere throughout the concert was incredible! And it was all because of Taylor Swift and her whole team for putting on such a beautiful performance for over 69,000 people! We were so lucky to have gotten to go and if we could we would do it a thousand times more! Just amazing! Thank Taylor Swift for everything and being the most loving and fun person that you are! Being a fan of you just makes life a little easier-all thanks to you and your wonderful team!"
11/14/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I truly had the best time of my entire life seeing Taylor in concert! The show doesn’t feel like it’s 3.5 hours long because you’re just having so much fun!
11/12/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Of course this is 5 stars. No notes. Taylor is the queen of entertainment for a reason.
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Taylor Swift concert was Fantastic and Amazing, of course.  The experience of using Ticketmaster was Terrible - Long wait times, uncertain times of tickets dropping, finally being in the Queue, only to get to the front of the line, here we go, let's buy tickets... Only to be kicked out and told tickets were gone. Then able to get back in the Queue... And the same thing over again. Ticketmaster needs to do better. And needs to weed out sales to scalpers!!"
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Best concert experience of my life. Everyone was friendly dancing in the aisles. All security treated all fans well. Gracie Abram’s was fantastic & Taylor flawless and wonderful, beyond our expectations."
11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift was such an amazing experience! She put on a beautiful show and performed for more than three hours! We loved second!!
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It was such an amazing experience finally seeing Taylor in person after purchasing tickets well over a year ago. Her voice is truly ethereal, I would go 10 times over if I could"
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Beautiful performance, inspiring lyrics and embodiment of female empowerment and so much fun."
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I thought her concert was phenomenal. The part that was bad was getting our wrist band to get to the floor level.  Very unorganized and took forever, in the longest line, missed all the preshow. When you pay that much money you should get all you need as you go through the ticket line and not another line."
11/8/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Concert was beyond amazing, because she is amazing. Outstanding performance and production"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert started on time .  Taylor sang and danced her heart out.  The dresses and dances are amazing!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,this was such an amazing show! i love taylor so much and ticketmaster allowed me to see her!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was truly the best night ever!! I went to Taylor with my girlfriend's and we had the best time! It was amazing screaming the songs together. I have been a swifty for forever and am SO grateful I got tickets to the Era's tour!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The show was incredible! It was my second time going to the Eras tour. It was way better than the first time because I got to see the TTPD set! I wish I could go again!! Gracie Abrams and Taylor Swift were amazing!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Everything went perfect. The stars must of been aligned for us. We were able to score great seats! Entering the venue was quick and easy. The show was so spectacular!!! The excitement of the whole stadium was infectious! The energy in the room was something that I’ve never before experienced! Thank you Taylor for the amazing show and the memories of sharing it with my girls…priceless ❤️
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I was lucky enough to get 2 tickets to see Taylor Swift night 2 in Indy. I got the tickets a month in advance and they immediately appeared in my account with a count down to when I was able to transfer them. I was also lucky that I was not one of many who got scammed. I received my tickets on the date it had promised and was able to transfer them to my phone right away! The seats were right together, although I was not aware that our seats were against a concrete barrier where people come in and out/up and down the stares. If I had purchased 1 ticket over myself and brother would have been split between this wall. Again I was lucky that, that wasn’t the case and we had the best night ever."
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor puts on an amazing show.  3 and 1/2 hours of music. Definitely worth every penny. Plus Taylor has the nicest fans!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert we have ever attended. The people around us were very friendly and we were trading bracelets and decorated sunglasses. It we just special.
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Probably the best concert I’ve ever been to. My seat was in section 625, but I could still see everything and it was an amazing concert. She really knows how to put on a show and all the people I was around were super friendly."
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert I have ever attended.  The atmosphere was electric and she did an amazing job.  One song after another without hardly a break.  So glad I was able to experience it!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Great show fabulous. Taylor Swift is pure talent undoubtedly.
The only issue and disappointment was that Taylor Swift did not sing that extra 20 minutes after 11.00 pm on Sunday show like she did for the Friday and Saturday shows. There were no surprise songs and she did not sing Reputation. I was very disheartened. If she did that for the Friday and Saturday shows, she should have also been fair for the Sunday show. 
But my dream come true to see her live on stage was just mesmerizing. She is still the BEST. LOVE YOU TAYLOR

Yours truly
A true Swifty"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Everything about it was amazing! From the crowds heading towards the venue, the entry process, and navigating the venue, it all went smoothly. I also loved the  additional screens we could view especially sine my 7 year old needed a nap at 10 pm in order to last through the end of the night. I was able to watch the show from my seat as she slept. The noise was INSANE! I am so glad I brough ear protection for my daughter AND for me! Though it was ear-piercingly loud, the sound was amazing. Taylor did a phenomenal job at keeping everyone (all 69k of us) engaged. 
I will say we were slightly disappointed that there were not surprises or anything on night 3 of Indy, which was the final US show ever. But alas, happy to be there!"
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift puts on such an amazing show!! Everyone should get to experience a Taylor Swift concert at least once in their life. The best performer!!!
11/7/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor was amazing! We kept talking about how she puts on a 3-1/2hr show and doesn’t take a break! Then she goes to do it three nights in a row! I work an 8 hour day sitting at a desk and I’m exhausted! She was built for this! The show was flawless!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was my second time seeing Taylor. My daughter was in heaven and it made me so happy to see her so happy 🥰.  The show itself was AMAZING!! She put on a great show from start to finish. We were on our feet and dancing the whole time.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I was so excited to attend the eras tour. Got my tickets through verified fan in August 2023 and had been looking forward to it for nearly 15 months. After Gracie’s set, we went to the bathroom before Taylor came on. Unfortunately, my husband passed out and needed stitches and further evaluation due to the trauma sustained to his face. We missed the entire show. I am completely heartbroken and devastated. My husband is okay and that is of the upmost importance. It still stings to have had to sit this one out. Once in a lifetime…I saw some videos from N3 and heard rave reviews. I know it was a great show, Taylor always gives 100% and is one of the best entertainers of our time. Now I’m just praying I can manage to snag Toronto tickets and finally get to see the show!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Not only was the atmosphere of the concert the most supportive and welcoming place I have ever been to, but the show was incredible. From the opener to the visuals, the entire show was so well-planned and entertaining. The dancers were so talented and really made you feel so included. The chants and bracelets added so much. I have never seen a concert like this!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Never a bad moment, never a bad seat, and always an amazing performance! Absolutely incredible and no doubt worth every second! Every act a solid 10/10."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This is a once in a lifetime concert. Taylor puts on a show like no other artist. We had the best time ever.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The best show ever she truly loves and cares for her fans and we love her back it’s something I will always look forward to miss Taylor’s swift NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!!!! I will always try to go see her everytime!!!!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The Eras Tour was amazing! Incredible. There are no words to properly describe this insane experience! Haha. wow! It was rare. I was there.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"First,  Taylor Swift is AMAZING!!! What an amazing show she put on! From start to finish,  our  experience with ticketmaster and the Lucas Oil venue was absolutely great! I was one of the lucky verified fans who got an access code. My girls and I were so so excited to be able to watch Taylor for the first time! The venue was clean and great seating with great views no matter where you sit! Hoping to go to many more Taylor Swift concerts!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The ultimate concert experience! I hope everyone gets to go to a Taylor Swift concert at some point in their life!! Even if you aren’t a swiftie! To see her show is an insane experience!! So happy we got to attend the last ever US eras tour show
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert I’ve ever been to. Looked like they put a lot of work into the performance
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This wasn’t a concert, it was an experience. Everything about the concert was beautifully staged. My expectations were exceeded"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,10/10 night Taylor really knows how to put on a show. More of an experience than a concert
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I’m not sure I’ll ever stop talking about experiencing The Eras Tour in Indy with one of my best friends. It’s hard to put into words just how incredible her show was. You could feel the passion she poured into every single detail, every single second and I can’t imagine the effort and care it took to create that experience for us.
She made us feel like we were part of something so special. Indy, thank you for an unforgettable night, and Taylor—thank you for sharing your magic with us! Your fans love you!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The concert was amazing! She is an incredible performer and continuously for over 3 hours! Our seats were high up but we were able to enjoy every minute!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"There’s no words to explain how amazing Taylor performs. This was my second time seeing her and it was a dream come true to see the Eras tour on the last U.S show. Until next time Taylor, long live🫶🏻"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,My daughters and I were able to finally experience the magic that is the Eras tour in person and it’s did not disappoint! The atmosphere since we set foot in the stadium was something we have never felt before. All staff was beyond friendly. You would think that it might have been a stressful event with so many people present but it was actually the opposite.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,We loved every minute of it! Taylor is amazing! Gracie also was wonderful!! Thank you ladies for an extraordinary night. #GIRLPOWER
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Words cannot describe how amazing this show was. I knew it was going to be great, and I was still shocked at how much better it was than I could have imagined. Magical."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Thank you Taylor and your whole team for a wonderful night of dancing, music, a show, lights and so much fun!! EXCELLENT"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The concert and Taylor Swift were great.  We were section 638, row 21, and our seats were absolutely obstructed.  If I stood up, I could see the point of the middle diamond of the stage, and if I sat my view was blocked by people standing.  There was this overhang thing from the ceiling that blocked our view.  I wish I had bought obstructed view tickets because at least I could have seen a Jumbotron :("
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I was going to this show to take my daughter.  It was the best concert I have ever attended.  I am a converted Swiftie now and can’t stop thinking about how amazing it was.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The city welcomed all the TS fans with open arms and created a safe, fun and exciting city to all who came to town. The show that Taylor put on was amazing, but honestly, that is an understatement. I can't even find words to describe the event. I do know that it will be a concert that I will remember for the rest of my life and I was so happy to experience it with my 11yo daughter. You could just feel the positivity electrify you as you walked around the stadium before the show. It was a safe space for everyone to truly be themselves with no judgement! Lucas Oil Stadium was a fantastic venue to see this concert. The sounds was top notch! I would definitely go back to see a concert at this venue and with 100% see Taylor Swift on her next concert excursion, whenever that is. :)"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Love Taylor so much! She was amazing and the concert was epic. Ticketmaster… do better.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"we had seats in the 600s level of Lucas Oil Stadium and I can confirm no seat is a bad seat at a Taylor Swift concert. The visuals, performance, and choreography were mind blowing and there was not a single person in the room that was not engaged. Ms. Swift put on a performance of a lifetime and had a great time doing it. The care and love for her fans and her staff was apparent. If I had the chance to go again I would no matter what the cost."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I had the absolute time of my life!!! best concert i’ve ever been to. drove almost 10 hours there and back and would do it all over again
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Second Era's Tour show Night 1 was Cincy Night 2 and This show was Indy Night 3.  This show was Fantastic.  Started out with a Brilliant performance from Gracie.  She was an absolute delight and her music is so good still can't stop singing her songs.  Then Ms. Swift adding the TTPD set and felt like an entire new show from before. Vocals were amazing the dancing the band the backup singers all were terrific.  This was my favorite concert EVER !!! I'm sad that's its ending but so thankful and lucky to have seen the last US show of this historic event and already counting the days until she's back on tour.   Please take as much time as you need and we will miss and see you again soon.  ❤️🥰.  Love you Tay. Thanks for everything.  Thank you Gracie Sabrina and everyone else who performed with you special guests.  All the dancers backup singers the Band. All the crew that helped set it all up and take it down and anyone else involved.  Oh and Travis of course keep slaying Brother.   ❤️❤️❤️❤️
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I went with my daughter to the Eras tour in Indy.  It was her first ever concert and my first since Covid.  The show was amazing and Taylor was electric.  I feel that my daughter will be ruined for future concerts if she is expecting the headliner to be on stage for 3.5 hours.   Everything about the concert itself was great (crowd, lights, sound, performers, etc). 

My complaints have to do with merchandise and food.  The lines were long and wait was horrendous.  We waited an hour in one of the merch lines.  I ordered and paid for a pizza and then had to wait 10 minutes for it to be ready.  Those two things combined caused me to miss the opening act.  

All things considered I did enjoy myself and would recommend for everyone to see this show regardless of fandom."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"She is the most talented musician I have ever seen live. I need her cardio routine. She is absolutely insane in the best way. I will never forget this tour. Also, her Mom waved at us!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This isn’t just a Concert.  This is a spectacular production put on by an amazing Woman!  This was My first time seeing Taylor Swift in Concert.  I’ve been an OG Fan since Debut!  I’ve just never had the opportunity to see her in Concert before.  I hope I can do it again soon!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Best show I’ve ever seen, nothing can top it besides Taylor swift again probably! Amazing. Me and my mom had the best night ever"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It has been my dream since I was a little girl to watch Taylor Swift perform at a concert.  The little girl inside of me was rebuilt on November 3rd at her last USA show in Indianapolis, Indiana. When I got the email that I had received with the pre-sale code to access these tickets, I was in utter disbelief that this was real, then actually managing to get seats shocked me more.  The seats I had were a perfect view of the stage and it was truly magical.  I definitely will be on the lookout for any future tours Taylor Swift decides to do because she is such a fun person that loves interacting with the crowd. Ticketmaster made sure that my tickets were safe from August 2023 until November 3rd 2024, and I want to thank them for making sure they were secure.  Without the security Ticketmaster has, I would not have been able to watch my favorite artist on stage.  If you have never gone to a Taylor Swift concert, you are missing out.  It is such a magical experience being there."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I have been to countless concerts in my life. As a former employee of a radio station, I have seen every genre of artists perform.
It This was something I have never experienced.  From the production value, those working behind the backstage, to the crew, sound, lighting, band, backup singers, dancers, to Taylor herself; it rocketed past every bar that had been set.  To feel like you were at an intimate concert while surrounded by 70,000 fans is insane. What a gift to be able to make everyone feel included and special.

As a fan of Taylor’s from Debut on, it was such a treasured moment to share this experience with my daughter, who has been raised on her music.  Wholly worth the wait.

And the fans? Top notch.  Respectful, kind, and overjoyed to bond over the entirety of moments together.  These are truly memories to last a lifetime.

Thank you to Taylor and her entire team.  What you have done is unimaginable.  It is spectacular and beautiful and otherworldly.  Thank you, thank you, thank you."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I think that this night was something I truely will never forget. I drive ten hours and I would do it times one hundred in order to see that show again. She is such an incredible human for performing like that. I really wouldn’t know what I would do without her. Surprise songs. Don’t even get me started…
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"2nd time to see the Eras Tour, and it was as magnificent and magical as the first time. The price of the resale tickets was absolutely gut wrenching, but the show itself was worth every penny."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Great venue. Taylor is incomparable. The Eras Tour really is a magical as you think it is going to be.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Taylor Swift concert on November 3 in Indianapolis was everything I dreamed of—and so much more! From the moment she stepped on stage, Taylor radiated pure energy, and her talent was absolutely mind-blowing. She crafted an experience that felt so personal and unforgettable, making every single person in that crowd feel seen and part of something special.

Every detail was flawlessly thought out, from the breathtaking set designs to the incredible outfits, and you could just feel how much she loves what she does. She gave us an entire night of magic, and I left feeling so lucky to have witnessed it. I’m beyond thrilled for her and can’t wait to see what she does next. If it’s anything like this, we’re all in for something amazing!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,My daughters and I went and this was the absolute best concert I’ve ever seen. So thankful we had the opportunity to be there in person.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Incredible performance, fantastic venue, easy entry, everyone was incredibly nice and helpful. She is an amazing performer"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Taylor Swift shows are amazing! The atmosphere is electric. But one of my daughters hadn’t been before and the seats we had to her 3rd Indy show should never have been available to buy. The announcers box was blocking our view of anything above or beyond the stage so we didn’t get the full view of anything. Every picture I took had that box in it or I zoomed in under it so it wasn’t in the picture. It also blocked the big screen across the stadium and the little screen on the side of the stage wasn’t really adequate. Had they said anything about it being an obstructed view, I wouldn’t have bought the tickets. The tickets said side view, which I was prepared for. Not an obstructed one."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,T. Swift never fails to disappoint!  The concert and venue were outstanding- no complaints!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The concert itself was amazing the experience to get the tickets was terrible. Taylor and her crew had an outstanding performance, the songs with the lighting went perfectly."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift puts on an incredible show. It was an unforgettable experience for me and my 3 daughters.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The show was fantastic however could not see a full Jumbotron screen at all! Bothe were either blocked by the overhead ceiling, Speakers, lights etc. they had smaller screens in our section but were not turned on. Wish this information (ie may not be able to view screens etc) would have been available before purchase of tickets"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,It was a dream come true! Best night of my life! Only regret is not going last summer as well!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I chose to do the last night in Indianapolis as a gift to my daughter for Christmas last year and it was a couple days before my 40th. The crowd and atmosphere were amazing, the venue was awesome with crowd control and security and of course Taylor was the BEST ! She is such a great artist and in person was so worth the 13hr drive !"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,this was the happiest day of my entire life i have never been around such positivity ever. i absolutely love taylor swift for bringing the world joy with her music and making such a safe place for a girls to be girls.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Most amazing concert experience ever. I got my tickets at face value, but they were worth every penny. So good. Swift is a beast."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,One of the best performances and concerts I’ve ever had the privilege to attend. Full of energy and it never stopped from start to end. Truly one of the greatest artist of our time.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This was my first time seeing her live and words cannot capture exactly how I felt. It was literally the best night of my life, and I definitely want to see her again. It was such a surreal feeling, realizing that after months of planning, I finally was going to see my favorite artist in the world perform live. I definitely cried multiple times during the show and found many parts to be cathartic and damn near healing. Taylor has a way of capturing everyone’s attention and holding it for 3 1/2 hours, while also leaving us wanting more. I could’ve watched her for hours and can cross something off my bucket list."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It’s hard to imagine how a 3.5 hour show could be any better. The talent in the song writing, performance, vocals, production, etc is just unreal. If you can go, go to the eras tour"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Taylor Swift's Eras Tour lives up to the hype in every way. Best concert I've ever been to. She's AMAZING. 

The only negative was the view from my seat. I was up high, which was fine, but the center of the stage was blocked by speakers. Taylor performed much of her show from the center of the stage, so I missed all of that. My ticket did not mention anything about view obstruction. With how much I paid for this ticket, I would have expected some warning that my view was going to be obstructed."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Concert gave all attendees the full experience not a bad view. Obviously much attention was given to provide each attendee with a unique view of the show.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Very well organized at Lucas Oil. 70k people in one building, and I never felt overwhelmed. And of course, Ms. Swift knows how to put on a show!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I fought the Great War, and it happened!  So excited!  I refreshed every second, and I scored $49 tickets to Taylor Swift N3 in Indy!!!  It was amazing!!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor is a force! Her show was exceptional!!  I feel so lucky to have witnessed such an epic night!!!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This was the best show I’ve ever been to. The venue was great, merch lines were easy to navigate and all staff were amazing."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor swift was incredible to see in person. She and her team put on an amazing show that was thourougly entertaining the entire time. She is amazing live and I wish I could go again
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"taylor swift is the most incredible beautiful talented performer you will ever see in your entire life. the production value of her show is second to none. she’s the only person who can make a three plus hour show feel like it wasn’t long enough! as long as she is touring, i will do everything in my power to see her."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Amazing show !! The show was fantastic ! The admission process was quick and easy. Sound and lights were spot on. The only issues were terrible long lines for merch and food.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"What an incredible experience. Taylor is stunning and such a fantastic performer. Singing with 70,000 people is something I will never forget."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Personally, I love the show and Taylor, but I wish that there was more video shown of the background/main set that was completely obstructed from view from the sides of the stage. In particular, there was a house scene that exists on the background that was basically not shown the entire show. I only know it exists because of the Eras tour movie. This was a disservice to the fans and to the artist that the visual aesthetics were not conveyed hardly at all to a good proportion of viewers. 
Other than that, the venue was a great location for a show."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I am speechless. No words. The best concert I have ever been to ever. Nothing will ever beat Taylor Swift.
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I’m 62 years old and have attended many concerts in the past. This concert was like nothing I’ve ever seen. Taylor Swift is outstanding on so many levels. And then add in the lighting, sound and overall production of the show…phenomenal!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The best concert I’ve ever been to, great performer and great fans. Only problem was stadium was confusing to navigate and staff couldn’t really tell us where we were going. Would definitely go again!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Lights, sound, band, performance, everything was at the highest level of excellence!!"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The Eras Tour is a once in a lifetime experience!! It’s beyond your wildest dreams!! I have never felt happier than when I am at the Eras Tour!! 🫶🏼
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best show I have ever seen. Shoutout to Taylor swift you are good at singing
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The Eras Tour was so amazing and I’m so lucky that I was able to go with my friend especially for the last show in the US! It is an amazing experience and the singing (of course) and visuals are beautiful! I wish everyone was able to go
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Everyone needs to experience this show! I could not stop smiling!! You could tell Taylor and her other performers were having genuine fun while entertaining us. It was a dream to take my 14 year old daughter to this show as her 1st ever concert! Definitely made some core memories! Thank you!!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,By far the best concert I have ever been to! Ticketmaster could have done better overall but I’ll always be grateful I won the great war II. We love you Tay!
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Eras Tour was a once in a lifetime experience . Taylor Swift is an incredibly talented performer , her dancers and musicians are amazing . The TTPD addition was incredible ! I really hope she tours again and gives this album the limelight - but if you get the chance to go - GO!! Worth every penny"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I’ve been to thousands of concerts of all genres. Nothing compares to this. Well worth the 4k I spent on my ticket as wild as that sounds,"
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"words can’t describe how incredible this concert was. i was in a daze after. i couldn’t even believe that i went. even though my seats weren’t amazing, i was still so grateful to be there! if resale prices were cheaper, i’d go again."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Had the privilege of taking my family to this concert. An honorary “Swiftie” through my kids enjoyment of her music.  I too enjoy what I know of it, my kids know all of it. The atmosphere, the energy, the emotions felt during her show were nothing one can put into words. It was simply amazing. Performing for three plus hours without missing a beat, the engagement with the audience, she had our attention from beginning till end. This was not just any event or concert, it was an experience we will remember and cherish the rest of our days."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I've seen some pretty incredible shows with spectacular fireworks and acrobatics, but Taylor Swift's show overshadows all others.  She has a way of engaging the entire audience and reaching the show out to the crowd.  I've seen another fantastic artist engage the crowd in the ""cheap seats""but not until the end of the show. Taylor has a way to make every song reach the top rows and the far away seats.  I'm not what you would describe as a ""Swiftie"".  I like maybe half of her songs, but I had to admit that this show definitely deepened my appreciation for her."
11/6/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The BEST concert of my life! I’ve never witnessed anything like it before. I sang and danced the entire time! I love you Taylor!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Taylor is a phenomenon!  A force of positivity, empowerment and inspiration to women of all ages.  She is a true performer and gave the audience everything and more.  I will forever be in awe of what she has done and continues to do at such a young age.  She is brilliant.  The show was next level.  She is multitalented and loved by millions.  Her lyrics move me and have helped me through a very tough year.  Seeing her live in concert was amazing and rejuvenating and healing."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I feel so lucky to have gotten to see the Eras Tour in person, a once in a lifetime experience amongst the best fans, and performed by the most incredible and dynamic artist and her team. It’s not an overstatement to say Taylor’s music has literally been a lifeline for me."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Phenomenal. Absolutely the best concert I’ve ever been to. I was so blessed to get tickets. Real, genuine tears. Everything went a lot smoother than expected. I need a walker & was concerned about how that would go. Swifties are truly the most kind hearted people - we are truly a family. Taylor has a stage presence unparalleled - utterly captivating. Though some say it’s too long, you cannot help but want more. It feels like time just stops - so surreal."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The concert itself was amazing, and Taylor is incredible live, but the best part was how it transformed the whole city into a safe and welcoming space for all. Such a wonderful experience and an all too brief glimpse of how the world could be if we would only be nicer to one another."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift was one of the best live concert performers I have ever seen!  Such great entertainment and energy.  So much fun and an experience I will never forget!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,this was the most amazing concert i have ever seen. it was so magical and in any seat in there was an amazing view. my seat was in the 600s and it was still amazing. i’ve never been to a more unique and lively concert in my life. not to mention the entire audience as well
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift is a phenomenal performer and singer!! I have been a Swiftie since as long as I can remember. The Eras Tour was the best concert I have ever been to! I can’t wait to see what she does next when she comes back to touring!! Highly recommend making it to one of her last shows if you can!!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Unspeakable. Wildest Dreams. Long Live. All the words that come to mind after seeing this amazing show! I’ve been trying to get tix for 2 years and was finally able to enter the queue Oct 31 and snag tix, due to being waitlisted last year, for my daughter and I Saturday night :)"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Taylor Swift is one of the best for a reason! She puts on an amazing show, I was incredibly lucky to be on the floor, and it was incredible. The visuals, the dancers, and the sound was incredible. I would go to all Taylor Swift shows in the future!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I can’t say enough good things about this experience, from the area’s parking availability and policing to the generous size of the venue (including the lobbies) to the friendliness of the concessions workers and ushers (all of whom had on TS friendship bracelets) to the fast-moving merch lines to the roomy seats to the actual concert. It exceeded all expectations."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Favorite concert I have ever been to. The all around talent and production value was amazing. It was the time of our lives for the whole family. Would love to experience a concert like that again.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"A night my girls and I will never forget, thank you to Taylor for an incredible concert - long live all the memories we made! She is perfection!"

11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I have been to several stadium shows by other artists but Taylor Swift's production is on another level! Attending Taylor Swift's Eras Tour was an unforgettable experience that left me in awe. From the moment she stepped on stage, I was completely captivated by the energy and emotion she brought to each song. The way she seamlessly transitioned through her musical eras, from ""Fearless""to ""Midnights,""made me feel like I was on a journey through her life. The visuals were stunning, and I loved how each era had its own unique vibe and choreography. Singing along with thousands of fellow fans created an incredible sense of community. This concert wasn’t just a show; it was a celebration of music and memories that I’ll cherish forever."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"great seats, great show!! second time seeing her and it was just as amazing as the first!!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Amazing spectacular.  What an amazing artist.  Her stamina is unbelievable.  What a rush, it was worth every penny!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This concert was the most magical experience of my entire life. There was no bad moment during the concert. I would definitely recommend it.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was an AMAZING experience!  The Eras Tour was incredible and the entire set up in Indianapolis was perfect.  I stayed at a hotel walking distance from the stadium and that was perfect.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Seeing the Eras Tour was truly one of the best experiences of my life. Taylor put on an incredible performance and it will be an event I remember forever.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Best concert I've seen and i was at the cincinnati Beatles concert! The energy and musical talents of Taylor Swift are undeniable.  My only regret I wasn't younger and had lower seats but it was still magical
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Everything about the whole show was amazing form the set-up, location, stage, opener, and Taylor herself. Everything was super professional and there was a lot of accommodations including lots of extra portable potties which was a huge plus compared to other concerts. Would 100% go to another one if Taylor does more down the road was worth it!. We also had 2 d row seats in section B so we were really close which was a very surreal experience!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Fun night. Event went smoothly. Only wish that the prices/ticket sales were fairer/better.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,this is my second time seeing the eras tour and it changed my life yet again. i almost went into a panic off of how close i was to my queen taylor on the floor. i am never recovering. like ever. she sang my favorite song with me there (thanks girl) anyways love this and love you tay
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"There are no words to describe how amazing this show was. Taylor Swift is by far the best performer of our time. Every single person in that stadium was engaged from start to finis. If you could bottle up the feeling while you are there, you would. Simply amazing."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Together with my daughter, we were lucky enough to see the Eras Tour after following Taylor for 17 years. It was her fourth concert, and it was her best. The beautiful sets, dancing, vocals, and, of course, the star herself have become treasured memories and bucket list items. You still have time to get to Canada if you haven't seen her. Run, don't walk!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The concert was great. Taylor's production and presentation were the best I've seen. Opening Act, Gracie Abrams was super.

Traffic wasn't bad at all and getting into Lucas Oil was smooth and easy."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I really can’t say more other than I will be fighting for tickets anytime Taylor Swift puts on a show near me. I would travel too!! She is the ultimate performer and treats her fans with the utmost respect and care!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"If I could ever dream up the perfect even, it wouldn’t come close to this! It’s a lifetime experience that you can’t replace! I want to go 100 more times. It’s the definition of perfection!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I was able to get into the queue for the drop of more tickets. Once the stage was set. I got the tickets right away, and the queen did not disappoint."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This show was a once in a lifetime experience that you didn’t have to be a Taylor Swift fan to appreciate. I was so privileged to be able to attend.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This night was truly magical & the best night of my life! Taylor Swift is unlike any concert I have ever experienced! She plays for 3+ hours and is constantly showing the crowd how grateful she is to be on stage to perform for us. I am forever grateful I got to go!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I’m a 50 year old swiftie and her shows will never fail to amaze me. You do t even have to be a fan to enjoy the show. It was rare, so was there and I will forever remember Eras Tour 2024!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I've never been to a better show in my life. Taylor puts on an amazing show. Everything was well thought out, event staff were great, and the crowd was the friendliest I have seen."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The best night of my entire life, I’ve never felt more safe & seen in my hometown than I did during this concert. Everyone was so nice & the entire night felt like a dream. I got seats in section 624 & it was the perfect view. I really got to take in everything & for it technically being nosebleeds it did not feel like it whatsoever. I wish I could replay the night over & over & over again. Very grateful to have won the Great Ticketmaster War."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Most amazing concert I have ever seen!!! For 3.5 hours my eyes were full of stars as Taylor captivated the entire stadium of 69,000 people. The outfits are gorgeous and make the whole place shimmer. I was enchanted to meet so many sweet Swifties and trade bracelets may these memories break our fall! And I could go on and on, on and on it was rare I was there I remember it all too well!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Seeing Taylor was life changing! The show itself felt like a fever dream I never wanted to wake up from. The interactions with other fans was definitely the cherry on top! 100000000% recommend
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor was nothing short of phenomenal!! I could not believe her energy and humbleness!! She is one of a kind on this planet!! I would see her any chance that I could! Best concert hands down! I have been to hundreds!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This concert was more of an 'event'.  The fans, the performance, the atmosphere was amazing.  My niece and her best friend had the time of their lives.  White the ticket availability was scarce and the cost ended up being outrageous through a third party, the experience was worth it."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"While Taylor Swift was flawless, our seats were not. We paid an insane amount for resale tickets, which we accepted, but arrived to find our clear view seats were in fact obstructed by the balcony of box seats. We were surrounded by empty seats (for good reason) and were unable to fully enjoy the show and experience with my niece on her 12th birthday. The screen to see what was happening on stage wasn’t working in the beginning, and the errors tour was in full swing. We made the best of it, but not being able to see the main half of the stage with the background screen and props, basically the show, was extremely disappointing, especially for a child at her first concert."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,We had no issues getting in to the stadium and getting to our seats. Show was amazing!

11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Exceeded my already veyr high expectations - she was incredible! The stamina of her talent, the lights, stage, set, crowd, everything was great! the merch lines were long, but we got there too close to showtime so that was our fault. Felt very safe with police presence outside. Overall, great experience"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Taylor is the best entertainer I’ve EVER seen. This was the second show we were able to see. We went to Chicago in 2023 and Indy 2024. It was a true experience! Friendships were made, the feeling of safety with this concert is something you cannot get anywhere else. To be there with 69,000 people and truly belt your heart out to songs that mean things you couldn’t ever find words for was truly therapeutic. Thank you Taylor. You changed my world."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I’ve been to many concerts in my lifetime (I’m 43). This is my fourth Taylor Swift concert and she just gets better and better! Absolutely amazing!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was probably the best show I’ve ever attended and am sad that the tour is coming to an end!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,My girls and I love her music! But I do think even if your not a fan she puts on a fantastic show.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Saw shows and Pittsburgh and Indianapolis, both were incredible. A true professional and show-woman!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Their flow of people traffic was absolutely amazing and it was one of the best night I have had in a while. So happy I got to experience something so remarkable and empowering.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I could not be more fulfilled from attending this event. No let down in any way from her performance. The part that was imperfect was the tickets were VIP and they went from being something that felt special to just a box of stuff and a lanyard. The seats were far away from the stage and while you had a good view of the whole performance, I could have had better seats for much less money. They made changes to the items in the box from the first leg. I think that the merch running out was incredibly disappointing too. 

Again, Taylor was spectacular and I can’t stop smiling but I would have liked something more special for my VIP tickets."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Overall we had an amazing experience at the show. however when purchasing these tickets it said nothign about our view being slightly obstructed by an overhang of seats above us. that would have been nice to have been aware of when purchasing.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This was the first concert I've ever been to, and Taylor truly made it a magical experience! I've heard other acts struggle with the downtime during costume changes and setup between songs, but that was not an issue at the Eras Tour. Even when Taylor wasn't on stage there was a transitional piece going on to prep us for the next era. Nothing compared to hearing her live and knowing she was truly singing for us there in person. Taylor is a true professional and I hope I can see her again in future tours."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The concert was amazing. Taylor always put on a good show, but there was something special About this one. Indianapolis put on a great event for All her fans. I can’t wait till the next one"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Obtaining tickets was easy. The venue was great but could have outlined floor seat entry a bit better. The concert itself was incredible!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This is the best concert I’ve ever been to EVER. The stage, dancers, and of course, Taylor, exceeded all expectations I had"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I had great times and the best night of my life. Taylor Swift performed all the songs I loved.
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Top notch show. Taylor puts on a show like no other. Over three hours of top tier performance. Everyone else should be taking notes, this is a perfect show."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Overall, we had such a great experience. It was our first time attending an event at Lucas Oil Stadium and lemme tell ya, it was awesome. I have been a Colts fan since 1998 but I've never been to a game. I will absolutely have to come back for one. Every single person we interacted with was so nice and helpful. The stadium itself is gorgeous and so well designed. I work in a large arena that hosts big events and I am always curious to experience other venues. Lucas Oil itself and the staff knocked it out of the park. Taylor sounded fantastic and the production was off the charts. One thing I appreciated so much was the ability to see over the row of people in front of me. I am very short so when everyone stands, I worry about being able to see. That was not a problem at all. So fist bump to the stadium designers. I've been to so many concerts in my life and been to a ton of different venues. This Eras Tour at Lucas Oil shot to the top of my list. Obviously, it's Taylor. She and her band and dancers and crew are elite and they know how to put on a brilliant show. But the venue also played a huge part in that as well. And Lucas Oil brought it. I took damn near 500 pictures and video that night so I could remember and re-live this experience over and over again. Thank you to every single person who had anything to do with the Eras Tour in Indy. I will never forget the experience."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It was an honor to be able to experience this concert. It will be something I never forget, and will think about and be thankful to have been a part of for the rest of my life.
Forever grateful to be living in the Taylor’s Version of the world!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This concert was everything I hoped it would be and more!  Taylor put on an incredible show for over three hours. This cost us way more than we would normally spend on a concert, but money can be replenished, memories cannot. The look on our daughter’s face when we told her we were going was priceless. When we can, we will definitely see Taylor again."
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This tour will forever be remembered as one of the greatest musical moments of all time! It is truly insane to be in a stadium of 69,000 people how are all excited and engaged for an entire 3.5 hour concert! Seeing people dressed up and singing and dancing for the entire show was an amazing environment to be in! The production and quality of the show that Taylor and her team put together is also absolutely insane! The set design, the costume changes, the light up bracelets for the audience, it was master piece that changed the music and concert industry! I'm so glad I was able to have this experience!! 1300000000/10 would recommend!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The best show out there. It’s absolutely perfect. The show is so fun and engaging the entire time. Taylor Swift is full of life and joy and spreads that to her audience. It’s hard not to leave a Swiftie
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"10/10 recommend if you have the chance to see TS, she puts on an amazing show!!"
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor Swift gave an outstanding performance. The quality was consistent throughout.  She made her fans feel seen and it made for a very memorable experience. The acoustic part was a perfect add on. It was a 3.5 hour singalong and I loved it all!!!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,T Swift never disappoints!  She is stunning in every way. Her energy is unmatched and her delivery of her music and the way she connects with the crowd is so personal. She promotes an atmosphere of fun & generosity towards others and the crowd mimics this. I met so many people from all over the US & every single one was complimentary and kind and so excited to be there. There was no pushing or judging or criticism. This is what Taylor has created in her fans and her atmosphere. I would go over and over again!!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Spectacular show!  So much fun.  Taylor gives you the most amazing show and she’s non stop for 3 1/2 hours.  Absolutely loved her concert.   Thank you Taylor Swift!!!
11/5/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,One of the most incredible nights of my life. This was my second concert experience and Taylor was absolutely amazing and couldn’t have made it any better! She is the true definition of an ARTIST. Made little me so happy
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Everyone was so kind at The Eras Tour!!! Taylor Swift was AMAZING and the concert was an magical event. I’m sad it’s over and I want to go again!!!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Easy process from start to finish, able to wait in queue and snag two tickets!  Easy to check out, easy to access, great experience!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,best experience of my entire life. she is exquisite and beautiful. the best night of my existence.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the best concert I have ever had the priviledge of witnessing. It was worth all the hype. The music was true Taylor and the crowd was electric. Indianapolis did an amazing job with this event and the city was very welcoming and made it great!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The show was outstanding. Taylor, the music, the performance , the lights, and staging was all spectacular.  Lucas Oil and the city of Indianapolis did a super job hosting the event."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,We had 4 tickets for about $1200 and we went to n1 of Indianapolis it was so great and very trustworthy
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"So excited to have been able to purchase TS tickets having never attended before. I only purchase through Ticketmaster because I thoroughly trust the site. 

Purchased 4 seats with the understanding of having a side view but when arriving at the concert (drove 4 1/2 hours to get there), we had a completely obstructed view in the top level due to an overhang at Lucas Oil Stadium. I understand that the venue was not meant for concerts but this should have been transparent. Football games are very different from concerts. Fans stand throughout the concert so we were unable to see the screen or stage when the row ahead stood (which was 100% of the time) and if we stood, the overhang blocked our view. Very disappointing.

In addition, the acoustics under the overhang didn’t allow us to even hear her because folks were singing. These back four rows should have never been offered. I feel the stadium was set on selling out a concert venue vs. giving folks a great concert experience. Very upset that our family traveled so far for a once in a lifetime experience only to not be able to enjoy it at all.

I heard she was great though. It’s just that the stadium and Ticketmaster should have worked together to understand which seats just wouldn’t work."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The show was amazing but the tickets said side view and they really were back view. We could just see TS when she was in the middle. I don’t think they were worth what we pay for them. Section 347, seat 22"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Lucas Oil handled this huge event perfectly. Getting through security and ticketing was a smooth and streamlined process. Police presence was massive which helped with crowd control and they clearly increased staffing at the stadium in all areas. Made for an excellent experience for guests. Taylor put on an amazing show and I hope Indianapolis continues to be at the top of her list for future tours. We had an ENCHANTING night!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This concert was like nothing I've ever been to before. Absolutely amazing and so glad I went!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Best performance ever. The hard work and dedication from Taylor and her entire team and crew is unmatched.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was my first Taylor concert ever and I feel so grateful for the opportunity to go! I have never felt safer traveling to another state by myself! Swifties were so kind and welcoming! Thank you Taylor and Swifties for this experience!!!!!!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I attended the Eras tour Indianapolis night 1 and had the absolute time of my life I’ve been a life long swiftie and came all the way from  Michigan just to attend this show and everything went smoothly getting merchandise was a breeze, found our seats easily and of course Taylor was amazing if you ever get the chance to see her do it it’s absolutely worth it"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"From the time she came on at 8:07 until she left the stage at 11:30PM Taylor definitely gave fans a wonderful show. She was engaged with the audience and thanked us several times throughout the night. You could tell she was having fun and she made the fans feel so  special!!!
I loved going through the different eras and remembering where  I was during that time! 
I attended with my daughter who sang right along. Definitely a wonderful show experience!!!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The merch lines we so long. The people selling the merch were not encouraging the buyers to hurry. They were allowing people to try on the merch. No one was was walking the lines with pictures of the merch so buyers could make decisions. Also, no one was telling the buyers when something was sold out. I could have bought online and not wasted 4 hours of my time. The only reason I stood in line for that long is because I wanted the blue crew neck. Once it was my turn, it was sold out."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,HANDS DOWN BEST CONCERT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! Nothing will ever compare to it and I will tell my grandkids about it one day! I am SO lucky to have tickets!!!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,It is ridiculous I had to pay 2K for a $90 seat from a secondhand ticket provider. Her concert was fantastic but I’m furious there hasn’t been a solution to the scammer and bot situation.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It is hard to find the right words to describe Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour. It is more than a show. It is an experience from start to finish. It's girlhood at its best. It is a celebration of love, life, joy, saddness, friendship, and everything in between. I attended with my 9 year old daughter. She was blown away by the show - the stage, the theatrics, the talent, everything. We both declared it was the best day ever. This is my Roman Empire - The Eras Tour with my daughter in Indy N1. Every day for the rest of my life I will think about a moment from that day. They are perfect memories that will be cherished for a lifetime. Worth every penny. Worth every line. Worth every moment and mile it took to get there."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"WOW. show was energetic, fun, visually beautiful. So lucky to have got to witness it."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Gracie Abrams and Taylor Swift were AMAZING. The concert was unbelievable, an absolute blast. Venue did fantastic job getting fans in the door quickly and smoothly, we never had to wait in line at all."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I’m so grateful to have been able to experience the Eras Tour. It was everything I had hope for and more. The surprise songs were amazing as I got to hear Exile live!! My favorite folklore song. Taylor was a professional in all ways, waiting for the next tour…"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Everything was so smooth from buying the tickets to checking in at The Eras Tour!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I mean how could you not have the absolute best night ever dancing and singing with Taylor Swift! My favorite experience ever and I’m sad the eras tour is coming to and end, but i’m so excited to see what the future holds for Taylor and us swifties!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I will never forget this night. Taylor Swift was amazing, she is the best! 4 hours non stop dancing, singing, sharing stories with a crowd of 70,000 people. Incredible night!!!  The venue was great."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I’ve never seen anything like it! Taylor is an incredible performer and artist. I will never get over the magic of it all.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The most incredible show I've ever seen. The energy, the lights, the song choices, the set, the transitions, all of it, lives up to the hype for The Eras Tour! Would go again and again if I could!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The VIP package was not worth the extra money. There was no early entry for VIP packages, nor merchandise exclusive to VIP. There was not even merchandise sales on the floor. The line to even get your floor wristband was forever long! Didn't feel like a VIP at all!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The best concert of the decade. Words can’t even come close enough to describe how good it was.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Was able to take the family to see her and it was one for the ages. My two daughters and wife have loved her music for a long time. I decided to surprise them with tickets for all four of us, and it was well worth it. The performance and production were amazing and by far the best show I have ever seen in my life. Great show and highly recommend it"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Great show!! But Ticketmaster you have to get your self together and get rid of the bots! And prevent so much resale for $$$$$
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Lucas Oil stadium did a fantastic job hosting our beloved queen! They turned extra men’s rooms into women’s and the whole experience was super smooth. The show was INCREDIBLE!!! Sound was perfect, dazzling. Outfits wonderful. She was incandescent."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I love music, but this isn't my genre.  BUT, I bought tickets for my nieces and took them.  Taylor is an amazing entertainer!  Plus she played for 3.5 hours straight!  What amazing show.  We had floor seats, but felt like a missing some things, due to being too close."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"It was absolutely everything I had hoped for and more. The night went by too quickly even though she sang for over 3 hours straight. The stage, theatrics, costumes, dancing… all of it. Top notch. The atmosphere of Swifties was infectious. I’m blessed we got to experience this. If you can go, go. You won’t regret it for a second."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Ease of venue was great! I knew this would be a huge event and the city and stadium were ready for it!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"this was literally the best concert of my life, ive never experienced something so amazing. me and my sister had the time of our lives and getting tickets for me here was quite easy i just i wish i was able to get accepted for the other days but other than that i had a blast and taylor is such an amazing performer shes so gorgeous and sounded so amazing she didnt disappoint"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,It was very amazing. She is so talented and I am so glad she shared her gift with the world.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The show was phenomenal. Taylor is not only a great singer, but a performer as well. The show was full of energy and excitement.  She connected with the audience and made us feel welcome to her tour."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Overall the ticket buying process was stressful as I had to deal with the pool of ticket buying. Got tickets though for cheap! The experience at Lucas Oil stadium was great! No concerns getting in or out. The bathrooms for men were changed to women’s so more women could use the bathrooms. The concert was AMAZING! Taylor Swift is an amazing performer, singer,  songwriter, and person."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Second time seeing this tour, first time seeing with the TTPD show. It was absolutely amazing, as always!!!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I seen Taylor at other tours but this one is the TOP of the List! I don’t know how she can get any better than the Eras Tour (though I know she will top this tour at some point) it was everything!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I've been to many I've been to many concerts and none beat Taylor Swift shows, this was the best concert ever"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,My mom and I had the greatest time traveling to Indy and trading bracelets and stickers with other Swifties!! The show was remarkable and so so so much fun!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This concert was an amazing experience! From the interaction not only with other fans but the ease of merchandise as well. This concert will forever live in my mind and I can’t even foresee anything that will surpass this. I highly recommend a Taylor swift concert anytime she performs after seeing this one. The outfits, dances, decor for each set was so on point and brought you into the album."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Going to the Eras Tour was an absolute dream and so when the opportunity to go came I jumped on it and I’m forever grateful I did. The show was absolutely incredible and everything I could have hoped for. My seats were in a great section to see all of the stage and the amazing crowd with me. The sound and atmosphere was just what I needed to end this long 2024 year. If I could go again I would! The stage performance from TS and her dancers was beautiful to watch. I can’t say enough good things about this tour. I can’t wait for a new version of it online!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This was the best concert experience of my life. The city was welcoming, concert goers sharing friendship bracelets, the happiest, safest crowd of 69,000 people I’ve ever seen. Highly recommend! Thank you Taylor"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"What a great show! The venue was great! There was minimal lines getting into the stadium (we did arrive pretty early) so entry to the concert was a breeze! Minimal lines for get drinks, we went a few times. Bathrooms were clean, and lines were not that long and moved “swiftly” :) I did not eat at the stadium but looking around at what people were eating it seemed like there was a fair amount of options provided and the food looked better than I would have expected. 

The concert itself was amazing! Taylor didn’t disappoint and lived up to all of the hype! The atmosphere of the crowd was something I had not experienced. So many young girls, young women, and grown women in such a supportive, loving and caring environment. It truely felt like a safe place! It was nice to see the men at the concert singing along to her songs, whether it was a date night, daddy date night or just there as a swiftly.

Leaving the concert was a bit congested, putting us into a crowed street high on what we all experienced together…. Indianapolis did a great job navigating the crowds, shutting down streets, police presence and even police horses with friendship bracelets! It was nice to see an entire city become Taylorville for a few day, there was not a single place you went that you did not feel her presence. 

I hope to only experience this again!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was the show of a lifetime. I’m going to every Taylor Swift tour after experiencing the Eras Tour.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,BEST CONCERT EVER! There is truly no other show like the Eras Concert. so so blessed to have been able to attend
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"This show was amazing. I would go again in a heartbeat; however, the view was very obstructed.  We could not see the front of the stage and this was not made clear when buying the tickets.  Had we known this, we would have gotten tickets more head on the stage."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,After watching the Taylor Swift: Eras tour on a grainy livestream for the last 2 years we finally got to experience Taylor Swift in person. It was just as magical and I had a great time. She is a movement and I can't wait to get the chance to see her again. I'm so thankful to have gotten tickets in my home state when so many others couldn't snag tickets at all.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Best night of my life! Me and my little sister had the greatest time! So sad it’s over! We had floor seats and the show was amazing! Taylor Swift and Gracie Abram’s put on amazing shows and they sound the exact same live as they do on their albums! So happy and extremely lucky to have been able to experience this and create memories with my sister that will last a lifetime.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,it was AMAZING. Taylor gave us 100% and MORE!!! she does this at every show and she is her own standard!!! Venue was awesome and the people around us even more!!! WE LOVE YOU TAYLOR
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,As always Taylor Swift puts on a good show. Even with technical difficulties from equipment (rain does some lovely things to sound equipment) she put on a 5 star show and made everyone feel amazing.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"First time seeing Taylor Swift and she did not disappoint.  It was amazing from start to finish.  TS is truly a unicorn...such a rare talent...singer, songwriter, entertainer, and businesswoman.  Hope to see her perform again!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,The show itself was great but we missed the opening act because of Lucas oil or whoever arranged the floor bracelet distribution. Entrance to the stadium went smooth. But the one and only area to obtain our bracelet to access our floor seats was horrible. We waited an hour and a half and missed the entire opening act. We expected long lines for the merch but waiting that long just so we could go to our seats is unacceptable. Daughter was literally in tears because she’s a huge fan of Gracie Abrams.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was hands down the best concert I have ever attended. I wish I could go again in Vancouver!!!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Soooooooo good! What a wonderful event. It was so amazing to see Taylor! The ticket process was easy. I was one of the fortunate ones to get the code. I do not like the scammers and scalpers however. Selling tickets for thousands of dollars is ridiculous.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"i’m so glad i was able to get tickets! overall, this concert was an amazing experience on every front. from the production to the choreography to the crowd, 10/10"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,We had nosebleeds tickets and still had the most incredible time. We could see everything (albeit more on the screens) but it didn’t matter. We were in the room and energy was incredible. She performed for 3.5 hours. She makes sure you get your monies worth!!!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,It was the most amazing show I've ever been to. The venue was amazing Taylor was amazing. She most definitely puts on one of the best shows and we were so excited we were able to be the for the one of the last US shows
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,This was an amazing time to spend with my best friend in our daughters. Best concert ever.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Thank you for coming to our beautiful Indianapolis! Taylor Swift was the best concert ever! Indy was totally ""Ready for it!"""
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Getting into the venue/seating was the quickest experience, I have ever had. The staff and security were very friendly and helpful. The venue was beautiful. The seats were the greatest in the whole stadium. Taylor Swift is the GREATEST artist there will ever be! The Eras show is the most magical experience I have ever witnessed. I felt and still feel like I am in a fever dream! EVERYONE had a fabulous time and EVERYONE was super friendly! Taylor Swift is ethereal!! There is no other word to describe her. She is gorgeous, super talented, and so personable. I will NEVER EVER forget this night. People talk about seeing the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Elvis, etc… but Taylor Swift.. now SHE is the G.O.A.T.!!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Amazed by her performance each time we see her!  Love how much she puts into each and every show and the love for her fans!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Absolutely amazing for everyone, young and old!!  The concert was full of nice people."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,My sister and I had a magical time and so glad we got the opportunity to see TS before the end of her tour!!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I've been to over 100 shows in my lifetime spanning jam bands, classic rock, folk and pop.  I can say without a doubt, the Era's Tour is now in my #1 show spot.  What a show, what an experience. 3.5 hours felt like 1 hour and we still wish it never would have ended! If you ever get the chance to see this show or Taylor next time she tours, GO!!!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"From the VIP boxes we received right before the concert to the very last song - this was an awesome experience. She played 3 1/2 hours straight, the show was magnificent and the vibe in the building couldn’t have been more loving. This was worth every penny and the 5 hour drive!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Absolutely a phenomenal experience!  Even just walking around town was exciting because Swifties create a friendly environment with one another!
The show covered all of Taylor’s albums and the lights, effects and dancing were top notch.  
Massive crowd, massive sound and Taylor herself was never tiring.  She sounded flawless and she’s incredibly professional.  
Just worth every bit!!"
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Unbelieveable show. No one commands the stage and keeps 70k people fully engaged for 3+ hours. Taylor is one of a kind. Never to be duplicated. Outstanding show. Cannot give it enough kudos.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"We were definitely ready for it, the concert of our lives! The night was enchanting from beginning to end. The costumes were gorgeous and the dancers had style. No getaway car was needed because of how awesome the concert was."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,10/10 experience. I was in the 600’s level which was the highest section up and still could see everything. Being able to go through each of Taylor’s different eras was an unforgettable experience. Stadium and merch staff were friendly too.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Eras Tour was the most incredible concert I’ve ever been to. It was an absolute masterpiece. The 3 hours went by way too quickly, and I wish I could relive the feeling daily."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"Even if one doesn't like her music, and I'm not a Swifty by any means as I took my daughter, the show she (and her fellow performers and musicians) put on in Indianapolis was pretty incredible.  There is no denying she is an amazingly talented performer."
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor knows how to put on a show!  I took my daughters to her old tours and now circling back to the Era's tour with them now that they are older is the best feeling in the world!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Taylor really knows how to put on an amazing show!! Wish I could relive it all over again!!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Truly one of the greatest experiences of my life. Our seats were amazing and the whole ticket scan was seamless into the stadium.
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,Indy had everything running so smoothly and definitely were prepared for the Eras Tour. Chills through Taylor’s entire performance! The entire thing was just so magical!
11/4/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I believe there is no bad seat at the Eras Tour, everything is great and there are plenty of tv’s so you can see Taylor better. She is such a sweet and kind human being and makes every show magical. If you have the chance I highly recommend seeing her!"
3/18/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"By far one of the best concert experiences of my life, I'd do anything to go back!! It was a magical, fantastic feeling especially after all my sister and I went through to get the tickets and arrive at the concert. I could not feel more grateful!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2/26/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor was amazing!! The overall Eras Tour from the moment walking into the stadium, seeing the stage for the first time to Gracie's opening act and the production building up the excitement, to finally seeing Taylor was an experience of a lifetime. She really put a lot of hard work and thought into creating a special and memorable experience for her swifties, giving it her all performing from era to era. I would have loved to see her perform Long Live but hopefully she will add that ""permanently""to the setlist on her next upcoming tour! :)"
2/23/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,My first concert ever.Worth the wait from ticket registration via Avion up to the day of the concert.Thank you for the amazing experience.
12/13/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"There really is no better concert to see performed live, it just hits different! The energy really makes sparks fly like your wildest dreams. The Toronto Rogers Centre was a great sized venue where even the nosebleed seats don't make you feel exiled. Long live Taylor Swift, I had the best day. This tour will go down like folklore."
12/12/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was unforgettable and worth every penny. There is a reason that Taylor Swift is the music industry. Would love to relive this experience over and over again.
12/7/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What else can you say but it was Taylor Swift! It was the Eras Tour!!! A night to remember forever! One of the most amazing artists who delivers a show that is amazing to both eyes and ears. It was a night that will never be forgotten 🩷💜
12/5/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor swift put on a spectacular performance!! 10/10 will be attempting to get tickets at any and all future events by her! 🤍❤️🖤
12/4/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I just have to say, that was an amazing concert experience. And I have seen many concerts. Gracie and Taylor put on a spectacular show. The entire crowd, consisting of 50 000 glitter clad, screaming girls was crazy ! And they knew every word to every song. Such a wonderful thing to see. So much happiness in one arena. Worth every penny."
12/4/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,We love it here!!! It was a blast and absolutely amazing! We can’t wait for another concert :P

12/1/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It’s the only website I use for buying tickets. I was fortunate to take my daughter to see Mama Mia for the first time and her idol Taylor Swift this year. She is a big Swiftie. My daughter said it doesn’t get better than this!!   She was over the moon!! Thank you Ticketmaster!!
12/1/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift was fantastic! The arena was electric with high energy and anticipation as the clock ticked down to the opening. I had tears & goose bumps when she appeared to open her show. I watched the fans around me, of all ages, singing along. I watched the lights throughout the audience and stage, and it was incredible how it all worked together, so impressive! The coreography, dancers, singers were great and they looked like they were having fun. 
Most impressive was Taylor's performance! Over 3 hours of, singing, dancing, playing guitar and piano... high energy & emotion throughout. It was an experience I will never forget!"
11/30/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"We were absolutely blown away with the production of this tour! It was easy to find our seats, the staff were absolutely wonderful to deal with and the line ups were managed well by the staff. What can I say about Taylor? The performance was phenomenal and out of this world! My only complaint was that the drinks were VERY expensive! I spent $15 on a popcorn and $74 on TWO drinks!!!! Woah... Other than that the night was amazing!"
11/30/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Once in a lifetime experience. The greatest show I’ve ever seen. Taylor is incredible.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"oh my god. can't even describe how special and amazing that concert was. guys if you have the opportunity to see the last shows of her tour, DO IT! money comes back around but this tour and the memories with it never will.. thank you taylor for everything you've done to make it unforgettable ❤️"
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The effects were crazy and she was so amazing and from whatever seat you were in you could see clearly from the screen.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Eras Tour was an absolutely magnificent experience. It was so much more than just a concert. I had the time of my life trading friendship bracelets, chatting with Swifties, interacting with all of the venue staff, and watching this once-in-a-lifetime performance by the most talented artist. Taylor is so sincere and genuine, and it's obvious that she puts everything she has into putting on the best show for her audience. I've been to many concerts, but I've never been a part of something as special as the Eras Tour. Taylor's band and dancers were incredible. The stage itself was such a marvel. The entire production of this show was remarkable. I feel very lucky to have been able to witness Taylor Swift perform. It had, indeed, been a long time coming, and I'll remember it for the rest of my life...all too well. :)"
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor was AMAZING NO words BEST concert ever!!!   Hats off to Roger’s Centre well organized.  Staff very friendly, on time. Well done Toronto.  Came from Montreal."
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Wow, such an amazing show!!! So glad we had the chance to experience the Eras Tour. It absolutely lived up to the hype. Taylor is an incredible performer… the energy was incredible from start to finish. Gracie was fantastic as well to get things started!"
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Obviously expectations were high for Taylor Swift but the whole event was amazing and met those expectations. Everything was so organized and the staff were very friendly. The only thing I would comment on was that I wish our gate was a little closer to our seats but it wasn’t too far so other than that everything was brilliant.
11/29/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I was able to bring my daughter this time( my second time seeing Taylor on Eras Tour) and it was such an incredible experience to have with her on her 13th birthday. I am a huge Swiftie, but I feel like even if you don’t like her or her music there is no way you could go to one of her concerts and not appreciate what she does on stage and off. She brings people together and it is truly an experience of a lifetime."
11/28/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The most incredible show I’ve ever experienced. I need to go again. She sounded so good and did an amazing job. Still cannot stop thinking about it.
11/28/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"this concert was the best concert I’ve been to and I saw a lot of good pop girlies this year like olivia Rodrigo and tate mcrae, and much more and it was everything thing I needed to be and I miss it so much I love you so much taylor you NEVER disappoint :)"
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I had an Eras Tour ticket transferred from a friend, and the process was incredibly smooth and secure. It showed up in my account instantly, and getting into the venue was seamless."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The best show I have ever seen, in 2024 I saw over 30 artists but Taylor was definitely the most memorable!!!"
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I had the best time seeing Taylor Swift! She is a spectacular performer and the energy in the room was insane. Some of the most happiest moments of my life occurred at Taylor Swift. A truly unforgettable experience!
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What an amazing artist and performance, if you can some how manage to go.. then do it! Be aware that you will become an instant 'Swiftie' after seeing the Eras Tour.

I do wish that Ticketmaster was more regulated and that surge pricing/ and the resales of tickets for 10 times the original price were not able to occur.  This would prevent the hacking and scamming that follows suit.  I was so stressed out about potentially have my tickets hacked from my account.  None of that would have to occur if TM wasn't allowed to inflate the prices and or allow the resellers to do the same."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"One of the best concerts I’ve ever seen! The set design, the music, the dancing, all of it was easily one of the best concerts I’ve ever seen."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was the best concert I’ve ever been to and the best I’ll ever go to. Taylor Swift is the whole package, and I think I’ll be in a post-Eras Tour depression for a very long time."
11/27/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This concert experience was amazing!! Everything was perfect except there was an obstructed view which we were not aware of until we arrived at our seats. But Taylors performance was so amazing!!!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a moment in time! This Taylor Swift show was incredible from the opening act to the last lyrics sung! An unforgettable performance with the highest quality delivery! WOW! When does she return?…
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was amazing, magical!!   So grateful to have the chance to attend!
Something needs to be done about ticketing & resellers.  Two empty seats in front of me for such a high demand event.. Shocking!!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The entire night was amazing! No lines waiting outside to get into the event great flow! When inside the vibe was great! So much happiness in one place! Both Gracie and Taylor put on amazing performances! Taylor sang her heart out for hours and entertained the audience the entire time! Best night, best concert EVER!!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was absolutely amazing. However, I could not see Taylor Swift for more than half of the concert. I was in section 534 and it was not noted as an obstructed view. She and her dancers were often hidden by the tower. It was such a disappointment and I would not have picked these seats had they been identified as an obstructed view."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was a once in a lifetime show! It was amazing. Taylor and her team know how to entertain. Every detail was carefully and thoughtfully planned out.
The venue was good, and everything went smoothly! Cannot recommend this show enough!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a great night I think this concert was even better than the last one I went to on the eras tour . Great stadium!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Awesome event. Made my daughter’ birthday!! Beautiful sets. Amazing choreography. Taylor spent max three minutes to change between eras. That’s some coordination!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Once in a lifetime experience! It was incredible! The performance, the ambiance and everything was excellent!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Great entrance arrangement, easy entry, found seats easily, performance was spectacular, best event I have ever gone too. Liked the interm performances during outfit changes. Taylor did the stage walk (stage was huge with sections that lifted) so everyone got a closer look. Huge screen meant you saw everything even if they were facing the opposite direction. Huge thank you to everyone involved."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The concert was amazing and Taylor is incredible! Gracie was awesome as well. My daughter had the best night of her life
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was such an emotional experience for me! Being in the audience with so many fans and singing my heart out was such an incredible feeling.  TS is such an amazing artist and everything about her stage presence, the choreography with the dancers,  and the stage design is perfectly thought out. I feel so lucky to have been a part of the ERA’s tour experience."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor swift is an amazing performer. i love her. She deserves every award. amazing tour. i felt so safe with security.
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Best concert ever. Venue was super organized and no bathroom lines. Could not ask for a better performance!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I had one of the best nights of my life at The Eras Tour Night 5 at Rogers Centre! Everything ran smoothly, staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Everything was fantastic including the show itself - no other concert will ever come close to this one! Absolutely amazing show put off my Taylor and her team! I wish I could have gone to all 6 nights!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor never disappoints, her concert is nothing short of spectacular. Roger’s Centre did a great job with signage, directing people and were very friendly. I can’t wait to see her again!!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This experience was amazing. Aside from me having major anxiety over getting a presale code/tickets for this concert, everything was amazing! We had the best night and everything was better than I could’ve imagined. So wish I could go again!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor has the BEST concert ever. Ticketmaster needs to figure out their resale problem though because getting tickets was ridiculous
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Amazing. Wonderful. Emotional.
Words aren't enough. It is in the heart and soul."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I have been to two different eras tour shows, if never gets old."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Had an amazing experience!  No issues at all !  Can't wait to go to another concert!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What a great performance by Taylor Swift.  The lights, sounds, pyrotechnics, dancing, imagery and videos.  It was the caliber of show you would expect and won't be disappointed."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I saw the Eras tour in LA and it was amazing. Something about Toronto and the changes to her concert, made this one even better. Can’t believe this tour is about to end, what a ride!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor is personally my favourite singer and has been since I was a kid. She was amazing, everything about that concert was beautiful. Her voice really was magical, and it was legendary. I’m so grateful and lucky I got to go, and I would not trade that day for anything else in this world. Love you Taylor❤️"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"So lovely to be with my daughters and granddaughter in attendance. The concert was timely, organized, secure and safe, no massive line-ups anywhere. It was a wonderful experience."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,One of the best nights of my life. But can you lower ticket prices for all concerts. Like. Dang
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This was the show of the century. We bought obstructed view tickets and ended up being moved closed to the floor. A perfect night. I remember it all too well
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It had been a long time comin….we miraculously got tickets and waited over a year for the concert of a lifetime! It did not disappoint. I went with my mom and two daughters and to say it is a core life memory for all of us, is an understatement! We loved every second! From Gracie opening, to Karma confetti, the entire night was incredible! I’d give anything to go again!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Truly the best experience ever - Taylor Swift puts on a bigger than life show that is worth every penny and then some! If you only go to one concert this decade, the Era’s Tour is the one not to miss! Our whole family enjoyed every moment of the evening and can’t wait to see what’s next for Taylor… 3.5 hours flew by in the blink of an eye!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was the most amazing experience of my life. If you have the chance to see your favorite artist do it! You will never regret it!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I mean come on…it’s Taylor swift. She is the best and she is doing it the best right now. It’s an experience not just a concert. Ticketmaster should have made it easier for more people to get tickets but it was the best I’ve ever been to
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,the best show I have ever seen I’ve been a huge Taylor Swift fan almost my entire life and getting eras tour tickets well it was no small feat it was worth the wait time and effort. Everything in the show was truly amazing and honestly a spectacle ! From the opening to the closing everything was perfectly on point and nothing felt out of place or boring from era to era the show was phenomenal. Even for someone who isn’t a big Taylor fan would still probably love this show ! The energy of the audience was amazing though and through
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was the best night of my lifeee! I would love to go to Vancouver but didn’t get access
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a force to be reckon with. The joy and girlhood that she brings to a place when she comes is truly remarkable. The performance is at a Michael Jackson level of entertainment. The best to do it ever without a doubt.
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The Eras Tour was hands down the best concert I ever went to. She is so generous with her time. Over 3 hours of top notch performances.
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I went to the Eras Tour and had the best time ever! Genuinely had so much fun and I don’t think any seat in the stadium was bad! I was in the nosebleeds and could still see very well! Would definitely go to this concert again!!
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Amazing environment, impeccable sound quality, amazing production. Taylor was flawless. I had the best time!"
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I took my 3 daughter to see thier 1st Taylor Swift concert and her show was AMAZING!  My daughters had the BEST time EVER.  As a parent, seeing how happy they were made my whole night.  She puts on an incredible show.  Highly recommend to all even if you are not a swifty....you will leave with a new level of respect for the artist that she is and the show is very entertaining."
11/26/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Amazing stage presence, had so much fun, Taylor Swift fans are so kind, loved the trading of friendship bracelets. I waited over a year for this concert and it was well worth it. Can’t believe it’s over."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Our family were lucky to get tickets to see Gracie and Taylor in Toronto. What an experience. Core memories made for all of us. Thank you to Taylor, her crew, Gracie, and all of the staff at the Rogers Centre for making this such a memorable night"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"1000% worth the money. This was by far the best concert I have ever been to and went above and beyond my expectations. Every single part of this concert was perfect. Smooth entry into the venue, very helpful staff at the gates and helping seat people. The seats were great. And the concert itself was amazing. Definitely the best night of my life by far."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I went to Toronto N5, and long story short: It was the best night of my life. After years of listening to her music, this was my first time ever seeing Taylor live and I was not disappointed one bit (there was a 0% chance of an ounce of disappointment being in my body anyway). Toronto was totally in the Swiftie spirit and I loved it! It  made me even more excited to get into the stadium. Gracie opened for Taylor and she did AMAZING! My life was changed when I heard the Free Now bridge live. I hope to see Gracie in concert again! When Taylor came on I was full on sobbing. Who wouldn’t be? (Everyone around me…lol). I got to hear some of my childhood favourite songs live like Shake It Off and I Knew You Were Trouble, it was great! Taylor did such an amazing job performing and so did her dancers. I don’t even have words for just how much of an impressive performer she is. She performs for 3+ hours with insanely short breaks, it’s insane. Her stage is amazing, people aren’t lying when they say there isn’t a single bad seat at the Eras Tour. I was in section 527 and I saw EVERYTHING. I saw (and felt) the bad blood flames, the stage visuals, the flashing lights - everything. It was magical. I truly do hope to see Taylor in concert again the next time she decides to tour, I love her."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,TAYLOR SWIFT put on probably the best show I have ever seen in my life! I would be glad to see her again. What a professional entertainer and artist. Amazing song writer that has such a down to earth personality.  A true human being with epic talents!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Truly the BEST concert ever! If I could afford to pay another 3k in resale prices again I’d be going again. Loved every minute of it, so sad it’s over"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Amazing show! Taylor Swift is a class act! This was my 4th time seeing her and it was just as good as the first! Love her!!!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was a wonderful experience from start to finish.  No wait lines to get in to the Rogers Centre, most friendliest people everywhere, Taylor knows how to put on a great show, the girls danced and sang every word of her songs.  Only downfall was the merch line, we stood there for an hour and a half and came home with over sized shirts and hoodies as they didn’t have any small sizes left."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Insane show, 3 hours of amazing work. Taylor was phenomenal ofc but I really really appreciated the work of her dancers as well! Unforgettable experience🫶🏻🩶"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"True artistry, outstanding performance not only by Taylor but also her dancers. Impeccable timing on stage, high energy performance. One of the best nights of my life! Taylor Swift is an extraordinary performer whose talent is in a league of its own. Honoured to be apart of such an historical tour!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I have love Taylor Swift since I was a little kid, I was just 3 years old when her Debut album came out and I was hooked ever since I heard Tear Drops On My Guitar. I am 21 years old now and this was my first Taylor concert. I used to mourn that I never got to go to any of her concerts before but now I get to say I have been able to see every era that I thought I missed. I might sound dramatics but I don’t really care. This concert changed my life and I will remember it forever and ever!!!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Ticketmaster was easy to navigate with lots of communication about merchandise, ticket information, traffic, seating etc. 
Staff at the Roger’s Centre were friendly and eager to help. The queue to get in and merchandise moved quickly without issue. The concert itself was the trip of a lifetime and so worth the wait!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Absolutely incredible! I don’t think another concert will ever top the Eras Tour. The length, sets, vocals, and experience as a whole were one of a kind. My bf described it as a 3.5 hour Super Bowl worthy show because of how intense and amazing it was the whole time. Taylor is an extraordinary performer who truly thinks of every detail."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,A truly incredible concert. Taylor is an incredible artist. The memories we made at the Eras tour will last a lifetime. Seeing my daughter’s eyes light up as her dreams came true was one of the best moments of my life.
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"No bad seats at the Eras Tour. What a performance, honestly felt so safe in the environment surrounded by Swifties. Her voice and theatrics was mind blowing, I couldn’t look away."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The most amazing experience ever. So incredibly grateful that I got to attend this concert. Taylor Swift is a wonderful performer and I wish I could attend this show every night.
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I am extremely fortunate to say this was my third (and final) time seeing the Eras Tour. 

It is magical from the time you arrive at the town it’s being held at to the time the concert is over and everyone is walking out. 

Taylor Swift, the dancers, the band and even the towns she plays in all create the most magical experience for everyone. Whether you’re a life long fan or just joining, whether you’re in the 500s or on the floor, you’ll have the absolute time of your life. 

Thank you all!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was an asolutely breathtaking and amazing performance. Taylor killed it, her dancers killed it, her backup singers killed it, her band killed it, and the sound/tech crew killed it. Everyone involved killed it. I cried. Such a fun show and a fun environment. Everyone I traded bracelets with was lovely. The merch crew and concession sellers were so kind. The city itself did an excellent job (way to go Tayronto). Everything about this show blew me away and I loved it. Sucks that Ticketmaster handled the sale horribly, but luckily I was chosen. I hope all Canadian Swifties that didn't get to go to the Eras Tour get to go to her next tour."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Everything about this show was magical! From the moment we purchased tickets until the moment we left the Rogers Centre, everything went smoothly! It was stressful getting tickets in the first place because it was like winning the lottery to even get a pre-sale code but, once we had the tickets, we patiently waited over a year until it was time and WOW was it ever worth it! I would have waited a lifetime if I knew I’d get to see a show of that calibre. The whole production was seamless and, if there were any technical difficulties, we certainly couldn’t tell. Taylor Swift and her whole crew are total rockstars and work so professionally - we wouldn’t have been able to tell of anything went “wrong” because they perform with such strength and confidence, making everything look effortless! Every aspect of the show was captivating — her vocal performance and stage presence, their choreography, the stage set up and effects, the lighting/light show — even getting in and out of the Rogers Centre was a breeze! We were blown away by the bracelets given to every attendee that were somehow programmed to turn on a different points, in different rhythms and with various colours. The food and drinks available to purchase were a bit overpriced but delicious, and the price is to be expected at a stadium. The merchandise was cleverly set up in various sections of the building and, although lots of items were sold out, it was arranged in a way that ensured fans could at least see if there was anything they’d like to stand in line to get a chance to purchase. We had the time of our lives at this concert and don’t think anything will ever top it!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor put on an absolutely amazing performance. Every aspect of the show was incredible! Wish I could experience this all over again! Best experience of my life!!!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor was out of this world! What a superstar and what a performance!  Gracie rocked it! The Roger’s Centre was awesome and made it so easy to navigate and get in.  Experience of a lifetime ❤️
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Attended the Friday 5th Eras show in Toronto at Rogers Centre. The show was amazing, Taylor was amazing as always (I’ve seen her 3x now). It was everything I was expecting and more. 
My only regret to say is I was sad about the merch lines. 2hr wait at 5pm and the show started at 6:45. Sadly I did not get anything."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Top five days of my life this was the best concert I’ve ever been to the spectacular technology, the energy of the performers, the friendliness of the crowd just made for the perfect night"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The stress of getting codes, the 470 day wait from tickets purchased to show, flights, accommodation…seeing The Eras Tour was everything I could have imagined and more. What a show! What a performance!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,We tremendously enjoyed the concert. Worth every dollar I spent. My daughter’s 1st concert was very memorable as she adores Taylor Swift.
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The best and most thought out concert i have ever been to. Truly a magical experience and i am so blessed to have been able to attend. Thank you Taylor!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Great experience. Very well organized.  City did a great job guiding fans in the stadium and outside the arena to public transit. Felt safe.  Only complaint was the line up for the bathrooms
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This show was genuinely life-changing. It is incredible how she can perform, sing, and dance for 3+ hours -- i got tired just standing there! Her energy, the crowd, the songs, I could not have asked for a better show. The best night ever."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Toronto night 5 Simply outstanding performance.  I have watched the movie many times, but being there in Rogers Center with Taylor and the production staff was something I will never forget. Out of all 75 concerts I have been to. This one is was the Best.  So glad my daughter suggested us to go.  Thank you Taylor for that amazing Experience"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I attended Taylor Swift The Eras Tour night 5 in Toronto. It was absolutely amazing. Hands down the best concert I have ever had the opportunity to attend. Loved every minute of it. Being surrounded by so much positivity and kindness was unbelievable. Taylor Swift embodies that!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Nothing short of an amazing performance! Crowd “sparkled” with excitement, enthusiasm and happiness!💕
Taylor played non stop for over three hours! Everyone left with a heart filled with joy! Thanks for the once in a lifetime experience with a kind and thoughtful artist! The one and only Taylor “Sweetheart” Swift!💕💕💕"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift put on the performance of a lifetime. She was absolutely incredible. The production was amazing, the stage changes, the background dancers, the costume changes, everything was executed to perfection. Congrats to Taylor, she gave me an experience I will never forget. I couldn’t stop smiling the entire time."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Perfection from start to finish. Never have I ever been in a more kind, welcoming and warm space. And goodness knows, we need that right about now."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Great experience - start to finish ordering tickets to claim to enter the Rogers Arena. The city was ready for the Eras tour and it was a fun environment—a great venue to see a concert. TAYRONTO was fantastic!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was an excellent production from start to finish. Easy to access tickets, entering and leaving the venue. Taylor put on a fantastic show. Well worth it, we are glad we didn’t sell our tickets. 😀
A concert to remember for sure."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor Swift puts on an amazing concert. She doesnt stop and her costume changes are so quick. Her back up dancers are very talented dancers. I was in awe. This 3.5 hour concert went by so fast and when it was over i was actually sad and immediately wanted to watch it again. I can completely understand why these girls and young women are becoming SWIFTIES.  I am 55 and a new SWIFTIE! THANK YOU TAYLOR SWIFT 💓
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Not only am I the best Mom in the world for securing tickets, but I am now apart of the sisterhood of Swifties. Taylor is probably the greatest show-woman I have ever seen in concert. This was my daughters first concert and she still hasn't come down from the high of the night. GREATEST NIGHT EVER!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was a night to remember. I’m so lucky to have been able to attend. Many fans wanted to attend and couldn’t. 
From the sets to Taylor’s showmanship it was as good as it gets. 
I hope it’s not too long before she tours again."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Great performance by Taylor! Magical production experience, overall a once in lifetime experience!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Not kidding when I say it was the best night of my life. The community, the friendship bracelet trading, the pure unadulterated joy. She’s created something so precious and so magical."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The best concert I’ve ever had. It feels like dream come true. Still not believe I just met Taylor for real. ILOVEUTAY!!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Best memories made with my daughter! The seats were amazing, couldn’t have asked for a better night."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This experience was everything that we needed after going through the pandemic and I always wanted to see her in concert and now I have for the first time I will always remember this moment for the rest of my whole life🥹🥲 my fave moment was singing my favourite songs from different eras such as red and folklore and the new album too was so amazing and I enjoyed the ending to the show too 🩷 i am gonna be honest waiting for a year for her to come to Toronto was the best wait ever and it was so worth it 🫶🏻❤️✨
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,What a fantastic show! So happy we were finally able to score face value tickets and go to the show. She performed for 3.5 hrs and was spectacular! I wish more people had the chance to get tickets to go.
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I had sky high expectations for this concert and it crushed them. Taylor Swift is absolutely incredible. It was not a cheap night but worth every penny and the memories I made with my wife and daughters. We all had a marvelous time…
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,She is amazing and genuinely the best performer I have ever seen. I can’t believe this tour is almost over 😭😭
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What a show. Taylor brought it as always, amazing show and energy for 3.5 hours. Gracie Abrams was so good as well, a surprise. She was a delight. The crowd was absolutely incredible. So much energy, everyone was so nice and everyone was engaged and locked in on every song. The standing ovation was the loudest and longest I’ve ever heard. I think even Taylor was taken back. Toronto was a great experience and N5 was one of the best shows I’ve ever been to….this dad was a hero to an amazing 11 yo daughter o this night and she had the time of her life. Thank you Taylor (and Gracie) and thank you Toronto!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This concert was the best thing that ever happened, Taylor but on such a great show!"
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Eras Tour was absolutely incredible! Every aspect of it was the most magical experience! From showing up to the giant friendship bracelet on the building, exchanging friendship bracelets, and getting themed snacks to the performance. The show - there are no words! You can tell the work that everyone involved put in to make it the most amazing show ever! The light-up bracelets  and shouting lyrics brought the whole stadium together where it felt like 49,000 people were just one giant community. Large events in a city also have the potential for safety concerns but I felt 100% safe the whole time."
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The Eras tour was so amazing and so so great! The whole atmosphere was electric and including the light up bracelets really was a fun touch and seeing them all light up in sync was incredible! Great show and I hope Vancouver enjoys the final 3 shows they won’t be disappointed!
11/25/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I can’t believe I finally got to the Eras Tour. It exceeded my very high expectations. We do not deserve Taylor and her music.
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"An incredible experience! Was very impressed by the preparedness of the city for this event, Roger’s was super organized and everyone was so friendly! Was incredible to be able to attend! Taylor, as always was amazing! Especially loved the themed drinks with friendship bracelets and specially named food items that Roger’s offered, so much fun ☺️"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Taylor Swift concert November 21/24 was the best concert of my life. Tremendously talented Taylor Swift put on an Amazing show. It was the experience of a lifetime.  My 13 year old daughter was overjoyed with the concert as well.
Thank you to everyone involved with this event."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Incredible! Worth the wait since I bought tickets Aug 2023! Sad to see the Eras your end (:
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,It was an Epic event of the lifetime. Great organization of the event. Seamless coordination. Kudos to all.
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The show itself was AMAZING, no complaints regarding the performance Taylor put on. However, my friends and I bought the Karma is Boyfriend package and disappointed for the price is an understatement. As we travelled to the show from another province we felt the that the originally promised perks of crowdless merch lines and early entry into the stadium was worth it to ensure we got the merchandise we wanted.  However, come show day we did not receive any of the perks for vip tickets that were promised to be apart of the package at the time we purchased the tickets, nor were we informed of this change to the package OR refunded for removing these perks. We found out through research that these perks were actually no longer part of the package a week before our show. With the chaos of Toronto and early merch days we attempted to try and get merch early to guarantee we got what we wanted, however, this was not the case despite lining up early. We attempted the merch line 3 different days and still did not get the correct sizes we wanted as they had sold out within minutes. Part of this problem was the fact that there was no limit on how many items people could buy, so we saw multiple people walk out with multiples of the highly coveted blue crew necks and grey quarter zips. Another issue we encountered was the lack of organization when it came to entry into the stadium. We asked multiple workers where we should be standing in line and they had no clue and pointed us in a general direction. With this disorganized entry into the stadium, we ended up standing the wrong line for approximately an hour. As for the vip box that was supposed to be shipped to our house before the show did not arrive until after our show date I cannot speak to the quality of the merch in those boxes but can say that with the removed perks on show day in general the VIP karma is my boyfriend package was a waste of money and not worth it. Just another way to take advantage of and up charge swifties who want to see to see their favourite artist in person."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,it was great i cried she sounded so good im sad it’s ending and im sad i wont be there for the rest of it I LOVE U TAYLOR
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"There is no better show than Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. Over 3 hours of pure entertainment fueled by Taylor’s unparalleled talent that made me feel every possible emotion in a giant arena full of (mostly) women and girls that somehow felt like a giant collective hug. I don’t know that I’ll ever feel as safe, as carefree, or as hopeful as I felt in that space for that short but brilliant moment in time. I’m so glad and thankful to have had the opportunity and privilege to experience this epic masterpiece."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I have the best time as a fan of Taylor, 15 years waiting for it, worth it every single second. I got the code and bought a ticket on 515 section, row 16, the thing that I didn’t expected was to have a obstructed view and was NEVER said nothing about, besides, I paid a ticket price of a not obstructed view. The light/power tower as exactly in the middle of the diamond, so when Taylor was in the Center of the stage as impossible to see her. 
I just wanted to know before buy it and paid and price for a obstructed view, but the rest was 10/10. Is Taylor, she always do her best."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Where do i even start? From beginning to end Taylor Swift puts on a show! Even though we had seats we were on our feet the whole 3 hours! 🫶🏼
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"From the very start when the lights when down and the crowd erupted, I knew I would be part of something big. Thank you Taylor, for creating this experience."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was incredible, we had an amazing time!!! And the workers were all so so so nice!!! It was the best night EVER!!!! TAYLOR SWIFT WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Enchanting. Life changing. The eras tour is a night I will never forget. It was rare and I was there!! Ticketmaster needs to make the process easier for fans. I was one of the lucky few who won the Great War, but so many Canadian fans missed out. The prices were insane- especially the resale prices. Do better next time ticket master!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Lovers and haters can’t deny Taylor is a superstar! Kept the audience of 40000 people entertained for 3.5 with surprises songs and even a surprise light up wrist band! Wardrobe changes, set changes oh my!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The show was great, but the seats are incredibly tiny, with no room for a tall person legs. Only terrible beer options for premium prices."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"While I was getting concerned with the growing amount of emails from Ticketmaster regarding the Toronto performance of Taylor Swift, I was incredibly impressed with the organization of the ENTIRE event.  I did not stand in line (though I didn't dare to for merchandise), and all of the security members and volunteers were extremely helpful and nice (a nice change).  I was impressed at the level of local businesses who made and traded bracelets, and how easy it was through the process of getting to our seats.
I was not impressed however at the small drink (Cutwater can of Tequila/Soda).  3 drinks for 3 of us was $76.  That is over $25 each for a $3 LCBO small can.  That was an extreme overcharge, and because they open it immediately, you can't decline it!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Seeing Taylor on this tour has been the most spectacular, amazing thing that my daughter and I got to share together."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was an amazing concert, best experience I’ve had in my life. I was lucky to win the Great War and got tickets at face value."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The most memorable concert ever! And so thankful to share this experience with my girls. Thank you Taylor Swift for creating such an amazing concert for all to truly enjoy! We are all still sparkling!!!
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Words cannot describe how amazing this show was. Taylor Swift puts on an INCREDIBLE show! The lights, the sets, the music, the dancing, every part of the show was amazing. It was more than 5 stars but that is the maximum I can give. It was 100000000+ stars and I would 100% recommend to anyone to go to her shows. Even those who are not Swifties will enjoy as she is an incredible entertainer! 
Swifties are lovely and friendly and open. You will see amazing outfits, glitter and probably end up with a friendship bracelet! :)"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"There are absolutely no words to describe how perfect my night was. I’m so grateful I was able to experience the Eras Tour. Moments like this only happens once every few lifetimes🫶🏼 TS, I LOVE YOU!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Such a beautiful performance gorgeous outfits, the sets were so cool and we all got bracelets that lit up in a heart in the crowd for lover"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"So so good! Went by so fast - best concert ever! Acoustics great and view even from the 500,s was geeat"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I’ve seen Taylor a few times, but nothing can compare to the Eras Tour experience. Pure love, joy, and enthusiasm for 3.5 hours."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,She is definitely a great artist who knows how to do her craft really well. Superb performance! Totally worth it.
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I don’t know how she does that for 3 hours straight. She’s Wonder Woman. Thank you Taylor for an unforgettable night!!!
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I had an absolutely amazing time attending The Eras Tour in Toronto. Taylor was absolutely incredible and this concert is the show of a lifetime!!!
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Everything went so smoothly from getting to he venue on the Go , getting in the Roger’s Center to our seats was easy! The show was the best I have ever seen! I love Taylor Swift!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,She played for 3 1/2 hours. You can feel all the love in the stadium. Just incredible!
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert itself was hands down one of the best productions I’ve ever seen. The attention to detail and end product was extremely impressive. 
However the system to acquire the tickets was a hassle and that hassle has transferred to every ticketmaster show I’ve attended. Someone must be done regarding the resale market and dynamic pricing must be abolished. Its taking away the ability for the everyday fan to attend and enjoy their favorite artists, and reflects on the selfishness and greed of Ticketmaster and the artists that allow this to happen."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The best concert i have been to. The total vibe, the light show, the entire production was phenomenal.  Can't wait for the next."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was a fantastic display of high quality music, dance, theatrical performance! This coupled with visual effects, light, sound and fireworks made it more memorable. Taylor was at her best with high energy display of her talent! Gracie was great too at the opener."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift rocked that stage for a solid 3 1/2 hrs!! My daughter, sister and I danced and sang all night, amazing memory making concert 🫶❤️"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The show was absolutely AMAZING! Loved every second of it!!! Would have gone to every single show she had in Toronto if I could have!!! I have seen her 2 other times during her past tours and always had a great time! 
Presale merch was a bit of a mess with the amount of resellers and the no limits on purchases until the second last day. Resellers were buying hot items and selling for 2-3 times the price causing the venue to run out of hot items within 10 min of opening, while true fans had waited in lines for hours.   
 However, the ticketmaster war and resale of tickets was outrageous and poorly done!! Very disappointed in the mess that was!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I understand the hype! From the moment she took the stage to her last song of the night, Taylor was on point. The energy of the crowd, the lights and the effects, created an experience that's hard to even put into words. My daughter and I loved every minute"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What an amazing show! I'd watch it every night if I could. I just wish that it's easier for fans to access the tickets. However, all the effort was worth it. I've never been that happy in my life and I've never screamed that much! What a magical, sparkly, and enchanting night!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This was by far the best concert I have been to in a long time!  I took my 9 yr old son for his birthday and he said that was the best moment in his life!  Thank you Taylor for giving us the best memories!
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Epic show, merch lines were completely ridiculous and you were left with nothing but not sure how to avoid that. Food and drink prices way too high, $10 for a bottle of water, that’s robbery, can’t even afford to stay hydrated."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Eras Tour is the BEST concert of all time. Taylor has set the bar high and I don't think anybody can do what she does. I became a fan because of my husband, and I totally get it now how crazy swifties are over her. You get the best value for your buck for this concert. This was my 4th show and the last. I hope she doesn't wait too long to have another concert."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Show was marvelous! You certainly get your moneys worth. 3 hr 45 minutes.
Artistry and lighting was wonderful! Made the show all that much better. 10/10 experience. Venue wasn't great. Way too crowded which made it very uncomfortable. Seats were way too small. Halls selling merchandise and drinks/food was overrun with people. Long, long line to use the facilities. Should have been held at larger venue."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Era’s Tour in Toronto was epic.  Taylor Swift is an amazing song writer, singer and performer.  The atmosphere at the concert was like no other.  It was so worth waiting for. My daughter had the time of her life!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,She’s so beautiful up close. I’ll be back a million times. She’s is an amazing performer and just idk if I’ll ever I have a better experience than this one! I hope she never stops tour so I can see her every single year
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,To say I got to be at an Eras Tour show will be one of my greatest memories to share. Experiencing this with my daughter is something we will both cherish forever. Taylor you are AMAZING!
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Best concert. Didn’t even feel like 3.5hrs. She is amazing. You’d think she could go on for 6hrs the energy she has. So captivating.
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Amazing!! Just Amazing!! Although, I bought resale..wasn’t one of the lucky verified fans that got a code.  Been trying for 2 years to get reasonably priced tickets or even access to buy tickets. Ticketmaster you have to do better. Your verified fan system is not working."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was an amazing show, the performance was amazing, the environment was great and we really enjoyed!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Eras tour in Toronto was world class. The communication on which gate we were to go to, what corner of the stadium the gate was located at, how to scan your ticket was excellent. The police presence to handle the crowds and block roads made it very efficient to navigate our way to the event from public transport. The concert of course… was amazing!!!! Well done Toronto!"
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert experience was everything we wanted, and the set up and organizing at the Roger’s Centre made it possible to enjoy it without any hassle."
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This concert was absolutely amazing! She performed like it was night one with the same energy and stamina! We were amazed! I wouldn’t change a thing if I could.
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This concert was the best experience I’ve ever had. The only down fall was them running out of merch that was only sold at the concert. Super disappointing.
11/24/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I will never be able to forget the night I had!!! Taylor Allison Swift, thank you for your music and for all you do to bring joy to our lives!!! This concert was everything I imagined and more!!!! I will be reliving this night for the rest of my life!!!"
11/22/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This was more than just a concert it was a full Taylor Swift experience. It was the best and most magical day of my entire life and I feel so lucky to have been able to go. I will hold onto the memories from this day for the rest of my life. Seeing my favourite singer and role model who I have been a fan of since I was 5 singing picture to burn was a full circle moment and nothing will ever compare. It was a bonding experience with my three sisters that I will cherish forever. Thank you Taylor for everything 🫶🏻
11/22/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift was absolutely incredible. She played 45 songs, 3.5 hours of pure joy🫶"
11/22/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"First of all, this was my first concert experience outside my home country. And Ive to say it was a delightful experience which was not due to Taylor but the love and charm spread by swifties. I am not a Else, musicwise the listening experience wasn’t the same as what you listen on her videos or spotify. Her voice was kinda male dominated at times but the background singers and dancers makes it all at a different level. My seat was on ground floor, so couldn’t see the stage and bridge light effects, but it was worth it since I could see Taylor from nearby. No matter where you sit, you’ll always be able to see the screen . Having said that, I am not a huge swiftie who knows all of her songs, so was not being able to get along in whole concert. Maybe that’s why i’ve given 4 stars. But definitely was a mind blowing experience! Management of event was good, staff was welcoming.Security measures could be improved."
11/21/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Was a great show my wife and daughter loved it I’m more into heavier music I was wowed on the show she put on I would definitely do it again and special thanks to the dancer who interacted with my daughter at the end of the show you made her night
11/21/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was such a wonderful and memorable concert! Taylor Swift was amazing! Taylor Swift and Gracie Abrams are both such great live singers and performers! The line-up was also quick and efficient considering the major crowd of people at the concert. Overall, it was a great event - thank you to everyone who made it happen!"
11/21/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I was ready for it. It's been a long time coming! I counted days, I counted miles, to see her there. It was rare I was there I remember it all too well. I don't know how it gets better than this! This night was sparkling and flawless! Taylor was the loudest woman this city had ever see, and the crowds went wild! This happens once every few lifetimes so in this moment now, capture it, remember it, hold on to the memories they will hold on to you. Confetti falls to the ground may these memories break our fall, there's glitter on the floor after the party, I had the time of my life with Taylor and Gracie!"
11/20/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor swift was amazing there was so much dancing and screaming everything about it was perfect I loved the set up and the songs. Gracie Abram’s was amazing. Sounds so much better in person. Both of them do .
11/20/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Everything about the concert was perfect! Taylor knows how to put on a good show!!
11/20/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"It was a DREAM COME TRUE to see Taylor Swift in person. I had the night of my life singing my heart out to all of her songs. I took one star away only because of the insane food prices and the disorganization of the merch lines. Other than those, I had the best night of my life at the Eras Tour."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The best production you will see. Taylor and her crew take you on a journey through the eras. It is beautiful and fun to watch, sing a long, and enjoy an evening with 60000+ other fans."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The Taylor Swift Toronto Concert was incredible. Taylor, the Dancers, the Band, staging, the video displays, and atmosphere were indescribable out of this world! My first Taylor Swift concert and I will be a Swiftee forever!"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Worth every penny! She knows how to put on a show! Swifty forever!
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor puts on a hell of a show. Just be prepared to pay. Got tickets from tickets master. Expensive but i suppose the #1 selling artist on earth is going to be. Merch was expensive and drinks/snacks at the venue were brutal expensive. 

Shows are becoming out of reach for most people. As a Swifty dad I don't understand how most people can afford prices like this. 

But again she puts out a world class show and people throw money to see it, so good for her."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Amazing? Electric? Life changing? The Eras Tour truly cannot be described in words. It is an experience like no other.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was my first time ever seeing Taylor live and it was absolutely incredible! The concert was a masterpiece and I can’t believe I was lucky enough to be there.
One of the things I was looking forward to most was the light up bracelet experience however that was sadly the worst experience I had. The bracelet did not work for the first three albums and then was off and on for the remainder of the concert. I can’t even begin to describe how lonely it was to be what felt like the only one in a crowd of 50,000 people being excluded from the full experience. It may sound crazy but it was extremely upsetting and made it difficult to fully appreciate the concert. 
I understand that things are not always reliable so maybe in the future there can be a way to check if the lights work prior to the start of the show so that I could have asked for a new one before Taylor came on."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,After waiting 18 months to hear Taylor sing it was everything that we hoped it would be! Taylor sang for three hours straight to a sold out crowd. Everyone was so nice and the Rogers Center was so organized getting everyone into and out of the venue. I had an amazing time and can not say enough good things about the experience!
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Best concert I’ve ever been to. Hands down. It was surreal - but spectacular at the same time. Love! 💕
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Truly a once and a lifetime experience. The concert was amazing, best one I’ve seen"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"If you can go, go. I actually cried. What a magical experience. So many emotions in one night and the crowd was incredible."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was by far the most exciting venue I have ever went to . The stage was amazing, how it was all movable led screens. Taylor was amazing .lm still in awe. Toronto went above and beyond to make you feel safe in there fine city. Go train was great way to get there as there was extra trains and no overcrowding.Rodgers was great in helping me to my seat as I was having mobility issues. Best night ever !"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I would have given this show 5/5 because Taylor was awesome. But we had obstructed tickets thanks to 1 of the 4 large light/sound/pyrotechnic towers built around the stage. Every time Taylor went to the middle portion of the stage, which raised and lowered, (which was a lot) my wife and I couldn’t see at all. This especially sucks considering the price of the “VIP” tickets."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,The best concert of my life. Phenomenal ins the only word that comes close to describing it.  Getting tickets was an absolute nightmare though…
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"A fun experience. Great stage effects, dancing and performance. The venue was perfect. 

Felt like a lot of the songs were lip-synced but enjoyed them nonetheless."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"What an amazing show. Loved every moment of it. The lights, sound, dance, singing, wow wow wow. Food and drink options wonderful. Bathroom lines not that bad considering the amount of people at N2 of  Taylor Swift. Merch lines were too long, not enough inventory of styles or sizes. Disappointed no water bottles being sold during concert. Then when I managed to get back in line from floor level non left.  Floor seats were okay but so many people wearing hats and taller than me couldn't see too much."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,We had the best night ever !  If it wasn’t so hard to get tickets I would attend the Eras tour again in a heartbeat .
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was absolutely incredible. Loved the show from beginning to end. Such an awe inspiring performance from Taylor as well as her dancers, band and back up vocalists. 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,freaking  awesome ， the most exciting night and the most wonderful concert ever
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"this was the most magnificent thing i've ever seen. a spectacle of a show. the songs, the choreography, the visuals, the atmosphere, everything. obviously ms taylor swift could never disappoint. i cried for almost 3 hours straight. 10/10"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift the eras tour in an incredible concert but also an incredible experience!!! Almost everyone there was supper nice and the energy was out of this world with excitement!!! In addition, seeing Taylor Swiftb live was magical!!! My mom an I sat in section 22 and the view was amazing as she was quite close! I was able to get tickets for Nov 16, and got them at ticketmasters first ticketdrop on the Monday before. One thing I would HIGHLY recommend are high quality concert designed ear plugs. Although it sounds counterintuitive, it is the reason I was able to hear Taylor clearly over the cheering and just because of how loud it is. Those saved my ears from ringing. All in all the concert was for sure an unforgettable experience!"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift is a fantastic singer, it was a great show The way she continued to have no intermission and sing all the way through was absolutely amazing. But I do feel that the hype of everyone going absolutely crazy with Merch and lining up for 7hours is crazy to me.  I feel having a  3 1/2 hours concert was way too long of a show. It would’ve been much better if it stopped around 2 1/2 to 3 hours. I would definitely recommend someone going to see the show but not for thousands of dollars."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"everything was perfect, but when we got to our seats (section 517) there was a speaker blocking the screen right in the center so we couldn’t see what’s going on clearly :( other than that everyone was super nice! The show was incredible"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Seeing Taylor live is an unparalleled experience! It was a wonderful night. The production of her show is such high quality!
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"One of the best concerts I have attended. Her energy, love for her fans and her band, singers and dancers is amazing and over the top!! She never slows down and makes everyone feel like she is singing just to them."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Truly blessed to be able to experience such an amazing show! I couldn’t have asked for a smoother experience. The swiftie community coming together to have a great time was incredible to watch!
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I wanna first say I am grateful that I got to experience the show and Taylor put on such a good performance. However as someone that paid for VIP tickets I didn't get any perks. There was no early entry, no VIP merch tables, our seats had the tower in our way at the end of the stage and had a wire right in the middle of our view. What was the point of paying an extra $800? Many people paid $90 for their tickets and got upgraded to our section for free. We weren't able to get any merch because by the time that we got to the front they were completely sold out of everything. I wouldn't have waited in line that long if people told us what was sold out. 

The actual show was amazing but I truly wish we coulda got what we specifically paid for."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor put on an amazing experience for all. The lights, the music, and the atmosphere was beyond thrilling and electric. This concert will be remembered for all time and we were all thrilled to be part of the Eras Tour!"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,She put on the best show! The entire experience was amazing. I’ve loved her since I was nine years old and being able to see her again in Toronto was awesome
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I was 13th row - which actually ended up being 3rd off the side tip of the diamond. I was so excited. While purchasing the tickets were rough, everything else was perfect. Staff at the venue were super helpful and it seemed very organized. Prices for drinks were absolutely ridiculous. $15 for a fountain drink? Really?

Gracie Abrams was a great opener who got the crowd hyped!

And then the Main Event. Taylor Swift lit up the stage for 3.5 hours and took us through a journey of her entire career. She was perfection. Fun, energetic, and just magical. If you can go - GO!! Not to be missed!! I can't stress that enough. The vibe of the crowd was immaculate. Swifties are awesome. A+++++++++..."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Phenomenal Taylor Swift performance, stage prop’s unique, no rain worries (Roger’s Centre roof best added detail being in place). Taylor special drinks tasty with a friendship bracelet ❣️Well organized entry into the venue. Sound in the Roger’s Centre was PERFECT., indeed was amazed and surprised at hot hot PYROTECHNICS experience (first time ever had this at a Taylor concert) in an enclosed stadium. Well worth the drive from NY to beautiful Toronto Canada ❤️ 🇨🇦 ❣️😎"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Tickets were so hard to come by , I think Ticketmaster should revisit their system on how to get tickets into the hands of fans instead of scalpers. There were some empty seats. As per the show TAYLOR SWIFT IS AMAZING! Best concert I’ve ever been too!!"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Was an incredible concert and she was amazing!!!!!!! Only complaint is that the speaker tower directly block our view of center stage so we could not see her anytime she was on the lifting platforms which was disappointing.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,100/10 rating for this day!!’ Such and amazing concert and nothing else will ever compare.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Words is not enough to express the happiness I’ve experience seeing Taylor Swift in the Stage. I was grateful that ticket master gave me the opportunity to purchase the ticket and I was able to attend Night 3 toronto  Last November 16,2024 with my best friend Krissta. It was the best day of our life attending the Era’s Tour. I’ve waited this half of my life it was a dream come true. Healing my inner child. Hope to see more of Taylor in the near future. For now I will keep that memories and experience in my heart."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,There were no issues getting in to the stadium with tickets in my wallet. There are discrepancies on how additional tickets are being released to people who have not signed up for presale. People who have signed up are not being allowed to acquire tickets while others who are only purchasing to resell for profit are getting in without a problem. This needs to be rectified for future shows regardless of the artist.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Everything was amazing besides the long lines for merch(given the artist it was understandable) however after waiting almost 3 hours, almost all of the merch was sold out but there were people who had purchased multiple pieces of the same item preventing others from being able to buy merchandise"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,This was one of the best nights of my life. It was so magical and surreal. I am sad that it is over!!
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"as a longtime fan of taylor, I have to say she is just an incredible performer and she’s gotten better every time I’ve seen her (her first show I saw was the Speak Now Tour) Can’t wait until the next tour!"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,My daughter took me to Taylor Swift and it was unlike anything I’ve seen. Such an entertainer and experience. Totally worth it.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"My daughter is the Swiftie. I went along for the ride. She was blessed to land tickets and I like Swift's music, but now I can say that I am truly a fan, part of the Swiftie club. Taylor commanded the stage in Toronto - a woman completely owning her craft and her personal power. She made the entire crowd feel welcome and connected and 3.25 hours later, we were all sated and running on an endorphin high. Great show, great venue, great experience."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I've dreamed of seeing Taylor Swift for so long and it was worth every penny to make that dream come true
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This concert was a once in a lifetime experience. I knew it would be great, but to say my expectations were met would be an understatement. The level of production that went in to this shows, everything went flawlessly. I hope the production crew feels a huge sense of pride from their work. The back up singers and band also deserve a huge amount of praise as well, they kept up with Taylors energy and brought such a wonderful performance. 

Gracie Abrams also brought her A game as she hyped up the crowd with her opening performance. She was absolutely amazing as well. 

And of course Taylor Swift blew it out of the water. I can't believe she has been doing this for so long and the level of energy she brings is outstanding. She managed to bring out the crowds energy as even after the performance the energy was still next level. I can easily say without a doubt in my mind that this is the best concert I have ever been to in my life, and will probably continue to be (Until we get a second eras tour in a few years, lol). 

In terms of the food and drink I expected the expensive stadium food prices but honestly they could have charged way more. The mocktails were expensive and hard to track down, but were really delicious, my only criticism would be having more for different eras as they were really good and I want more. 

Overall this is an experience I will never forget, I am sad it is over, but so happy it happened. Still a few days after I am still buzzing from the experience. I hope Taylor has a good long rest after the last show as she more than deserves it."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"We arrived early got in early we went and bought our merchandise . Everything went very smoothly . The concert set up was very good ,  excellent sound and video . We thoroughly enjoyed the concert . The organizers at the Rogers Centre were great it was a well run show. We had the best time."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,One of the best concerts I have ever been to. Beyond worth the travel and the money spent. A once in a lifetime opportunity.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I recently went to the Taylor Swift Toronto show at Rogers Centre, night 3 on Saturday November 16, 2024. The gate that I was designated to enter was empty with no lines so we were into the Rogers Centre within maybe 2 minutes then at our seats within 10 minutes. The gate was easy to access as well as locate. There were lots of staff with indicative signs for the Taylor Swift concert so no one got lost on their way. Also, the facility was proactive knowing that Taylor Swift has more female fans compared to male, and converted men's washrooms into women's washrooms so the lines to wait were not as long which was very nice and considerate. Overall, well-organized and easy to get in and out of the facility."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The best organization, thank you tkmaster. A girl from Venezuela was able to see her fav artist😍"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This concert, or should I say production, is mind blowing! I’ve been a swiftie since her debut album, and being in attendance of all the eras was nothing short of phenomenal!"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"First, I'm a Swifty who is in her 70's, and my birthday present was to attend the Toronto concert. It was by far the BEST concert I've ever been to, and I've been to MANY in my 70+ years. The seats were fantastic, but VERY expensive. Worth it for what it was. She is almost finished with the Eras Tour. If you have an opportunity to see it, definitely do so!"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"We cried happy tears , we danced and we sang for the entire show ! Taylor put on an amazing show and I will remember this forever !"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Absolutely out of this world! A surreal experience!! Must see performance! Taylor Swift is simply the best.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Magical doesn’t even begin to describe this show. I have seen the movie many times, watched 88 grainy live streams and nothing could have prepared me to see it in person. The atmosphere was electric and pure joy the whole weekend from when we arrived Friday to leaving Sunday after our show on Saturday. Thank you Taylor. You are an absolute gift to the world."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Great night! I took my 8 year old daughter to her first concert and seeing her experience the Eras tour was amazing!!
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"While i have been getting tickets from Ticketmaster for many many years, the experience with the Taylor Swift tickets was by far the best and I applaud the company for making such an effort to clarify and inform people before the concert with updates and information. I felt very confident going into the potential chaos that such a big show can invite."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor truly puts on the best concert and she really thinks of all the details. You could see her on stage no matter how far you were because her costumes sparkled. The screens were amazing. The stage was insane. Her band was awesome and interacted with the audience who had restricted views. Literally the best concert ever. Such a vibe.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift! What else do you need to know? She performed for well over 2 hours. Went seamlessly from era to era. Sang her heart out, connected with the crowd and exuded positive vibes for everyone."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Best time ever.   Took my daughter/daughter in laws and granddaughters. Three generations.   A lifetime memory.  We all couldn’t wipe the smiles off our faces.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"This was the greatest show I’ve seen. There was a lot of pure joy and energy in the stadium. My only complaints are that there should be quantity limits on items sold at merch so that people don’t buy out an entire item while everyone waits in hours long lines. Similarly, there were some children misbehaving (jumping down the stairs in the aisles, climbing on the handrails) that a staff had a hard time controlling. Other than that, it was perfect"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Easily the best concert I have ever been to. I have loved Taylor for 18 years since release of Debut. I am an obsessed swiftie to say the least, seeing her Eras Tour was the best night of my life, it is a memory I will cherish forever. The other Swifties were so kind, and wonderful. I honestly could not imagine a better concert, and I am hoping that she will have another concert in the future because I will be there with bells on"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,She was everything I had hoped and more. I saw her 17 years ago as an opener for Brad Paisley. The production she puts on is unlike any show / concert I have ever seen and I hope I am lucky enough to experience a future tour of hers!
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The best and amazing concert ever! Im not a swiftie but after I watched it, I think i am now. Lol"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Besides having side stage tickets this was an incredible night. Sadly we couldn’t see front of stage, just on screen. Section. 243. Had no choices when ticket codes went out. All that was available. Better than not seeing her live. Would I have paid $2000 for this seat? No way! Have fun whoever is going she’s incredible / choreo is top notch"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The concert was an amazing experience! However if you have floor seats and struggle with height you will
not be able to see and your view will be obstructed. I had to move behind my seat to see and had issues with security requesting me to return back to my seat. When I advised them I couldn’t see and the amount I paid for the ticket they left me alone. Other than that it was worth the price and it felt like being in the eras tour movie."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"I loved this show.  I was excited to have this experience with my daughter (this was more for her then it was for me) and I think it was for sure one of the top 3 concerts I’ve ever attended (and I have quite the concert resume).  I have nothing but amazing things to say about the show my only point of contention was the merch lines.  It was atrocious.  3 hours in a line to miss the opening act (because of the door opening restraints) to finally get to the stand to find everything is basically sold out or not in size.  It was profoundly disappointing.  I would recommend buying merch online (evening it’s a little different than what’s available at the venue).  Or at least have early day sales on concert days for ticket holders.  It was by far the worst merch sales experience I’ve ever had, and that was me going in KNOWING it wasn’t gonna be great.  The line up took away some of the fun of what the show experience should have been.  

All In all, I’ll give the over all experience 4 stars (her performance was a 10/5 but that merch line killed a star for me.  Excellent show Taylor, you were incredible. You should be very proud of your successes, that many shows is beyond impressive.  Great job! ❤️"
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Everything about the concert was great (Toronto N3), but my friends and I got sent to different gates to get into the venue and were told our tickets would not scan in at a different gate. All the tickets had been booked together using the same account and payment method and were all next to each other, so it was very frustrating to be split up."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,wish i could go again best experience ever. Everything went smoothly and it was perfect.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,I’ve been to many concerts but Taylor Swift was by far the best concert I have ever seen! Everything was so organized and on time!
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The show itself was beyond amazing. Taylor put on an energetic performance with beautiful visuals for 3.5 hours, an absolute 5/5! My ticket however, did not say limited or obstructed view and there was a definite obstruction. The large speaker was directly in the sightline of her diamond stage where she spends most of her time. I was quite disappointed that I was not aware prior to purchasing that this would be the case. Although I could watch much of the show on the screen, I could not see Taylor on the diamond stage. Fan services said there was nothing they could do. I would not have been as sad, if I had at least been prepared for the poor view which definitely impacted the full enjoyment of the show. I would otherwise have given this experience a higher rating."
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Not a true swiftie....but concert was beyond my expectations. True artist that loves what she does and goes 100% to deliver to her fans. Daughter loved the show.
11/19/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Taylor did it again. I was amazed by her previous concert but this one topped it. The amount of details everything is planned out to is amazing. I had high expectations but it was better than I imagined. Was disappointed by the lack of planning and shipping vip packages. Would be nice if they arrived before the concert and not after. Wish I could attend the other shows!
11/18/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,Best concert I have ever been to! Taylor is and amazing performer! And her outfots were stunning
11/18/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"The energy was electric!  50,000 people singing and dancing for over 3 hours. Stage was amazing. The lights. Her energy and performance was so engaging and so professional and she knows how to work the crowd. Genius! Crowd was polite and Roger’s staff got things done and people in quick. Drinks way too expensive and bathrooms. Wow 2 stalls. Women in men’s cause maintenance issues. But I don’t think many got drinks or left their seats. So all good!"
11/18/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Concert was incredible.  She put on an amazing show.  The costumes were beautiful.  The whole experience of having the tickets and getting emails ahead of the show was very helpful.
I like that the food and drinks were Taylor inspired.  Atmosphere was incredible."
