1/13/25,BC Place - Vancouver,"Words are truly not enough to fully encapsulate the energy, excitement and impressiveness that was The Eras Tour. Having seen the show on 3 separate occasions (Seattle and Vancouver x2), I never grew tired of walking through those stadium gates; the eager concert goers trading friendship bracelets with everyone they saw, the sparkling outfits that you know took months and months of preparation, the Swift-themed menu items, the spontaneous singalongs...and this was all before Taylor took the stage. The show itself felt more like a fever dream than a concert. The talent, coordination, composure and athleticism required to put on such a production is something that will be studied in high regard for years to come. The set flowed immaculately and went by in a blink, despite it being 3h long. Between the inside jokes, traditions old and new and overall classic Taylor Swift dazzling energy, this was a tour made for the fans, and it did not disappoint. Truly one of the best shows I have ever had the privilege of seeing. I will remember this tour all too well in the most enchanting way. Long Live the Eras Tour <3"
12/18/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"absolutely incredible. the atmosphere & energy in the venue  was unlike anything I have ever felt before. being surrounded by fans who were happy and wanted to celebrate the final show. it was a true form of girlhood. I have never felt safer in a room of 60,000 people. Taylor and everyone involved in this show made everything so magical."
12/17/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The show was everything one could hope it would be. Entry into and security for BC Place was smooth and professional, had no problems getting drink, food, merch, and leaving afterwards. The systems put into place to move folks through every aspect were clearly well considered. Taylor and her crew were just incredible. Words cannot describe how immensely amazing the entire evening was."
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Untouchable is what The Eras Tour is and was! I had the time of my life fighting dragons with everyone that was there in person, and via the grainy livestreams. While I will always always wish that many a bot didn’t get their hands on tickets to resell via third party sites, I can’t help but appreciate that Taylor and her team also offered “no view” seats for the final weekend. That said, our seats still had an incredible view with the added bonus of seeing the entire tour crew in a behind the scenes style way. We sang, shook it off, cried, cheered (1-2-3 LGB), and left glitter on the floor after the party."
12/16/24,BC Place - Vancouver,One of the best concerts I've been to this year!! Taylor will always be amazing at what she does!
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Half of the main stage and 1/3 of the screen was BLOCKED by a light tower and lights. Yet we had NO idea of this when choosing to spend an EXTREME amount of money that we thought would give us a good clear view.
12/15/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Just incredible vibe! Taylor and anll her crew are amazing! They put an unforgettable show!
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,Taylor Swift is magnificent. She is so beautiful and talented. She has awesome energy and she is a total entertainer. I love her.
12/14/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"The best tour experience even though seats were at the back the experience was the best. Taylor, Gracie and her team gave their all for the tour."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"I waited so long to get tickets to The Eras Tour and let me tell you, I’m glad it happened the way it did! Taylor is an AMAZING performer. Such a great show! Cried, laughed, danced, and made memories to last forever! I will never forget this experience. Looking forward to another Taylor Swift show in the future! 10/10!"
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"It's Taylor Swift. It's the Eras Tour. So of course the show itself was incredible!!! I also saw her at Levi Stadium last summer and loved it then, too.
The reason for only 4 out of 5 stars: Unfortunately for the Vancouver show, I was in section 455, and there was a light structure on the floor with pyrotechnics on top that totally blocked center stage and the center of the big screen. The only other screens were relatively small and at the top of BC Place. Because of this, me and those around me missed out on a lot. Having traveled from CA and having paid a lot for my ticket, this was pretty disappointing."
12/13/24,BC Place - Vancouver,"Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is, without a doubt, one of the most extraordinary and iconic live performances of our time. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that blends musical history, emotional storytelling, and unparalleled stagecraft into an unforgettable night. In terms of sheer spectacle and artistry, The Eras Tour is a benchmark in concert history. It’s the kind of event that leaves you thinking, “I was there.” Witnessing Taylor Swift in her prime, commanding the stage with grace, passion, and charm, is an experience that will stay with you forever. Whether you're a die-hard Swiftie or a newcomer, it’s impossible to leave the show without feeling like you've just witnessed one of the most incredible performances ever to grace the stage. Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour is not just a concert—it’s an event. An event that celebrates the power of music, the joy of shared experiences, and the artistry of one of the most talented musicians of our time."

11/25/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,I have seen almost every Eras Tour livestream and this was still worth every penny.  Taylor and her team put on an amazing show that would entertain even the smallest fan.  The show was such an experience that the time flew by.  She knows how to please her fans.  Can't wait for the next tour.
11/22/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Attending Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour was nothing short of magical! From start to finish, the entire experience was perfectly orchestrated. Ticketmaster made the process seamless, and the anticipation leading up to the event only added to the excitement.

Taylor’s performance was absolutely phenomenal. Her stage presence, vocals, and the stunning visuals made every moment unforgettable. Each era came to life with its own unique charm, taking us on a nostalgic journey through her musical evolution. The energy in the crowd was electric, and you could feel the love and connection Taylor shares with her fans.

The venue was well-organized, with clear signage and helpful staff. Entry was smooth, and the sound quality was impeccable throughout the night. I especially appreciated how Ticketmaster kept us updated on event details leading up to the show, which made planning so much easier.

This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m so grateful to Ticketmaster for helping make it happen. Thank you for bringing us closer to an artist who means so much to so many. I’ll cherish this night forever!"

The experience is only topped by the amazing talent and theatrics of Taylor and her crew. I will forever be a fan and will do my best to never miss a show tour, even if it means traveling out of town."
11/13/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,The show was spectacular! I don't know if any concert will ever beat this. I am still in shock that I was able to see the Eras tour in person.
11/12/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"An amazing experience! Eras lived up to the hype! Taylor was fantastic, on stage for +3 hours and was incredibly engaging. The Swifties were out in force, such a great community; the SuperDome was filled with love and support."

11/8/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,"Taylor was a bucket list performer for my daughter and I. Girl got some pipes on her! Not once did she show signs of tiring as my daughter and I sang our hearts out! I've never felt nor experienced so much positive energy in one place in my life! Words could NEVER describe Taylor other than it was a magical experience that you HAVE to be there for! We were there, it was rare, I will remember it for the rest of my life! ❤️ Be prepared for withdraws! Lol"
11/7/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,As a mom my heart will cherish this night for the rest of my life.   It was pure love.   The excitement and joy resonating from every person in that arena added to the insane brilliance of the show itself.  I wish there were words in the English language to do the evening justice.   So I will settle on being grateful for that 3.5 hours with my daughter.   It will stay with us forever.
11/4/24,Caesars Superdome - New Orleans,Ticketmaster sucks but I sat in front of it refreshing the page for 2 hours to get my seats behind the stage for $49

1/31/25,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"From start to finish it was a smooth process. Parking was very expensive, t it the venue is great!

11/22/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,I saw Morgan wallen at Lucas oil and the music quality was eh. I was nervous for Taylor bc I read online that the acoustics weren’t great to performers in there - but Taylor was amazing!! I was in the nose bleeds and still had an amazing experience. The show started on time and it was so amazing and worth the money! Best concert ever!
11/20/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"I could never say enough good things about this tour. It was everything my daughter and I could have dreamed of. The fight to get tickets was horrendous, but the venue itself was amazing. The security team was phenomenal, everyone we interacted with was so kind, and the merch stands were set up very well considering how busy they were. It was easy to get to our seats and find the nearest restroom. I loved that because of the demographic, men’s restrooms were converted to women’s as well, I never had to wait in line more than a few minutes. And the concert itself was the absolute best concert I’ve ever been to hands-down, the production is insane."
11/14/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"As a fan of over 18-19 years. It was always my dream to see Taylor in concert! Seeing the eras tour was one of the most magical experiences and nights of my life! The whole experience and atmosphere of being with thousands of other swifties just being ourselves and having the absolute best time! It was a healing moment for the younger self in me in such a way I never thought possible! The kindness and love shown everywhere throughout the concert was incredible! And it was all because of Taylor Swift and her whole team for putting on such a beautiful performance for over 69,000 people! We were so lucky to have gotten to go and if we could we would do it a thousand times more! Just amazing! Thank Taylor Swift for everything and being the most loving and fun person that you are! Being a fan of you just makes life a little easier-all thanks to you and your wonderful team!"

11/9/24,Lucas Oil Stadium - Indianapolis,"The Taylor Swift concert was Fantastic and Amazing, of course.  The experience of using Ticketmaster was Terrible - Long wait times, uncertain times of tickets dropping, finally being in the Queue, only to get to the front of the line, here we go, let's buy tickets... Only to be kicked out and told tickets were gone. Then able to get back in the Queue... And the same thing over again. Ticketmaster needs to do better. And needs to weed out sales to scalpers!!"

2/26/25,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor was amazing!! The overall Eras Tour from the moment walking into the stadium, seeing the stage for the first time to Gracie's opening act and the production building up the excitement, to finally seeing Taylor was an experience of a lifetime. She really put a lot of hard work and thought into creating a special and memorable experience for her swifties, giving it her all performing from era to era. I would have loved to see her perform Long Live but hopefully she will add that ""permanently""to the setlist on her next upcoming tour! :)"

She is a big Swiftie. My daughter said it doesn’t get better than this!!   She was over the moon!! Thank you Ticketmaster!!
12/1/24,Rogers Centre - Toronto,"Taylor Swift was fantastic! The arena was electric with high energy and anticipation as the clock ticked down to the opening. I had tears & goose bumps when she appeared to open her show. I watched the fans around me, of all ages, singing along. I watched the lights throughout the audience and stage, and it was incredible how it all worked together, so impressive! The coreography, dancers, singers were great and they looked like they were having fun. 
Most impressive was Taylor's performance! Over 3 hours of, singing, dancing, playing guitar and piano... high energy & emotion throughout. It was an experience I will never forget!"

It was easy to find our seats, the staff were absolutely wonderful to deal with and the line ups were managed well by the staff. What can I say about Taylor?

Other than that the night was amazing!"
