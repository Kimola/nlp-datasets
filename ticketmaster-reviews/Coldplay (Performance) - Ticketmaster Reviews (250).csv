7/6/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay really knew how to put on a show I’ve never seen so much confetti and fun special extras in one show . It really was an unforgettable experience to be there and to experience all the songs we grew up on live.

6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"If you EVER get the chance, don’t hesitate, buy the ticket and go!  

Master of their music, their message and their connection to their audience. 

I was on my feet from the first note and until the lights came up. A moving and soul refilling experience with 50000 of my new friends.  

A must see for everyone and a must see again if you already have …"

HER was amazing but Coldplay…. They were amazing! The sound was even better than the last time!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was hands down the best concert I have ever been to. It's such an interactive experience - the light up bracelets (which are recyclable), the balloons, the streamers/confetti. I had the time of my life!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"This was the most amazing show! Coldplay never disappoints! Chris Martin pulls the audience in and doesn’t let go, somehow making 50,000 people feel like they are at an intimate show, the band is rock solid in their performance. I was transcended to another place in time and place. Adventure of a Lifetime!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Stage presence from Coldplay was best I have ever seen in a long time in a concert. Great idea for the wrist bands changing colors!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay are true musicians and Chris Martin has endless energy. The wristbands add an extra element of fun alongside the music. Highly recommend this concert!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Wow Coldplay is always an amazing time. Seen them twice now and they consistently have this magical way of making you feel so positive about yourself and everyone around you. I swear I left that concert with love for all 50,000 audience members that experienced it with me. They stay humble and use their money to make positive change so it makes you feel good supporting them. A role model for all popular acts: get on the level!!!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great performance; Coldplay really control the stage, and everyone was so high and engaged. Moreover, love how they promote sustainability and make it fun; even did a land acknowledgment, that’s really good"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was, hands down, the very best concert I've ever been to (and I've been fortunate to have been to many). Coldplay puts on an amazing show and there is always such joy and positivity in the crowd (which plays off the joy of the band). Fantastic sound and amazing performance!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"We had the best experience ever. A 2 hrs singalong , unforgettable moments. We are lucky enough to be able to see them twince, and looking forward for next one. We have traveled from Toronto to Vancouver to see them, and once again, Coldplay created an amazing,  out of this world , magical night. Thank you Coldplay, see you next time."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,The energy and way that Chris connects with his audience was amazing!  I’d fly to another city again to see him perform! I also heard every top song he’s released. 🙌🙌
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a fabulous concert! Chris Martin made parts feel like an intimate performance, working the crowd like no other. Amazing light show & brilliant performance all the way around. A special surprise to see Bryan Adams perform!"
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,The concert was all that was promised and a bonus with Brian Adams participating with cold play.   I enjoyed the connection of the concert in general by bring everyone together and speaking directly to the audience with powerful music.
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Just absolutely amazing. 
Audience involvement, amazing bracelet light-show, surprise guest, commitment to sustainability and the environment.

Coldplay absolutely killed it! Already looking forward to their next show."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Coldplay was so awesome! Took both my daughters to their first concert and they had a blast! The only thing that was a little disappointing is there were no fireworks allowed due to the fire ban. Having fireworks would've brought the show to a hole new level but even without them it was amazing!!! We would see them again for sure!!
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"The event starts really early and stretches it out to the point of breaking before Coldplay arrive. The weak support acts inna rap group, 070 skate (or shake? Basically some girl drugged out of her mind,l and HER do well to establish the VAST chasm between opening acts and the massive superstars Coldplay have become.

As someone who has followed the band avidly since the release of X&Y, this was a bucket list item that just had to happen. Flew from Pakistan to Toronto, then from Toronto to Vancouver just for this event. The set list comprised of the classics as well as some fan-service songs and some of the newer works, which definitely take some time to get used to. Watching your favourite bad parade around in alien Masks and singing to an odd dll isn't easy on the eye, and the songs that accompanied them were bang average.

But I came for the classics and that I got. Paradise, The Scientist, Yellow, Clocks, A Sky Full of Stars, and of course, Fix You. From playing the matter and the first one in my room to seeing the band perform them on stage was a dream come true. Chris's energy is infectious and it did the impossible - pulled the crowd back from the brink after those infuriatingly mediocre opening acts. The wait was longer than normal too. I got there at 3pm to get floor views at rhe very front, so my feet were dead by the end.

I wish there were some of the songs from the albums in the middle, such as X&Y, but they weren't understandably skipped for the newer material, since that's what the band will automatically promote. The original alt rock sound has changed a lot in recent works, but somehow the spirit of the band remains intact. While AHFOD and MOTS aren't albums I'd re-listen to, the older stuff is always something that pulls me back, and I'll definitely attend a concert again whenever I get the chance."
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Best most immersive concert i've attended at BC place. Coldplay cares so much about making a difference in our world and even their concert reflected that. Fantastic experience
6/9/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"We have such a nice time watching them last Saturday at BC place. A very talented, warm hearted performer. I love when he invited a kid to get in the stage to make a song for the lil kid’s birthday. No one compares to this band. Wish for more concerts from them."
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a wonderful experience the best I have received there so far and I have Ben to a lot of shows there!

Helpful staff outside the venue ready to help (for me was my bag size).

No line ups to get in, no line ups for food and beverages..

The only line up was the Ladies bathroom (normal) lol..

Overall had a fantastic evening!

Side note - Coldplay was phenomenal!

I was so happy it hurt to see Bryan Adams show up as well, what a dream of an evening!

Thank you, thank you, thank you to you all!!!!"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"We absolutely loved the show, high quality performances, they delivered positive energy to L of us and love to our earth! We love cold play! It has always been my dream to be at their concert!"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Great show. Sound system was good, crowd control professional and lighting wrist watches was brilliant. Show finished on time before the trains stopped. The staff all over the venue were welcoming."
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,I saw them 20 years ago in London when they had been together a few years and I have wanted to see them since. Coldplay didn’t disappoint! I was lucky to attend both nights and I will say that not only did I dance my butt off but i also found myself crying while listening to some of my favourite songs! From the first moment (well done on the land acknowledgment) to the very end - you left all us all feeling like we had just experienced a show that could be summarized in no other word than MAGIC! Thank you for putting on one hell of a show!
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,Absolutely amazing.  It could have all been recorded music and the production would still be worth it.  Amazing to see how they are trying to decrease their carbon footprint and giving back to environmental causes as well.  I was so sad when it was all over.
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"What a great show with positive vibes. It was unfortunate that they did not have enough merchandise in varying sizes, and the merchandise was a small fit. There weren’t enough pins or light up bracelets for everybody who was in attendance, which was also a shame. The music was fantastic. Coldplay are great performers and it was a great night!"
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"It was so worth it. The stage setup and lights were spectacular!! A little sad they ran out of wristbands so we didn’t get one, but being there and able to see the show made up for it. Chris was so energetic and engaging. The band was amazing. Would definitely buy tickets to see them again whenever they come back."
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,It was a great concert for the entire family! It was truly a spectacle for the eyes as well as the ears! H.E.R. was a great second opener. The first opener ( don't recall her name )  not so much. She appeared to be drunk or stoned and her music was not good. Add her potty mouth to the mix and I'm not quite sure how anyone thought this was a good fit with Coldplay. It was also a treat to have Bryan Adams make a surprise visit to the stage. Coldplay was amazing.
6/10/22,BC Place - Vancouver,This concert was by far the best one i’ve ever been to. From the opening message to the opening acts to of course Coldplay themselves. It was unbelievable. The bracelets really made it a crowd experience and it made the whole concert feel so special. 10/10 I will be going again!!!
6/11/22,BC Place - Vancouver,"Fireworks would've been the icing on the cake but it was unfortunate Vancouver didn't get any. Other than that, hands down Coldplay was the best concert I've been to!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was truly amazing. Great music, fireworks and lights. The only thing negative  was that it was a little too loud. It almost sounded like it was blowing the speakers at times. I honestly think it would have sounded even better if it were down a few decibels. I’m surprised Chris Martin wouldn't be more sensitive to the volume."
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"This was my second time to see Coldplay, and once again, it was a thrill! From the moment the guys came on stage, the music was awesome, as were the lights and fireworks. I have been a Coldplay fan for many years, and seeing them live has created some of my very best memories. It's amazing how good music can make you feel. I also love the fact that Coldplay does so many positive things with their fame and money, which is not something you see that often from celebrities. There were images and information projected prior to the concert to show some of their worldwide projects. As far as the musical selection, there was a great mix from all of the albums, from Parachutes to Music of the Spheres. My daughter's boyfriend, who is actually a country fan, was impressed and even commented that ""Chris Martin has the voice of an angel."" (Well, I already knew that, but still...) It was a really fun night, and I can't wait to see my British Boys again!"
6/11/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay never lets you down!! Whether you are on the floor or in the nose bleeders, they seem to manage reaching everyone with a great live show!! The light up wrist bands are one of my fave parts!!!"
6/12/22,FedExField - Landover,"Coldplay was amazing. They can throw a show and have you smiling all night. Fireworks, interactive bracelets and a good time!"
6/12/22,FedExField - Landover,"The concert was great, but traffic getting to the venue was a DISASTER. There were no traffic police and  I guess the parking attendants decided to start letting everyone in at the last minute because whatever they were doing wasn’t helping the flow of traffic. Basically, I stayed 5 minutes from the venue and it took me 45 minutes to get to fedex field because of stand still traffic. So I missed 45 minutes of the show. The LED bracelets were great but I wish they would’ve worked for every song."
6/12/22,FedExField - Landover,"I cannot tell you how much I have taken this group into my heart.  My husband has been a fan from the start but ever since seeing them in Melbourne in 2017 (birthday present for hubby) I have been a little in love with them.  Their music and ‘stage show’ (wristbands) are fabulous, they seem like such lovely human beings and thank their fans after every gig.  Who could ask for more?"
6/12/22,FedExField - Landover,"great opening acts.  gave us enough break in between to the real show start.  When Coldplay came out, the fireworks were unexpected.  The energy of the concert from the band to the audience was so lively. I was entertained the whole time.  Vibe of the concert was high the whole time! We had a couple of encore songs! It was fantastic! I can't wait to go again!!"
6/12/22,FedExField - Landover,"This was the best concert I’ve had!!! All the experience was great (with the exception of the parking logistic). But everything was awesoooome!! The sound, the show, food, seats, EVERYTHIIIIING!!"
6/12/22,FedExField - Landover,"I wasn’t even that into Coldplay, just going with a friend, but I was quickly won over. They waited to start because so many people were held back by the horrible traffic, so I didn’t miss the show! The event made an effort to have environmental initiatives that I’ve never seen before, including having people on bikes and kinetic floors powering it. I loved the performance aspect of engaging the crowd as well as the music- even though I only knew their old stuff, their new songs were great too. So much fun!"
6/12/22,FedExField - Landover,Amazing. Judt like last time. Took my son this time (he's 9) and he had a blast too. Will come see them again next time they come!
6/12/22,FedExField - Landover,"Had a blast at the concert; got to the venue EARLY so we had NO problems with the parking!  LOVED the opening acts and Coldplay put on a wonderful show.  The amount of energy is electrifying!  They could've skipped using the puppet but it was not a deal breaker.  Sad that one day soon this band will stop touring.  They really care about the environment; was happy to see everything GREEN-themed. LOVED the wrist bands, fireworks, balloons and confetti.  Keep up the great work!  Thanks for the special  DC song from the good 'ole WHFS festival days!  Do not miss this band when they return!  We'll be there!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Me and my wife took our teenage kids to their first concert. Exceeded expectations. The kids loved it too. The integration with the wristband lights made for a great time. Classic and new songs played made for a hoarse throat and ringing ears.  Just brilliant. Chris’s integration with the crowd was on point
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Saw Coldplay once last time around, and this time both in NJ and Philly. The lights, the bracelets with the fireworks. Bruce Springsteen in New Jersey coming out and singing with the band was a awesome moment. Chris Martin singing Eagle fight song and then making up a song on the Fly about Philly just genius. It is an outdoor show so the sound is not perfect, but 60,000 people singing together so many of the Coldplay hits was. In New Jersey loved that there was only aluminum water bottles and aluminum cups for the drinks. Philadelphia there was still plastic, which I was very disappointed with considering the theme of conservation. You really feel like Chris Martin loves performing. His energy doesn't seem to stop and he is an awesome front man, and you can tell he's an awesome human being."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This show was pure magic, the band sounded great and the production was outstanding.  The syncronized lighted wristbands really added to the experience. The best live show I've seen in months"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,I have seen Coldplay before. This show was excellent. The sound was really good. It was a great concert. Hope they come back again. Highly recommend seeing them. Danced and sang all night long.
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Lead off performers Lizzy McAlpine and H.E.R.  we’re fantastic.  H.E.R is so talented and played guitar keyboards and drums and REALLY has some pipes. 

Coldplay performed all the great hits and the stage for the Music Of The Spheres was awesome for an outdoor evening show including synchronized fireworks.  Chris Martin tells interesting stories and bits to lead into the songs and gotta love the UK accent

Too bad it started raining before the end"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Drinks super pricey, all organized but like always people so rude and no manners at all, security the best and kind to guide us, I’m Philadelphian but first time on the LFF!! Hope is not the last. Again the best concert ever !!!!! So long Colplay hope see you sometime on my forwarded life!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"The Coldplay concert in Philadelphia on Wednesday, June 8, 2022 was phenomenal.  Also, everyone at Lincoln Financial Field did a great job. The whole experience was perfect."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"First of all , I love this band . This was my fist time seeing them live. The staging , the sound , the wrist bands , and Chris Martin’s voice and energy were excellent and exactly what I wanted and expected.
The set list was very good and the length and flow of the concert was also very good.
My complaints are that I had the feeling that it was a times a concert of live
musicians and sometimes an EDM show with a DJ spin-off times. Now , I get it that they have gone off into this new “
world” sound but if you are going to do that , at least add some additional backing singers and some keyboard and synth players so it is real. It was clearly heavily backing tracked and at times drowned out the actual instruments . The lack of any spot or stage lighting on the band members gave me the feeling that a lot of the show was tracked . For a big time band making big time money this is fraudulent IMO. Put real musicians and programmers up there and light it up like an actual performance . I literally could not tell if the bass player was actually producing any bass notes most of the night , and I am a bass player. I guess probably only musician fans care about this . My fault for not seeing them a decade ago. It was fun and the songs are great . The new album sounds like yoga music ."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Next to Pink Floyd, greatest concert I’ve ever seen.  I was never really a fan, but my wife lives them. Got her tix for her birthday and we were both blown away. The concert definitely made a fan out of me"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Everything about the Philly venue was perfect. H.E.R. and Coldplay were amazing, as anticipated. Coldplay is gracious, environmentally conscious, and 10000000% fun, talented, and creative! Haven’t missed a tour since 2000 and will continue seeing them. The rain came down heavily at the conclusion of the show and Chris stripped off his already sweaty shirt….nice bonus for us:-)"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Amazing use of technology, confetti and pyrotechnics. Such a professional group playing through the rain and highly organized. Great music. Total pros. So cool they entered and exited on the ground level and slap hands with their fans. Love their level of commitment to their fans and the environment. The staff at the Linc were so nice and very helpful. Best large concert show ever!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"It was a sentimental concert for me and my  son. We throughly enjoyed the entire experience, the concert bracelets, the globe balloons, and Chris Martins energy and command of the stage, it was a Wednesday night in Philly that would never happen again and just so good that it did."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,It was very nostalgic & touching. Starting from messages of giving back to the earth in knowing that our ticket purchased contributed to that was the most selfless act. It was also creative to have the bikes & small stations help light up the stage through kinetic energy. That was very thoughtful. There was so much love in the atmosphere. Coldplay did great in including their guests & touching their souls. They were very outgoing on stage & great with each other. I would definitely go to any or ALL of their concerts again. Nothing but LOVE!
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I've been to tons of shows and live events over the years.. And Coldplay is by far the best I've ever seen.. They are in another league.  First time seeing them and they were worth every penny and the 12 hour drive there and back.   Absolutely everything was amazing.  Crowd was amazing.  The band was flawless and combined with all the other entertainment aspects it was fun from start to finish..  the glowing bracelets is also something unique to them.  Really makes for a great visual during the show.  I would go anywhere in the country to see them again.  If you are debating if coldplay is worth it, they absolutely are.. Im 100% sold that they are the most exciting live band in the world ."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Breath taking!!! Best concert ever.  Fun from the start until the end.  Just perfect.  The crowd was full of good people whom all shared the love of this beautiful music!! Got to be on the big screen too with huge smiles and love for Coldplay.  Their music managed to touch all parts of my life and was able to feel every emotion from their live music, the lights, spheres,  confetti, fireworks, and love and laughter with the crowd whom all share the love of Coldplay. 💗"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Besides the traffic, this was an awesome show!!  So much interaction, great sound, awesome band. Gave me the chills at times!!"
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This was my 3rd time seeing Coldplay and they didn't disappoint. I cant say it was their best performance but it was definitely a lot of fun. The crowd was engaged. I hope they come back to PA again.
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Great crowd . Light bands we wore awesome . Saw him in Phila so it was really great he sang Fly Eagles Fly ! And H.E.R wore an Eagles jersey ( Malcolm Jenkins #)
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This was my first time seeing Coldplay and it was by far my favorite concert yet! From the sound to the lighting and their concern for all things environmental, they are a class act."
6/12/22,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I’ve seen Coldplay about 10 times now and I swear, each time is better. This was an UNREAL show and the energy was truly ELECTRIC!!! It was my husbands 2nd time seeing them but the first time was at The Today Show. He is now addicted and wants to go again!!! If you’re debating, just DO IT. You will not regret it!!!"
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"I had been waiting my whole life to finally go to a Coldplay concert. I waited so long that I was scared it wouldn’t meet my expectations, but it surpassed them by a billion. It was the best concert I had ever been to. I was so overwhelmed by how happy I was tgat I couldn’t stop crying for hours after the concert. If I had the money I would go to every single one. I cant wait for the day I get to experience a Coldplay concert again. They’re the best!!!! Everyone should go to a Coldplay concert at least once in their life. It was truly life changing."
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"This show was incredible.  Coldplay always delivers an amazing performance.  Even with the rain, uninformed staff and audio issues, I still had the time of my life.  I would recommend going to see them to anyone anywhere."
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,Show itself was amazing! Coldplay never disappoints! My only negative was getting into the show - we had floor tickets and had to go all the way to the South Gate which made no sense because by the time we walked through we were intermingled with everyone else! Would have been much quicker to have a “GA” line at every gate. Also there should be a bank of portable potties on the floor.
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,First time seeing Coldplay that was a mistake on my part. This show was fantastic. I've seen over 300 shows. This was probably the best light show I've ever seen and I've seen great ones. The music was great. The interaction with the audience was great. The only drawback was the sound was a little too loud creating distortion of the vocals. But earplugs fix that issue.
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"First post Covid concert experience and it did not disappoint.  It was a celebration of life, love and happiness!  Glad to be back at concerts and no better way to start than with Coldplay"
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"Once we got in, Coldplay put on a great show!  Quite a difference from our first time seeing them at PNC Arts Center!  More bling!  Getting in though was a nightmare. Horrible venue. No direction. Would never go to this venue again…too disorganized."
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,The concert was awesome! I am extremely glad that I made it to the show and got to experience HER for the first time as well as Coldplay. The concert was a great experience despite the rain. Can’t wait to do it again!
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,This concert was amazing start to finish. The vocals for starters Chris Martin nailed it. The set and lights including the cool interactive bracelets kept the place aglow. Even in the pouring rain people stayed till the end of this magical experience.
10/1/23,Lincoln Financial Field - Philadelphia,"We’ve been waiting to see Coldplay for several years and this concert did not disappoint. The band was fantastic! Light displays, confetti showers and fireworks were spectacular! Venue staff was super polite and friendly. We had a great time."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,One of the best concerts I have been into. The message that they deliver is amazing and the vibes are unbelievable. Loved the concert and the ambiance!
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"What an incredible experience. It's not just a concert it's a show. I took my son and told him, balls were never allowed back in my day and when Coldplay released all the balls for the crowd, it was amazing. You wear bracelets that light up in sequence throughout the show. It was a very long show and we loved it. The opening acts, especially the second one was not good at all. Coldplay are amazing people that care for many things and their fans. Would 100% go again! Oh, the fireworks were over the top and made it magical!"
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Tickets are so expensive nowadays to not consider giving everyone the best view possible. You can tell they tried, but most of the time Chris and the band were far away and/or blocked out of view for fans in the lower bowl due to some structures and towers being out-of-position.
I still remember the U2 concert at Qwest Field (as it was known then) more than a decade ago, where the stage was in the middle of the pitch. That stage was especial, and it offered a much better experience for everyone. Probably one of the greatest concerts in the stadium too."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I absolutely loved every second of it! They had great openers to start with! They had a truly magical experience! The show was so inclusive and welcoming and so so special! I am really honored to have seen the show with my family and friends! I loved that the show was using green energy and that you could partake in making energy for the stages to light up!
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Better (last time they were in Lumen Field) and best show. The energy generated by Chris, the band and their songs was incredible. Love the huge round screens, the fun colorful balloons, the amazing light show. Love the part when Chris invited three young guys who travelled more than 13,000 miles from Indonesia joining him on stage."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Don’t get me wrong, Coldplay was amazing, and always has been. But I’ve been to many concerts at Lumen Field with no issue. This one was def off. It started with the first performer, when you could not hear any word they were saying because their mic was too high. When Coldplay showed up it was a little better but not great. And I’ve seen them multiple times where their sound was perfect! They were either too loud or too quiet. 
But like I said, it had nothing to do with them. They were still great, and I would still do it again. I had fun with my friends, and that was the important part. 
It’s always fun when they interact with the crowd. Everyone always enjoys that."
10/1/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay…need I say more. Their music, their charisma..just everything.  I love that they carry Wooteo around with them as a reminder of Jin and BTS as their musical siblings."
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It was the best concert i have ever been to! And it will probably be difficult to top this off. I just wished Lumen Field had more Marshalls or staff to point people to their seats. A lot of people got confused looking for the correct seats. Some seats are labelled, in example, Block 307 Row II or Row HH, which is super confusing especially to those who have not been to the stadium before. Otherwise, THE.BEST.CONCERT.EVER!!"
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I could write a whole letter about coldplay! I’m a big fan since I was 11 years old .. so  after this 23 years been in 5 of this MOTS tour it’s been super cool their shows bring magic to the stadium and healing music to the soul ♥️♥️♥️♥️
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay didn't disappoint and thankfully so since I traveled to the concert from Wisconsin! They are insanely talented, know how to get a crowd engaged, and make you feel like they are singing to you. I love that they are socially conscious and bring that to their venues."
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This was one of the best concert performances I've seen in a while.  So fantastic what Coldplay is doing for the environment
]"
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Just. Amazing, my only concern is that I'm no sure of I will enjoy another concert as much as I enjoyed this one Coldplay is in a different category"
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"It's Coldplay, that sums it up.  If you've seen them live, you'll know what I mean.  They are out of this world live.  I have been a fan for 20+ years and they are still at the top of my list of favorites.  The music, the lights, the confetti, the pyro (if your lucky enough to get pyro at your show), the different stages - it's just second to none.  The floor experience is not to be missed.  It is an immersive experience and should be on your bucket list.  After every concert - I eagerly await the next time they tour."
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Amazing concert! They played all their classics. We took our daughters for their first concert and it couldn’t have been a better concert to attend!
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,This was the most amazing performance I have ever seen. With all the lights and the fireworks and the amazing community of the concert. I went there with my mother and this is definitely going to be a core memory for me. We got all dressed up and had an amazing time.
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"We were in the upper level to the right of the stage and must have been right where multiple speaker sound waves collided. It overpowered our ears and we heard mostly background music when the group was all performing together, no vocals. When Chris was mostly singing by himself, the vocals were, of course, great. Overall, we really enjoyed the experience. We were very disappointed in the audio though. We’ll sit in a different section for sure next time."
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Nothing beats the show that Coldplay puts on. Fireworks, Xlobands, awesome music and you leave with a restored faith in humanity!  Everyone should see them at least once"
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Just an emotional rollercoaster, given how legendary their songs are. Moved to tears twice. Brought along my parents and they loved it."
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"They played their most excellent music, the band kept the crowd involved the lights were fantastic the giant balloons and fireworks!!! I recommend staying to the end it was sooo worth it!! They just kept singing more great songs!!  The crowd is not at all bad and I felt completely safe walking solo back to my car a mile away.  Do not agree ahead to park at Hilton just park there and walk. I double paid such a joke paying ahead for parking there."
10/2/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"We last saw Coldplay 15 years ago in Winnipeg in an area and it was memorable.  The venue was much smaller, but the energy was incredible ... fast forward to 2023 and here we are with 58,000 people who were all in tune with one another and in awe of the perfectly choreographed spectacle that the guys were starting to develop way back in 2009.    I loved every second of it.    I had my wife and two daughters with me and we all knew what to expect ... but it ended up being so much more.  Thank you Coldplay for the lifelong memory. God put a smile on our faces, and every tear drop was a waterfall."
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"After a long wait, a concert that didn’t happen, Covid on my end. Soul crushing. Thinking I would not get to see Coldplay ever. Then extended tour dates and it finally happened!  The experience was everything I hoped for and knew it would be - absolutely positively, amazing! My only disappointment was that it had to end!"
10/4/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"This was my 3rd time seeing Coldplay and they never disappoint! Aside from being amazing musicians, the visuals, the confetti, the pyrotechnics, the bracelets each guest wears that lights up in sync with the music, the giant balloons/bouncy balls- and their messages/passion for being kind to all. 

Each time I’ve sent them, I’ve been moved to tears at some point during their shows! I would see them 100x Such a FUN, engaging, happy, special show! 

If you EVER have the opportunity to see them live, do it! You won’t regret it! This time I took my kids who are now teens, which has been a dream of mine, and they loved every minute!"
10/5/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Out of all the western acts/concerts I've been to, no one can top the energy and awesomeness of their concert! They're next to my BTS group."
10/5/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"I went with my daughter for her first concert. Coldplay is my fave all time! She was hesitant but she lit up and now keeps thanking me for the beast experience!!
Hands down Magical!"
10/5/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Coldplay was AMAZING! INCREDIBLE! I enjoyed every bit of their performance. I loved how Chris Martin engaged with the audience. He is a great showman! The special effects such as confetti, bouncing planets, colorful lights and wristbands made it memorable and one of a kind. I would go see them again ! The Lumen Field was clean, comfortable and made my experience enjoyable and one of a kind too. I will never forget my first Coldplay and stadium concert !"
10/5/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,I bought floor tickets for the first time. I’m not sure if I will buy them again. It was so chaotic. It was an experience for sure. Coldplay always puts on a good show. For the opening act 070 or whatever the name was. She does not belong with this crowd. I felt very confused and concerned for the artist. I love to see artist that are young and talented but….. That aside there really should be more alcohol enforcement. I will always support artist so I will go to another concert. Just hoping not to smell a porta potty the whole concert and have intoxicated people falling over and knocking me over.
10/5/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"Incredible show of music and lights. Extatic atmosphere in the stadium. We had a blast, although the sound was pretty bad at the beginning but got better later."
10/5/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,Awesome music with amazing energy. The floor experience was just so immersive; felt like Chris Martin was singing with you with everyone chanting and dancing all around you. Loved the wrist bands lighting up the whole stadium with the music!
10/5/23,Lumen Field - Seattle,"The absolute best, most amazing, beyond magical show I have ever experienced. My heart actually hurts now that it's over."
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,The guys of Coldplay did not disappoint.  The music was fantastic and the light show being synchronized with each song was the best I’ve ever seen.  The added component of synchronized lights on our wristbands made us feel connected to the band in a special uplifting way.  Loved their performance!  My only complaint is that they ran out of wristbands so we didn’t all get one.  I’m glad I got the chance to go!
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This was one of the best concerts I have ever been to. Coldplay sounded amazing.  We loved the light up wristbands that they handed out- it really enhanced the experience.
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Coldplay can put on a show!!! Coldplay has been my favorite band for years and hearing them play a perfect arrangement of old and new songs with such spectacular lights brought me to literal tears..... quite a few times. I also love that they are advocates of such a great cause in going green and saving our planet. The ticket money goes towards the amazing cause. such an amazing group of people and such passionate fans!!
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We had such a fun time at Coldplay. This is my second time seeing them in Atlanta, and both concerts were terrific! They really put on a show."
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This concert was amazing.  I was a little upset about the bag policy, because they enforced it very strictly with the sizes if you were over even half an inch they sent you back... if you don't have a car you have to carry your stuff with you and you need to fit it somewhere.   I think the transparent bag policy was not the best, I am not going to buy a transparent bag only for a concert.  Everything went smoothly with the digital tickets.  I was a little upset that in order to get drinks you had to make a separate line for beer and another one for liquor.  Other than that I was very pleased with everything."
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I was down at the floor level, definitely recommended for this kind of show! Very interactive with the screens and the bracelets and the confetti and the giant globe balls. 10/10!"
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The audio was loud but distorted. It was very hard to understand Maria the Scientist, H.E.R. Was better, but the audio throughout the show was terrible. Even though Coldplay was great."
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"It was my first time at The Mercedes Benz Stadium and it was Amazing!. I’m totally impressed for how big it is and for the incredible things that you could eat and drink inside, my seats was perfect!. Really a great first time visited!."
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was my second time seeing Coldplay. I can say with certainty that I will never get tired of seeing them. There is just so much positive energy, and the band sounds amazing live."
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Cold Play itself was fantastic, but the acoustics in the Mercedes-Benz Stadium were not. Echo was very prevalent and very hard to understand any lyrics sung or words spoken. Disappointing."
10/5/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I’ve been to quite a few concerts in the Mercedes Dome-ATL, and have pretty much given up watching future concerts there, due to poor sound quality and high ticket prices… but Coldplay was phenomenal, and the best show I have experienced there so far… and I did Floor tickets to Coldplay, Chesney, Rolling Stones and a few others."
10/6/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"The energy during the whole concert was amazing, words can’t explain it. It definitely one of the best nights ever. Coldplay are such an incredible band, they’re songs are so beautiful and just each member work so hard to make each concert the best. They have my respect for always helping organizations to help the planet. They deserve everything that’s good in this world."
10/6/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Me and my wife came from NC to watch them in Atlanta and it was one of the most beautiful and amazing concerts we’ve gone to. I am so glad we got to see them live and will definitely be back whenever they announce another US tour!
10/6/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I always wanted to see Coldplay and I was celebrating my birthday 🥳 I couldn’t think any other way that going to see Coldplay. I have the best experience of my life and the best birthday ever!
10/6/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,I love how they are trying to save the world and i know where my ticket money is going to help clean the environment.
10/6/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"I haven't been to many concerts in my life but have waited a very long time to see Coldplay and they did not disappoint.  It was the height of showmanship.  I told my wife we need to hop in the car from Atlanta and drive down to Tampa to see them again.  I was also pleasantly surprised by H.E.R. I knew of her but didn't know any her music.  She gave me Alicia Keys vibes, which is very good.  I hope Coldplay puts out another record and tours in the Southeast United States again soon. It's a must see."
10/6/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Great show with lots of crowd interaction.  A few less new songs and a few more old ones would have been nice, but I get it.  They didn't play ""Speed of Sound"" or ""Trouble"" which imo should be staples at any performance."
10/7/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"If you have never been to a Coldplay concert, stop what you are doing right now and go get tickets!  My boyfriend and I attend a lot of concerts, and while we try to find something special about each one, we couldn't pick just one thing for this show.  Everything about this show was AMAZING!  Coldplay doesn't just put on a show, you get an experience that will have you feeling giddy for a long time.  The lights, the sound, the energy, the interaction, EVERYTHING about this concert was wonderful.  We can't wait to attend another!"
10/7/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,One of the best concerts I have ever been to and I have been to alot. Great voices and a fantastic show. They really get the audience involved. They had 3 stages so everyone had a more close up experience. Well done Coldplay!
10/7/23,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Ticket said 7, band started playing about 30 minutes after 2nd warm up band finished, 30 minutes after sundown around 9:15pm
Sound system for warm ups very boomy"
6/13/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"We had a group of 6 family members who all sat together at the show.  Everything was wonderful, however, I thought the music was too loud before Cold Play went on.  There were a couple of guests before them and it was so loud that people were covering their ears and we were in the nosebleed section.  It wasn't as bad when they came on.  They had an outstanding show."
6/13/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"Coldplay was just AMAZING, what a great concert and great vibe all around. The only thing I didn’t love was H.E.R, she didn’t have much interaction with the audience and not everybody knew her songs so I think if you’re opening you should definitely work with the people who are paying to see you.

Totally incredible concert from Coldplay, we love you!!!!"
6/13/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"What a perfect event!! From the venue, the Mercedes Benz arena had very friendly and helpful staff. The roof was opened for Coldplay, very cool as the moon was shining so brightly! To Coldplay, what an awesome show, so much fun! They are so energetic and really engaged the entire audience. LOVED it!!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,This was without question the best concert I have ever been to. To see Coldplay play live was a dream come true and boy was it an experience I'll never forget. Chris Martin and the boys have a way of genuinely making you feel appreciated for being there and give 110% effort in delivering a positive and uplifting show. 5 star rating from the venue to the food and drink and the concert!!!
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,Was the best concert I have ever attended.  Visual effects were out of this world.  Would attend the concert again if it came back to Atlanta
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"My grandmother and I enjoyed the experience so much! Not only that the concert has full of surprises, it's amazing that everything is eco-friendly!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"This was genuinely the best performance that I have ever seen in my entire lifetime!  What made it even better was that it was my son’s first concert.  Coldplay exceeded all of my expectations and quite frankly blew my mind!!  I would give this all the stars, but all I have is 5 so, 5 stars!!"
6/14/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,"A show I will always remember, Mercedes Benz is such an incredible place, enjoyed every detail, food is good and affordable, had a couple beers, room temperature was PERFECT (despite it was a very hot day) and the light show is just mesmerizing! I will definitely loved the overall experience…"
6/15/22,Mercedes-Benz Stadium - Atlanta,COLDPLAY IS THE BEST BAND ever!!!!! THEY GAVE US Exactly what we wanted. They put on the best show ever. I can’t wait until they come back to Atlanta again so we can see them and have another amazing night with amazing people amazing lights amazing sound amazing love.
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I saw videos of them perform in 2017 and was like “I gotta see them next time they tour” and I saw them at Met Life in NJ, and omg. They were amazing with all their hits and great new ones from Music of the spheres. The energy and visuals were insane even from high up. Everyone should see them."
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The organization of the concert left a mostly positive impression, except navigating in the stadium itself - finding our seats turned out to be a challenge, signs, and markings were not very helpful, but the staff helped us. The music and the show itself were amazing."
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"After a never ending pandemic, I never thought I would have a chance to fulfill my long standing dream to see Coldplay.  The band gave it their all on Sunday night at Met Life Stadium.  The sheer energy shown by Chris Martin blows me away.  Coldplay’s music and feeling of the concert was uplifting, positive and a nod to our collective human-ness, our need to connect and for taking in and sharing love back to the world.  

Simply an en amazing concert and experience.  Thank you to Coldplay, it’s crew and the venue, and my fellow concert goers for making this a once in a lifetime dream come true."
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"They had an amazing performance, had the crowed going the entire show, amazing light show and fireworks. Chris is a very heartfelt person, Loved every second of it, without a doubt I will go to another tour if they have another one. First time seeing them and definitely not the last!! Bravo!"
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"What a great show! Amazing all around experience with great music, light show, fireworks, and more. seeing Coldplay is a must!"
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,One of the best concerts of my life! I will see again as soon as possible!
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I've been to my fair share of concerts over the years, and this ranks among the best ever. Phenomenal experience all around, from the artistry to the lighting to the pyrotechnics. You can tell Coldplay pour everything into it and want their fans to have the best time ever. Just mind blowing, really."
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,My dentist also went with her family and her kids said it was fantastic. I think that the show was great and then Bruce showed up at the end to put the icing on the cake! I think we all wish we had the energy Chris displayed on the stage.
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,While I've always been a fan of Coldplay this was the first time I saw them live and it won't be the last.  From the beautiful stage to all the attention to detail to making this an eco-friendly production. Also they couldn't have picked a better set list.  They played all the favorites.
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The show itself was great. 
A few things soured the experience: 
1. There was only junk food to choose from at the venue. Not a single apple or banana were available. 
2. The sound at the show was bad, I could hardly make out the words I know by heart. 
3. The long lines to board the trains at the end of the show took forever. 

Other than that, Coldplay are the best show!"
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The only other concert that compares was the Coldplay concert I went to in 2017! SO AMAZING.
Band sounded stunning and of course the visuals were out of this world! The light up bracelets really make the stadium breathtaking. A must see!"
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"what an absolute banger of a show.  even the $20 tickets wayyyyy up and to the side were an awesome experience.  it was like a giant stadium-sized party.  Chris Martin is adorable, Bruce Springsteen was the best possible surprise and I will never shut up about this."
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,This performance was amazing i loved everything about it and the visual effects got better and better each song. I will be going to the next coldplay concert any and everytime they perform.!
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,This was my first time seeing Coldplay and they exceeded any expectations that I had!! Such a diverse crowd which really shows how they can connect with all audiences. Absolutely will see them again!!!
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Loved every minute & every note of this show!! We came from Ontario, Canada as there are currently no Canadian dates for their tour. 
It was my 3rd time seeing Coldplay & they never disappoint. It was our 1st trip to NYC & NJ…..Would go back in a heartbeat 💗 
Thank you gentlemen,  for all you do for your fans 💕"
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I’ve been waiting years to see Coldplay and this show was everything I’d hope it would be and more. Can’t wait to see them again someday.
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I was there with my kids, 11 & 7, their first concert (!!) and it was amazing!! We all had a great time, danced and jumped and loved every moment. The sound was great, the band was amazing and lots of surprises!! :)"
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I’ve been attending Coldplay concerts for over a decade now, and I don’t plan on stopping for as long as they tour. There is not a bad seat in the house for their concerts. Coldplay goes out of their way with light up wristbands to make sure every fan in the venue feels like a part of the show. Already looking forward to the next time Coldplay tours the U.S."
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Loved it, loved it, loved it! They are electric and make the crowd feel so warm and welcome to the show. The pyrotechnics, confetti guns and balloons made the show just so good!"
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,The entrance at the stadium was a little un organized. They will sent you to different lines. Employees didn’t know well how to direct the crowds. Because of that I got there on the first train but I couldn’t get in for a while and I didn’t get the spot I wanted in arena.
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"I’m so happy I got to experience such an amazing show with my daughter, son  and husband! Coldplay show, music, lyrics, effects, lighting, fireworks, positive message and energy, everything was simply dreamy. To top it all off the opening shows Bea Miller, H.E.R. and Bruce Springsteen as a surprise guest!!! Unforgettable experience!!!"
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"There are not enough words to explain how amazing this concert was. Coldplay is always about good music, love, respect and most importantly having fun! Can't wait till they tour again."
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"ColdPlay was Awesome. Chris Martin had so much energy. The balloons, confetti, wristband lights, the multiple stages. And Bruce Springsteen topped the night. The family has a incredible time."
6/15/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,Loved all of the new eco friendly changes at the stadium! Everything was very clean. Concert was incredible.
6/16/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,I’ve been to a lot of concerts and this was by far my favorite and blew me away. Being on the floor made all the difference. Cannot recommend enough!
6/17/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"it was such a wonderful show. my friend and i drove 6.5 hours to see them, and it was more than worth it. wonderful visuals, wonderful music, wonderful band. 10/10 would see them again!!!"
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Coldplay’s performance at the MetLife Stadium in NJ on June 5th was phenomenal. The interaction between Chris Martin and the audience was uplifting and genuine. Their music gave us a moment in time that we were able to enjoy & appreciate their music. The fireworks, laser lights, and light up wristbands added to the spectacular performance. The images of hearts created with illumination of red wristbands reminded everyone to value and share love. In a world full of uneasiness it was a night to escape the worries of the world and be at peace. Chris Martin’s positive messages and energy was uplifting. The best concert I have attended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"Seats were great, Coldplay is amazing. Great concert, Bruce was a bonus as I looked for my vehicle...lol"
6/18/22,MetLife Stadium - East Rutherford,"The Coldplay show was absolutely amazing!  The songs were wonderful, as always, but the experience was incredible!  Coldplay shows always make you feel more hopeful, optimistic, and overall filled with 
joy when you leave. As a venue, MetLife was awesome!  They let GA in a bit early and we’re very polite in sectioning us out and having us go down to the floor in small groups so no one was running. GREAT show, GREAT venue, GREAT fans!!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"My mind was blown at the showmanship of this band.
I have enjoyed their music for years and had no idea of the fantastic show I would experience.
Stage lasers, confetti and fireworks were on point. Stage configuration was optimized for all the fans to enjoy and when they moved to the ‘back’ stage and gave the fans in the back a great view, I was impressed at how thoughtful they are to their fans."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Been a fan of Coldplay for 20 years, this was our 3rd concert and I think the best one. The wrist bands lighting up made a judge difference visually and Chris is awesome"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Love their music, first time we attend to their concert, it was the best experience of our life, We took our two sons one of them is a musician and super fan of their music. They have an incredible experience one of a kind, one I am sure they will NEVER NEVER forget. Everything went perfect, the sound, lights, the show, the positive environment. I really have no words to describe how incredible this concert was. We are crazy to see them again!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This was hands down the BEST concert I have ever been to. The openers, Gigi and H.E.R., were amazing. And Coldplay was life-changing; their show had such amazing energy!"
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Loved every second of this show. The stadium was a great venue easy to get in and out of. Of course Coldplay put on a show of a lifetime. This  show particularly was my fourth one this tour. It gets better and better every time. Thank you for such great memories Coldplay.
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"A coldplay concert is a whole different experience, from beginning to end. Regardless if you are a coldplay fan or not, if you attend this concert you will enjoy it to the fullest. The music, the lights, the special effects, the props, the bracelets that light up, the bikes, the kinetic energy floors, the fireworks just make this concert be a complete and amazing experience, your adrenaline will rise to the highest levels. Coldplay played the best hits they have during this show, you will dance and sign your heart out beginning to end. I have seen coldplay three times, this was my favorite one, definitely this is one coldplay concert you don't want to miss."
6/18/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay was amazing. !  I would go see them again anytime.  I was so worried about retrieving the tickets from my phone, but it was easy. I would definitely use ticketmaster again."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"You won’t live a show like the one that Coldplay performs twice in your life, this experience will be in my memories forever. Thank you Coldplay!"
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It was the best concert I've ever been to. The crowd was so excited, everyone was up and dancing. They had bracelets that lit up with the music, and huge balloons for the crowd to hit around the stadium. Chris knows how to get the audience to participate and let us know how much he appreciated us coming out on a super hot Tuesday evening. Multiple stages, 23 songs and we were up dancing to each one. LOVE that they had the stationary bikes, kinetic mat, etc generating energy to run the concert. I LOVE COLDPLAY. Can't wait to see them in concert again. Funtastic time, the vibe of the crowd was overwhelming happiness."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I couldn't ask for more. Even we the heat, the concert was everything I expected to be and so much more. The band had an incredible energy and stage. They even wrote a special song for Tampa."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Coldplay was amazing! First time seeing them! Absolutely an electrifying performance and show! If you ever get a chance to see them you should! Worth it and would see them again!

The opener H.E.R. was not good. Her mic was off , her instruments didn’t sound like they were sound checked correctly. Way off especially compared to Coldplay. It just didn’t make sense to have her as the opener. The sounds , songs and everything just didn’t work and a lot of people left their seats."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Hi! I'm 19, and I thought i ""wasn't a big enough fan of Coldplay"" to see them, and I was wrong. Despite only knowing their most popular songs, this was a DO NOT MISS event, and completely worthy of seeing. I am so glad I did it, and despite probably not being a huge a fan as the millennials going to see Coldplay, I also grew up with them and it was amazing"
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,It was wild. When it started it got a little out of control because everyone was pushing others to see the band but overall it was the best concert!!
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Went to the Tampa show.  This might have been one of the best shows I have gone to.  I had seen them once before in Kansas City and thought that was amazing, this was over the top EXCELLENT.  This is coming from a huge Peter Gabriel/ Genesis Fan who really enjoys the staging and lighting.  This is a MUST SEE show."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,I have never gone to a concert by myself so I was a little curious how seeing ColdPlay would be especially down on the floor. The experience itself was refreshing no matter how hot and humid it was. I had one of the highlights of my life being able to see ColdPlay before me and an experience I would gladly re-live all over again and again.
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay definitely the best band in the world!! They made a lovely night to remember and I wish more concert to come
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,The best concert experience ever. My second Coldplay concert. They just keep getting better. The music and special effects all come together.
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Concert was perfect. Coldplay did excellent. Even though I was sad, they made me forgot my problems and enjoy the spectacular show."
6/19/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"It was a hot night at Raymond James Field. Expectation were high before the concert was to start at 7 PM but having to wait over 2 hours past the starting time until Coldplay took the stage, listening to 2 opening acts, made it difficult to rate this concert experience any higher. For the LED wristbands to reach their maximum effect, I realize they needed darkness and thus the after 9 PM start for Coldplay, but if the announced start time would have been 8 PM instead of 7 PM, we could have better used that time instead of listening to two acts that do not compliment Coldplay.  Once Coldplay started the 1st 60 minutes was one of the best concert experiences but the last 60 minutes was dull. A couple of times they had to restart songs and then near the end, a couple talked their way on to the stage so that the gentleman could propose awkwardly. The 2nd 60 minutes did not provide the energy of the 1st 60 minutes and seemed like the band just wanted the night to end."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"From the security, organization, the sound, the lights effect and tha band performance. My friends and I agree that this has been the best concert we have ever seen. I had a lot of complications with my travel, lodging and everything but I would go through everything all over again just to see them!"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"This is my third Coldplay concert, and they were great as usual.  Their live sound combined with the wristbands make it an amazing experience every time.  The only thing I would change is taking the puppet gimmick out and playing Coloratura, but that’s splitting hairs.  If you have the chance to see these guys when they do their second leg, seize the opportunity"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I have been going to concerts for the past 20 years all over the state of Florida!  Never did we had to wait 2 hours to get picked up by a share ride!  This is due to the extremely bad organization at the stadium!  Coldplay was awesome, one of the best performances, however the exit/dismissal system that the Raymond James stadium has almost ruined our experience!  We will never attend another concert there!!"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The concert musically & spiritually had so much to offer.. I appreciate you enlightening your audience & the younger generations to pending environmental issues. I’m elated your band chose to remain together, as a group you have so much offer.
My only critique is Chris, easy on the F bomb..please DRock"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,Coldplay was amazing I would see them a millions times if I could it’s a must show see. Can’t wait until they come again. Hope they don’t take so much time for their come back to Florida!
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"I really enjoy the concert it was a perfect , the sound, the energy, the venue. 

The only thing that i was not happy was the organization with the Uber pick up & drop off it was a disaster. And another thing was the mini bag / purse rule at the Stadium. I was with medium purse and i was already there when the tell us about this rule. For next time it would great to hace that kind of info in advance."
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,so fun!!! definitely one of the best concerts i’ve ever been to. they made us put our phones away so we can all just vibe to Viva La Vida and it was one of the best experiences ever
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"Been waiting years for Coldplay to play in Florida again. For me, it was a ""can't miss"" show. After seeing it, they are now a ""can't miss"" band. The concert was absolutely phenomenal.
If I could go again tomorrow, I would. Such a positive energy throughout the whole show. Visual effects were stunning. Quite possibly the best concert I've ever attended!"
6/20/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,"The show and Chris Martin was fantastic with plenty of visual pleasures with everyone having a synced color changing wristband, to fireworks, to confetti and the whole package.

Raymond James (from the 200 club section perspective) is AWFUL. Sounded like noise and hurt my ears...I've been to many...many shows but anything inside a stadium or even worse, inside all together for this type of music turns out awful.

Coldplay and many other artists who put on energetic shows need locations where music doesn't bounce back and reverberate off every wall around. 

3 stars out of 3 for the band (Coldplay) 0 of 2 for the venue (Raymond James)"
6/22/22,Raymond James Stadium - Tampa,All I can say is that Coldplay performance had me with goosebumps and with so much tears of excitement? Very good show definitely grab your seats and enjoy the show!
7/17/22,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"this is not the last coldplay concert i will be attending!
i'm a concert junkie myself and i must say this is easily top 3 artists/bands i've ever heard live.

constructive criticism though.... let's not do it at the ""legendary""rose bowl; their parking system and staff are unprepared and chaotic. other than that, based purely on the band's performance and production, i'd rate it a 10/10. based on venue alone and vendors: 1.5 out of 10."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Was the best concert that I ever went. Was so magic and powerful, I have no words to explain that night. I always loved Coldplay and now after the concert I love even more. 
I had an amazing an incredible experience and I can’t wait to go again one day. 
Thanks Coldplay."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"What else can I say but,  another great Coldplay concert!!  This is the third time seeing them in California,  first time ever being at the Rose Bowl.  What a stadium, over 100 years old, but still a great venue."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Finally got the chance to experience them live, and they sure know how to raise the bar when it comes to live performances. 
Everything went exactly as planned/scheduled, and I'm sure everyone can agree that it was one of the best nights ever!"
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Wow 5 stars is an understatement i have been waiting for years to go to a coldplay show and it was beyond amazing and i will never forget it. It was truelly a dream come true
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Seeing Coldplay was a fun experience! It was a very cool concert overall, especially since I attended on 10/1, when Selena Gomez came out to perform Let Somebody Go. However, the Rose Bowl stadium seats are SO cramped with less leg room than an Economy airline seat & no cupholders. AND, they didn’t even give us the light-up bracelets because they “ran out,” like they have no idea how many tickets they sold? You would think they would have bought enough to have in stock for both shows at the Rose Bowl. So, that was disappointing for me to not have a bracelet. We also left about 2 songs early so we wouldn’t have to wait in a huge line getting out of the parking lot. I would see Coldplay again, if the tickets were cheaper. $250 pp is a lot, & the venue just didn’t meet that price standard."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Finally was able to witness the magic of Coldplay. Worth the drive and chaos to get there. An experience I have been looking forward to for almost a year, loved it"
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,It was an incredible experience. You don't know how much you need to be here until you are experiencing the concert.  It truly leaves you with a smile and if you are ARMY you'll specially enjoy it.
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"One of the best concerts I’ve been too. The lights, the energy, the crowd just made it that much more awesome. The only thing I’d change is the venue."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"I enjoy concerts and live music, but this experience was something else. Coldplay was on my bucket list for so long and finally happened. I waited a year and half, traveled across the Ocean from the Caribbean to be enjoyed one of the best concerts in my life. Coldplay was people centric, timeless music, great atmosphere, everyone was so happy and having a great time. Chris focus on send love, good vibes and a message of inclusion and sense of wonder. Everything was so organized. I am so grateful for this moment. Let’s keep sending shots of awe!"
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Horrible way to see our favourite band!
Show was great but everything else was a huge bother. Bad bleacher seating (spacing too small!), difficult traffic scenarios, and no wine for sale? It was a hot mess."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay never disappoints!  The Fireworks and the lasers and the floating stars and butterflies just added to all the eye candy!  The music was amazing and so many good old favorites.
I was thrilled they played my all time fav. - Fix you!"
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Excellent concert, still can't get over it. the only problem was the parking. That was horrible, but the concert made  me forget about the traffic and parking."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Coldplay is surely spectacular and colorful.  Chris surely can captivate his audience. The whole show is super fun and he surely can make a fan dream’s come true by actually going out of his way to sing to her one on one. Simply an amazing experience. I love artist like him.
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,This is everything i expected and more i can now remove this from my bucket list but i want to one day do it again for sure!
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The concert was amazing and lively. The atmosphere was great and the songs reminded me of why I fell in love with Coldplay.
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay by far in my opinion are one of the best of not the best  concert performers! Given I was able to see Taylor Swift and Beyoncé this year as well, Coldplay had the better concert environment and performance. All the artist above are all amazing in their respective genres, however the crowd environment for Coldplay was welcoming and friendly. It felt more like a gathering of 60 thousand plus strangers becoming friends for a few hours.

100% would watch them again and would advise everyone to experience a Coldplay concert at least once in their lifetime. They are just that good!"
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The show was great, the staffing was terrible outside the event. I can't imagine what it would have been like in an emergency situation, but I saw very few personnel from the massive parking area up to the gates and those that we did see were absolutely clueless about the queuing process or any other event management details. The exit from parking was a disaster as well with grou ds personnel waving sticks any which way while reading their phones."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Musically speaking it was awesome and fun! We had a blast! LOVE COLDPLAY!!! Great concert and performance! 
In terms of organization at Rose Bowl, please add signs (big and plenty) for people to know entrances and exits; there was a lot of confusion that make people more anxious."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Whatever lengths and distance you have to travel to see Coldplay, DO IT!! Our second time and we took a cross country flight, worth every second and every penny!!! The atmosphere, the energy….they are truly the best concert I’ve ever seen. More than once :)"
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The concert was unbelievable, best concert I’ve been to. Had been waiting a while especially after last year’s cancellation, but totally worth the wait. Not only coldplay’s performance, but the whole crowd it was great.

I dont have any improvements to suggest for the concert itselft but I do want to suggest a better organization in the lines to enter. They send emails telling people to arrive super early, but once you get there, there is no one that caln really guide you to the line, or you best way to enter. Also they cut the lines and move them and there is no one to tell you where the line starts and ends. There should be staff in the end of every line with a sign or something saying line ends here so you know where to go. 

Couldn’t put less than 5 stars due to the concert, coldplay is just amazing, the vibe, the show, the songs, everything."
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Seats at the rose bowl looked like a good view from everywhere! Coldplay is amazing as expected! Can’t wait to see them again, a must see once in your life or more if you have patience for the hectic parking 😉 besides that Coldplay was an absolute dream to see and I’m so grateful for their music 🩷"
9/24/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"This concert was like a healing experience, not only were the openers dope but Coldplay came on and reminded me that I’m alive. Thank you Coldplay!!!"
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,Rose Bowl was packed! 68K people in the house. Everyone received a Xyloband. This wristband lights up in multi color synchronized with the music of Coldplay. It was really a spectacular concert . Everyone was on their feet for about 95% of the entire concert. It was the best show ever!
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,My daughter fainted in the beginning of the show thank you to the first responders and the workers that helped us. They did an amazing job. We went back to the concert and she started feeling ill again so we left and went to the ER. She ok now
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"Coldplay was a concert on my bucket list and it’s been checked off. They didn’t disappoint. It was hands down one of the best concerts, the atmosphere. everything was amazing."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The concert was great. This is a review of the parking. The parking situation was the worst I have experienced. There were no lines to mark the parking spots nor did they open the other way or road but instead had everyone funnel out. It took over 3 hours to get outside of the parking area let alone the slow crawl to the street which had more traffic. Please open the roads. There was barely any personnel directing traffic
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,"The performance itself was great. The lights, fireworks, effects and music were great. Coldplay had great stage presence. The not so great stuff had more to do with the venue. The parking situation and lines seemed unorganized. There various lines leading to the entrance and no clear indication of which was the correct line. The wait for restroom was 40+ minutes.There was no cut-off for excessive drinking. There were 3 drunk men in the row behind us that were being unruly. They already tipsy when we got to our seats and they kept drinking through out the night. I felt unsafe and their behavior was a disturbance. One of them fell on us and knocked my sister to the ground. Only reason it wasn’t my pregnant friend on ground was cause she switched seats with my sister."
9/25/23,Rose Bowl - Pasadena,The whole concert was amazing!! Coldplay is amazing & talented & I loved that they interact with the audience. The energy & lights & fireworks was all just well presented! Unforgettable night (:
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The Coldplay concert was magical. All the lights combined with the crowds energy was amazing. They put on such an incredible experience.
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The concert itself was Amazing!  The VIP seats were awful.  People who bought other seats were crowding the bottom of the stands.  Never again will I be purchasing seats like these.  Totally not worth the money spent.
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"If there’s anything that could beat this experience? It’d be another Coldplay live show. They leave their soul on stage, connect with fans, protect the planet, raise awareness about social justice, and definitely do their magic to make the show a lifetime experience. What a combo! It was absolute paradise. I considered the show like my 50th Bday party since I could not celebrate it because I’d recently lost my mom. I had the bestest time of my life. My sign didn’t catch Chris’ attention so I could join them on stage, but that was OK, I wanted the show to last forever."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The show was amazing, we love these guys!!! We got into the Venue smoothly and it is very nice, the food and drink options were great. The one thing we could see an improvement on would be exiting the Venue, we were at the very back of the parking and it felt like their was no movement for an hour. It seemed that there should have been another route to exit from."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay was AMAZING! The whole atmosphere of everything. I liked how a free trolly ride was optional. Getting into the concert was a breeze, did not have any issues when it came to getting into the stadium and leaving. Definitely would see Coldplay again, there concert is something I feel everyone should have the opportunity to see."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,This was the first time I saw Coldplay - although I’ve loved them for years. Wow. I loved every second of their show. and it’s definitely one of my favorite concerts ever. The LED bracelets- amazing - and the dedication to saving the climate is simply incredible and admirable. I LOVED this show.
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I’ve been going to Coldplay concerts since 2005 so I’m a fan, but this is one of their best concerts ever! Chris M’s joy, enthusiasm, and humility are so infectious that you can’t help feeling the same way! They played all their best work, and sprinkled new music here and there. I loved the lit wristbands, the fireworks, and especially the finale with the choir from South Africa. What an amazing show!! I’m already waiting for their new music and next tour."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay has been in my bucket list for a while and was finally able to make it to their concert. I gotta say, it was an amazing experience! The show is extremely well produced, so much energy and it's clear they enjoy performing and interacting with the public... Only downside is that the show was a bit short for what I have seen in other concerts, but still worth it!"
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,We celebrated our 30th anniversary at this concert. It was over the top! Every song was beautiful! They are so talented and put on an awesome show. We love Coldplay and would recommend their music to everyone.
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,Coldplay put on a stunning visual concert.  The wristbands made the experience immersive and the show was spectacular.  The new album started off the show and set the tone for the thousands in attendance to experience a great communal celebration of this world.  There was a clear message that we all need to be part of the solution.
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay at Snap(rape)Dragon Stadium was OK. We were pretty far up in the stands. They seemed to pump in a lot of their music. The music meshed in together with all songs. My fav was Clocks.
How can security let you walk through the metal detectors with a phone in your hand, then let you keep walking, what if I had a gun in my boot? Security should be much tighter."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The venue was awesome!  The concert was amazing!  By far the best concert I’ve ever been to!  I was very impressed.  Love Coldplay and what they stand for.  They really have it together!  Chris Martin is great!  Can’t wait to go to another one of their concerts!
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This was my third Coldplay show and I LOVED IT!  It was so good, I’m still listening to the playlist. I’m still walking on cloud nine.  Please come back sooner than 5 years."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"This is more than a concert. It is an experience. Coldplay has remastered what it means to be at a concert. Performing among massive, sold out crowds, Coldplay ensures every minute you are there watching them is filled with joy, entertainment, and love. Additionally, they have made significant efforts to reduce the carbon footprint through recycling programs and reusable energy efforts. The only negative is every concert you see after this one will never measure up."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"It was the best concert of my life, Coldplay it's my favorite band since 14 years old, but I'm so sad because my wristband didn't turn on."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"They are the best band in the whole world, their show is completely amazing, this show is a must in your life even if you are not a fan"
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Seeing Coldplay live will always be an experience I'll never forget. I wated to see them back in 2017 when they came to SD (I live in Tijuana), but I could not afford to buy tickets. So, in 2021 I was finally able to buy tickets for L.A., but sadly it was cancelled. Before they cancelled, I was still trying to figure out how I was going to get there since I didn't have a driver's license, so the way I saw it was ""Ok, it's fine. They knew you needed to get your life together still, so they're giving you some time and I bet when they release new dates it will be in SD instead, and it'll be better for you, it'll be closer"". And that's what happened: I got my driver's license, car and they announced new dates for SD, which made me think, ""That's how wholesome they are! THANK YOU!"". And just as I expected, it was worth every single day. Their shows are really out of this world."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"The Coldplay concert was nothing short of a spectacular experience. As the music filled the air, the audience became an enchanting spectacle themselves, thanks to the synchronized light-up wristbands that accompanied the performance. It was an unforgettable, immersive journey that left an indelible mark.

Coldplay's ability to involve the crowd was a testament to their showmanship. With each iconic hit, the entire arena transformed into a massive choir, singing in unison. The energy in the venue was electrifying, and it felt like a collective celebration of their timeless music.

This show was a testament to Coldplay's status as one of the world's greatest live bands. Their passion and connection with the audience were palpable throughout the night. The anticipation for the next opportunity to witness such a remarkable performance is already building – I can't wait to see them again."
9/25/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Went with my 17 yr old son- love bands that span generations! Such a fun show, what an iconic band performance! The light show was fantastic, energy was high, and interaction with the audience was so fun! Chris Martin provided an unparalleled engagement opportunity to a couple up on stage in addition to keeping a promise from last year of having someone singing a song with him on stage! Just so cool to see the guys in person. Would 100% go again if I get the opportunity. And of course I could listen to Chris Martin's voice any time!!"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,This is the second time seeing Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres. Both times I traveled out of state to be a part of this magical musical experience! I don’t think I can ever get bored or tired of seeing this band perform live. Shout out to Snapdragon Stadium! Great venue!
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"I had the best time ever. The atmosphere/vibe was amazing! If you have not already seen Coldplay, you absolutely need to!!"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Fabulous concert experience as always with Coldplay ✨Music of the Spheres World Tour was filled with amazing energy, giant colorful balloon globes, a sea of confetti and shared voices from around the world! Incredible! Thank you, Coldplay 🌎🩷❤️🧡💛💚🩵💙💜 #ColdplaySanDiego"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,The Coldplay concert was one of the best I have ever attended. Loved the use of multiple stages and the continuous light show throughout the concert.  The music was excellent!  The venue access was poor.  The traffic between the access highway and the stadium parking was a free for all with little to no police or traffic controllers.  The constant cutting in traffic lines made it impossible to exit off of highway I-15 on to Friers Rd.  I will not attend another concert at Snapdragon until they learn to manage their access to the stadium. It took 1 1/2 hours to exit the highway and get to the parking lot.
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay never disappoints in my opinion, I have been following the MOTSWT since they started and was excited to see them and have the same experience all Coldplay fans were having. Thank you for giving us the best of You!"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"2nd time seeing Coldplay and as usual they did not disappoint! It’s always such a pleasure seeing the guys and it’s always such a joyful occasion. With HER being their front act as well it was like you paid for 2 of the best artist in 1. Me as an ARMY as well, them performing My Universe with BTS on the big screen makes all Coldplay/BTS ARMY heart happy! Thank you Coldplay for such an AWESOME show!"
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay has done amazing shows that go all out with confetti, fire, fireworks, lights...etc. What I love the most is that they care to make their tour sustainabile and try to cut down on their emissions. Love they let people bring in reusable water bottles to refill and they have a stationary bike for people to ride to convert to energy for the show."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"Coldplay is amazing live. If you ever have the chance to see them, take it. Even if you only like one song. You’ll be happy you went by the end of the night. I guarantee it."
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,I think everyone needs to attend a Coldplay concert at least once in their life. I’ll be jumping at the next opportunity to watch again! 🌟
9/26/23,Snapdragon Stadium - San Diego,"What an incredible show! The lights, the production, the environmentally friendly aspect, the sound quality, the intimate feeling despite being a huge stadium, we loved it all!!"
9/26/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,"What can I say, simply amazing!! I first saw Coldplay in 2016 when they came to Indianapolis.  I had such an amazing time, I knew I just had to see them the next chance I got.  Went to see them this year in Chicago at Soldier Field, which by the way was awesome b/c it was open and you had a view of the skyline plus fireworks.   Both tours they give you wristbands that light up to the beats of the songs.  They had kinetic bikes and dance pads so the crowd could use and it that helped provide energy for their shows. They are such awesome performers, great songs, and overall a great group of guys.  If you get the chance, go see them, I promise you won't regret it!"
9/26/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,"Exciting show and entertaining, but it was very obvious those in charge of sound had not gotten out from behind their headphones, because the speaker sound was incredibly bad. I've been to other shows where speakers end up bursting, and this sounded very close to that. Really was a MAJOR distraction to the show."
9/26/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,"I bought a ticket to see Coldplay by myself for their show in Chicago on the 28th of May. I had such a GREAT time that I decided to purchase a ticket for their show on the 29th. I’m glad that I did, this experience was so surreal. Definitely one of the best concerts that I’ve EVER been to"
9/26/23,Soldier Field - Chicago,"The light show was amazing! It was like a big EDM party with lights flashing, pyrotechnics, and Chris Martin's insatiable energy. They played for over 2 hours on 2 stages and Lupe Fiasco joined them to sing 2 songs. Opener H.E.R. seemed off rhythm with her guitar but first opener Drama was an amazing Soul singer. Venue was so-so, but seeing Coldplay for the first time in 20 years was very different than the first 2 smaller venues I saw them at. Good that they're trying to keep up though."
