"This lamp comes unassembled but is easy and fun to snap the arms into the central pieces. I ordered ""warm oak"" but what I received is not at all the light honey tone I was expecting from the photo, but it is nice anyway. Looks great with a decorative Edison-style LED bulb. Very fast shipping and response.",-,-
"I can't  speak more highly of the wonderful service and communication from this Etsy shop. Well packaged with detailed instructions. I would highly  recommend purchasing from Dezaart. Have yet to put shade together and install, will include a photo later. Thank you Anthanasios for your professionalism. üôè",-,-
"LOVE the fixture. High quality and the shadow design it leaves is beautiful. 

The videos showing how to assemble the fixture and connect it was very helpful.  A few challenges‚Ä¶1) the ground wire install had zero instructions and the wire was too small 2) on the assembly instructions step 6 did not apply, perhaps the design has changed? 3) as other people wrote, it is tricky to install each piece and until you get the hang of it, I broke one by using too much force. Thankfully you all sent an extra piece or two.",-,2023-12-17T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Wow! Wow! Wow‚Ä¶. Fantastic from beginning to end! Super quick delivery from Greece to UK.. packaged extremely well and the quality and craftsmanship is superb and finally the instructions for both the build and installation were perfect.

What more is there to say, except THANK YOU, great to support a small business offering great engineered products.",-,-
"Beautiful piece at a great price,  fast shipping and excellent communication/customer service. Easy to put together (after watching the how-t video üòä). Haven‚Äôt hung it yet, but it will look fab when I do!",-,-
I just had the pendant light installed over my dining table and it looks just perfect.   It also was pretty quick to assemble and I was careful when doing it so had no issues with breakage.  So I'm looking forward to enjoying it every day!,-,-
"A couple of the tines/fins arrived broken (typical FedEx), and the guys shipped out replacements super quick. Very responsive and helpful all the way. Very nicely made light fixture and dead simple to install. Thank you again!!!",-,-
"Very beautiful chandelier, be careful it is very fragile especially at the level of the hoops so to assemble with care taking your time
There are 3 extra hoops just in case.",-,2023-12-16T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Love it! 
We we had been searching for quite a while for a unique shade that we both loved... my only concern being, if one of the slats ever breaks, I hope we can order replacements, as the replacements that came with it (thankyou) we had to use, this was due to glue being on some of the slats, however we love this so much.",-,-
"Love this chandelier! Ours came with some damaged pieces. The seller was very responsive and luckily sent me 3 extra pieces. We ended up needing all of them because more were damaged when we hung it. While this is a beautiful piece of work, IT IS FRAGILE. The video makes it look really easy to snap in but the pieces are very delicate so take your time! All in all we love it and happy with the purchase!",-,-
"So pleased with the two shades I ordered. Arrived quickly, well packaged and easy to assemble and hang. Such an unusual and quirky design which has been admired by everyone who has seen it.",-,-
"The lamp corresponds fully to the description. The assembly was problem-free. The YouTube instructions are an excellent source of assistance.
A wonderfully stylish and, above all, individual addition to our newly designed bedroom. We recommend!",-,-
"This is our second light and just like the first time, this didn‚Äôt disappoint. Came packed carefully and was easy to put together. The seller reached out pretty quickly to confirm the order and ask questions regarding customization.",-,-
"Quick delivery and item exactly as described. Very helpful with responding to questions prior to purchase. 
Directions for assembly clear and easy to follow. 
Spare parts included with order and a surprise gift made it extra special.",-,-
This light is elegant and unique. Lighter in color than the photos and very light weight. Easy to assemble and as other reviews mentioned it is very fragile. Surprisingly arrived quickly to the US from Greece and with zero damage. Really enjoying the look!,-,2023-09-16T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Beautiful! Received the item in a timely manner, we love it!  There is a bit more assembly than i expected, and one of the wood pieces broke when I was putting it together but they included extra pieces for that reason, so it all worked out.  The light is beautiful!",-,2023-09-07T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Gorgeous item. Arrived very quickly. Only took about 10 minutes to put together, and the pieces weren't as fragile as I had expected from other reviews. The veneer came off one piece when I removed the tape holding the bundles together (only slightly), but the maker had included some spare pieces, which was brilliant. I didn't use the rose and cable supplied as I have swag fittings, but the shade fitted perfectly with a reducing ring. My next door neighbour has already asked where I got my beautiful light from. Would definitely buy from this seller again.",-,2023-09-06T00:00:00.0000000Z
LOVE this lamp so much!!! It's such a unique addition to our living room. The cast shadows are amazing and really set a tone for the space.  Super easy to assemble and install (with great instructions).,-,2023-08-29T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Fixture shipped sooner than expected & packaged well.

Putting the fixture together was also relatively easy & extra pieces were included. 

Definitely happy with the purchase! :)",-,2023-08-27T00:00:00.0000000Z
"This is a stunning lampshade and, now it's assembled, I am happy. However, the individual wooden arms are very very delicate and despite being very careful, I managed to break the 'tab' from 3 of them!!! There were 2 spares, so it can't just be me. I managed to glue the tab that fell off that was left, but be careful!!! Even more careful than me!",-,2023-08-18T00:00:00.0000000Z
"It‚Äôs beautiful, but be very careful when connecting the pieces. It is pressed wood so it can snap easily. I just glued my broken piece back on because it would be $30 shipping for the small piece needed.",-,2023-08-13T00:00:00.0000000Z
Gorgeous light fittings really pleased with how they look and arrived really quickly too. I was a bit daunted when I saw all the pieces in the box but so easy to assemble and the instructions are very clear.,-,2023-08-01T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Update:
The company reached out and refunded me roughly 50% of the lamp cost.

Unfortunately most of the wood pieces had scuffs on them near the gold buttons. I needed a light fixture and didn't have time for returning the damaged product nor did I want to pay for the return shipping. 

The wood pieces are very thin, and didn't line up great when assembling that the notches broke on a few of the wood legs. 

All in all once hanging it looks nice but would not buy this again.",-,2023-07-30T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Beautiful quality product!!! Great packaging.
The instructions for assembly were not so easy to follow but I appreciated the youtube link which made it super clear. I am in love with this light fixture.",-,2023-07-21T00:00:00.0000000Z
The light has flimsy material. It breaks easily and assembly wasn‚Äôt easy. Also I can tell they removed the previous trim and added the gold trim that I wanted. There are many scratches and I would like to return this product,-,-
"Perfect for our cottage !! Touch of modern to add to rustic look of our dinning room . I am stunned at the speed item was received !! Are you a Magician ?? My husband is pretty good at putting things together as he is an Industrial Designer an Artist . He said A+ on shipping, packinging and instructions . So happy!!  I have been waiting to get rid of our sad old light fixture!!! Cheers to you and your staff .",-,2023-07-17T00:00:00.0000000Z
A really lovely item that looks stunning in place. Well packaged to avoid any damage in transit and a little tricky to construct but well worth it. Excellent comms and quick response times. Buy with confidence.,-,2023-07-17T00:00:00.0000000Z
Beautiful! Absolutely matched the description and exceeded our expectations.  DEZAART was very helpful when I had questions about construction and even sent me replacement pieces when I broke one.  Highly recommend.,-,2023-07-04T00:00:00.0000000Z
Unbelievably beautiful light! Shipping was only 4 days - from Greece! It was very easy to assemble especially with the suggested YouTube link. The two extra pieces were not needed but appreciated. The two small bonus cutouts were a beautiful surprise and will hang on my Christmas tree. You won‚Äôt go wrong ordering one of their gorgeous lights! Highly recommend in all categories.,-,2023-06-21T00:00:00.0000000Z
Love my lights but not easy to put together like the video shows ! 4 pieces were broken & I broke 3 putting it together. Very flimsy but do look great when done,-,2023-06-18T00:00:00.0000000Z
"This light is awesome. Beautiful and easy to put together. The regular size is perfect above my dining table (table is 40"" x 80"" for reference). Love it! I'm glad there were a couple extra pieces included in case any break. 

It would be great to see an option that's thin plywood instead of MDF.",-,2023-06-13T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Very difficult to put together, I had to use a small file to make the slots bigger to put the fixture together.I bought 2 of these fixtures and they did send some extra pieces which i had to use because they do break easily when you try to force fit the pieces. You definitely need some patients putting this fixture together but once you are done it is amazingly beautiful!",-,2023-06-06T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Beautiful rendering, very good overall quality! The distribution of shapes on the ceiling and on the walls is really very beautiful and I love its half-Nordic, half-spider design.
4 stars because the manual is not very clear, I had mounted the parts on the wrong disc and I broke some when removing them. Watch the youtube video before editing, not like me, and everything will be easier üôÇ
Fortunately the seller is attentive, responsive and solved my little problem at lightning speed! 6 stars for customer service üôÇ",-,2023-06-11T00:00:00.0000000Z
"This is a beautiful light!!! It was well packed and labeled fragile and with extra parts if needed. The install was simple enough with the video instructions for a total novice, however there wasn‚Äôt much instruction on what to do with the ground wire. Also the video tutorial are featuring different parts than what I received so there was some guess work. 

Overall this is a beautiful piece and I would recommend it!",-,2023-05-27T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Love this!  What a change in the way our dining area looks!  Comes as a puzzle that you have to put together, and thankful for extra pieces because tips broke off but we repaired them!  Exactly as described and arrived so quickly!  It was wonderful!  Bought an amber light for it in one of the old fashioned styles, looks amazing!  The shadows that are cast are soooo great!  Delighted and would happily buy more from this seller!",-,2023-05-23T00:00:00.0000000Z
"I received my light yesterday and was extremely excited. The video instructions were very good to help me put it together and the light once assembled is really stunning. However the only thing I was a bit surprised about is that the individual arms that you have to slot into a rose disc when assembling, are very thin and fragile and one clumsy move when putting it together, can make them break where they clip in. Luckily they send 2 extra arms and I needed both. I am now a little afraid it may get damaged when it is fitted by our electrician and I must admit I am wondering how I am going to dust it in the future without the risk of damaging it. Once assembled it is more sturdy as all the components support each other, but it is still a big concern of mine. I would hate it to break. 
I was expecting it to be more solid/robust.",-,2023-05-20T00:00:00.0000000Z
"The pendant is strikingly beautiful, but fragile. Assembly isn‚Äôt too bad‚Ä¶ I assembled the pendant upside down to reduce the stress on the pieces as they are extremely flimsy. I appreciate the YouTube video assembly guide because my directions appear misprinted. I had communication with the seller prior to purchasing and they were excellent in answering all of my question. As another review mentioned, there is an odor noticeable fresh out of the box but I assume it‚Äôll fade in a few days. I‚Äôm glad the sellers include additional pieces, because two arrived broken. Not severely, they could be glued back together, but would be noticed if repaired. I appreciate the length of the ceiling cord and cup. Overall, I would purchase from this shop again and I am pleased with the pendant!",-,2023-05-12T00:00:00.0000000Z
It is very pretty mounted. I arrive early and they accommodated my request for cable length. easy to assemble It remains to be seen how it behaves with time and cleaning. I haven't had a chance to install it yet.,-,2023-05-09T00:00:00.0000000Z
"I love the way the lamp is supposed to look, but the pieces will not fit into part A, and in fact part of the circle broke while we were trying to put the lamp together. Then when we did get them all together the C pieces actually weren‚Äôt all the way in & wouldn‚Äôt go any further so piece B couldn‚Äôt go on. 
Sadly we‚Äôre going to have to return it.",-,-
"WE LOVE IT!

A little bit of a faff to get put together, but extra sections are included for this. Only make it up when you are ready to instal it are my words of wisdom as it doesn‚Äôt like to travel in one piece made up.

The correspondence and delivery of the item were exceptional!

The shade it‚Äôs self looks incredible!",-,2023-04-18T00:00:00.0000000Z

Great quality item. Easy to put together and came with extra pieces for those of us who are rough on assemblage. Everyone compliments it when they walk into the dining room.,-,2023-04-14T00:00:00.0000000Z
"The pendant was better than expected, it suits our dining perfectly.  The lighting effect is excellent and adds a lovely touch to the room.
It came quite quickly considering how far it had to travel, was very well packed, and even came with a cpl of spare pieces.
Very happy, would thoroughly recommend.",-,2023-04-11T00:00:00.0000000Z
Amazingly beautiful chandelier! The craftsmanship and care clearly shows. 2 pieces lost their glue but luckily there were replacement ones. Bravo to the creator!,-,2023-04-05T00:00:00.0000000Z
I had some problems with the assembly but customer service was superlative. I contacted them and they offered me a full refund or any item from their catalog. They are sending me a table lamp which I wait with anticipation. The lampshade itself now looks great in situ and I am enjoying it very much. Thank you so much guys for your excellent service. I would not hesitate to recommend you to anyone.,-,2023-04-04T00:00:00.0000000Z
"This light is stunning. It was a total surprise. The light came quickly all the way from Greece to Canada in just a short week. The pieces are sturdy. There‚Äôs definitely a smell once you unpack it. It goes away but you should be aware it takes time for sure to air out. Assembly of the light itself  was not nearly as easy as the videos show. If the pieces are not in the EXACT position it will not snap together. Lots of patience is required. The very last piece was so difficult to snap into place because my hands couldn‚Äôt allow for the pressure necessary and at that point you‚Äôre afraid you‚Äôre going to break the light in two. We put the light up first without the shade, and then screwed the shade on after it was hanging. That way there was no risk to the shade getting knocked around during install. It‚Äôs breathtaking!",-,2023-04-03T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Great lamp, but a bit hard to put together. My first attempt failed, but the seller helped me by sending a different design free of charge. I'd definitely buy from them again.",-,2023-03-29T00:00:00.0000000Z
Fantastic product. Looks exactly like the photos. Fast delivery. I am so excited to get this installed. It will look perfect in my new mid century inspired kitchen/dinning room.,-,2023-03-27T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Great design, easy assembly. Would have liked a longer cord (not sure if this was an option). Using as a dining room light. Without a diffuser (or dimmer switch, witch I latter added) the direct view to the bulb is a bit off putting. I am overall happy with the lamp!",-,-
"Design is very cool itself, assembling was fine, take your time, line up the slates to make it easier. I installed it super slow, but they included 2 extra pieces just in case one breaks. An Edison bulb looks very cool, but honestly I think any bulb works well with this. Be sure to provide length you would like for the cord, or else you‚Äôll have to cut it yourself via wire cutter. Screws are small for the metal plate provided, but they fit into the ceiling plate which is what matters the most. There is a grounding wire provided, but no extra screw or bolt to fixate to the metal plate provided (this is needed in addition to the two sets provided to install directly into the ceiling plate). No specific hole in the plate for the grounding wire, usually this is the green screw you see for most lights",-,2023-03-18T00:00:00.0000000Z

"This looks amazing, easy to put together and install Fabulous shadows on the ceiling - looks great. A couple of minor things..... on the instruction sheets picture 1 is a bit confusing as it shows part B, so I started with that - maybe don't even send pic 1. Also the screws were too small for the ceiling bracket and went straight through the slots (even with the washers) - I had to use some larger screws",-,2023-03-07T00:00:00.0000000Z

"These lamps and shades are, simply put, spectacular...  They are beautifully cut, easy enough to put together, and look wonderful.  We are installing two in our new home and I'll add pics once that's complete.  Note, one of the plastic mounting brackets arrived cracked (hairline, but damaged enough to break further upon assembly) and as soon as i notified the owner, he shipped me a new one (and a spare) at no additional cost.  The lamp also came with a few spare wooden ""arms"" incase one broke during assembly.  This was unexpected and unnecessary but it was very nice to have just in case.",-,2023-02-14T00:00:00.0000000Z

"Awesome! Well, I Iove wood, and I love ingenuity! This lamp has both. It creates its own almost retro mood hanging from the black cord with the simple ceiling canopy. I used an Edison bulb with warm light and as you can see in the pics, the shade creates a nice ambiance as the light plays off the walls! Just as advertised! Great design, great quality, very unique, easy to set up and install. (Ok, the install was a little tough as you need to make sure that the pieces fit together tightly... which at first I did not and then over a couple of weeks some of the slats started to droop. But the fix was easy as the shade comes off separately and then I reseated all the slats - perfect now!) Thanks!",-,2023-01-27T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Love this lamp! The shadows from the light threw us off at first (which we should have known would happen, but didn't think about it), but we found it leads your eye to the height of the room and actually makes it look bigger. It also did take some work to cut the cord to make it the length we wanted. If you have never worked with electric, I suggest that this should not be your first go if it. You will also need clear or white electric tape to hold the cord together at the cut, but it is pretty self explanatory once you get into it.",-,2023-01-22T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Product quality not what I expected at this price point. 2 pieces broke on install - thankfully the seller provided 2 extras. Build quality of ceiling fixture unable to support the weight of pendant lamp, so there is a very visible gap between the ceiling and the top of the ceiling fixture where the light fixture looks like it is sagging. I had a certified electrician do the install. 

Shipping delays also but Seller offered another product from his catalogue for free due to the delay, which was excellent. Unfortunately I will not be taking them up on the offer given the poor quality of the item already purchased.",-,2023-01-28T00:00:00.0000000Z
"The suspension could be pretty but the design is not good.
Part A is broken because it does not have enough thickness to support all the elements of the lamp.
Room B is impossible to set up because there are no necessary games.
In conclusion I do not advise the purchase of this lamp.",-,2023-02-03T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Beautiful lamps. I purchased four for my mid-century home within days of finding this shop. Stunning works of art.
The lamps were well-packed and arrived  within 2 weeks, faster than I expected just after the holidays. I'm rather handy, and found the instructions pretty clear and the lamps easy to assemble taking about 15-20 min each. They complement my decor beautifully.",-,2023-01-17T00:00:00.0000000Z
"I love this light!  It's exactly as described, and goes together exactly how the video shows.  So happy I bought the larger size - it finishes off the living room, and it's not heavy-looking because of all the negative space.  Shipping was super quick.  I did have to glue a couple of loose pieces, but that was totally not a big deal.  For those in the US - BROWN is the live wire, Blue is neutral.",-,2023-01-17T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Wow, anyone could be mistaken for being underwhelmed upon opening the light shade and seeing it unassembled, but once it‚Äôs on the ceiling and you turn on the light it‚Äôs quite striking.  The larger option is def recommended, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. 
Shipping took a while from Athens to the UK (approx 2 weeks) but it was worth the wait.  No customs duty or VAT to pay as it was under ¬£135. 
As other people have mentioned, the product is packed with 2 additional wings/arms, whatever you want to call them, in case any break during assembly. We did not need them. The YouTube videos for assembly and installation were adequate enough. I had it rewired and in place in approx 1hr.",-,2023-01-16T00:00:00.0000000Z

"I ordered the 12 x 23in Oak Light and absolutely adore the style, quality, and amazing ceiling light projection this design offers. Very pleased! The build took about 15 min. I am glad there were 3 extra slats provided because I ripped one by accidentally overextending it, so just note this design is fragile. Additionally, the install was a little challenging because the install video provided with the paperwork didn't share how to shorten the hanging cord. But I searched and found it in another one of Dezaart's video libraries. Other than that, very impressed! Looks so good on my angled ceiling!",-,2023-01-08T00:00:00.0000000Z

I was surprised how quickly it arrived after purchasing it.  The assembly was a bit intimidating when we first opened it, but the seller's how-to video on YouTube made it easy.  I did break 2 when trying to click them in place, but the extras provided solved that.  Great quality and great value!  I get a ton of compliments!",-,2023-01-02T00:00:00.0000000Z

Customer service was excellent!  I request my unit to have a corded plug, rather than the hardwired version listed.  Seller accommodated my request, responded quickly to my questions, and arrive within a week.  Highly recommend!",-,2022-12-08T00:00:00.0000000Z

"We needed a new ceiling lamp for our bedroom and discovered this light which became a perfect fit. Throws off nice light and shadows, especially with an Edison Style Bulb. 
Assembly was straight forward with provided instructions. Word of caution when assembling - the fins are fragile, and feel like they are easy to break. Just use the right amount of finesse (push in the direction of the slots)  and you'll have no problem. They do provide 2 extra fins in case of an issue. 
Once I opened the package, I did let the parts breathe / air out for a few days due to the laser cutting burn, which is standard for anything cut with a laser. 
It's a really nice piece and I'd recommend.",-,2022-11-30T00:00:00.0000000Z
Just got mine in and can‚Äôt wait to put it up! We‚Äôre redoing our ceiling and we‚Äôre super excited when we found this light fixture. We were able to shorten it too!,-,2022-11-29T00:00:00.0000000Z
Shipping was quick and the lamp looks absolutely gorgeous. Disappointing to find so many of the pieces damaged. The two spare pieces were also damaged so they didn‚Äôt help. But it is the perfect addition to my living room.,-,2022-11-29T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Fast shipping, easy to put together, an all around great experience for the most part. It looks fantastic. I did accidentally bump the fixture while trying to hang against my ladder and three parts snapped pretty easily. I was able to glue it, no problem. So just a note to buyers to be gentle!",-,2022-11-27T00:00:00.0000000Z
"fantastic piece.

assembled, it's a great presence.

i did break one on the fins while i was assembling it, which caused some anxiety, but, lo, there were two spares in the package.

i have yet to hook it up and hang it, but it will command whichever room i decide to install it in. 

i will probably purchase another.
(shipping was fast considering it came from Greece in 2022!)",-,2022-11-26T00:00:00.0000000Z
"The lights are lovely, matched the description, seller very helpful. But I had to leave a lower rating as I feel it should be flagged that there will be duty to pay as they come from Greece. It‚Äôs fair enough as it‚Äôs due, but an indication of cost would be helpful before the order is confirmed. My duty was nearly ¬£60 for two lights for info delivery to uk",-,2022-11-25T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Just moved into a mid century home and needed a light fixture for the entry way. At first I was intimidated to put it together, but it was easy!
The pieces are light, but no problems putting them together.
I really needed a flush mount but we rewired the cord so it‚Äôs flush with the ceiling.
We both really like it!! So happy I ordered it and it arrived 5 days after I ordered it! From Greece!",-,2022-11-23T00:00:00.0000000Z
The order came quickly and looks just like the picture..several of the pieces broke while assembling but replacement parts were sent out and we are looking forward to enjoying this lamp. It really does make a statement! Thank you for being so easy to work with!,-,2022-11-22T00:00:00.0000000Z

Wow...this light is an absolute SHOWSTOPPER!  To avoid glare I recommend using a half chrome bulb in no less than a 100W bulb so it really projects the beautiful design onto the ceiling and makes it look like fabric!  I would also suggest using a light bulb with a 2700k color as it gives a warm light that compliments the honey-colored wood (a 4000k - 5000k color bulb is too stark and takes away from the effect).  This chandelier looks very high-end and is an absolute bargain that will completely transform any room!  Love it!!!,-,2022-11-17T00:00:00.0000000Z
"This is a such a fantastic light, item description is spot on but it looks even better in real life. It's very well made and the wood veneer looks great. Easy to assemble and makes a fantastic statement when up on the ceiling. Thoroughly recommend  it!! üëç",-,2022-11-14T00:00:00.0000000Z
"I just got the fixture up this weekend! I love it! I went with the smaller (8x19"") fixture but now that I see it hanging I could easily have gone with the larger size, I was afraid it would overwhelm the room but it's so beautiful it deserves to be a focal point. Assembly was easy, the video was super helpful and I didn't break any of the pieces. Installation for anyone installing DIY in the US: the brown wire = black, blue wire = white, there isn't a dedicated ground in the fixture wiring. Use an allen wrench to move the black plastic attachment down the cable to shorten it. It would have been helpful for the installation vid to show this in the US clip, but still easy to figure out. Depending on the bulb used, you either get subtle or extreme shadow patterns when the light is on, I completely love it!!",-,2022-11-13T00:00:00.0000000Z
I had to convince my husband that this would look perfect in our entry way and he didn‚Äôt believe me until we put it up! We love it! The quality is awesome. The item is intricately built and very light!,-,2022-11-12T00:00:00.0000000Z

Gorgeous light fixture and easy to put together. Glad there was two extra slats because I used them. I had an electrician install and shorten the cord for my low ceilings.,-,2022-11-09T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Gorgeous light fixture! Really brings the rooms together. It catches my eye each time I walk in the house.

My shipment arrived well extremely packed, nothing was broken, nor scratched though things came overseas and there are a lot of small pieces that could have broken.

This is not your typical mass produced unit from a big box store, it‚Äôs so nice to buy a hand made piece from true artisans!",-,2022-10-08T00:00:00.0000000Z
The light fixture is absolutely stunning- but I will say that the pieces are VERY fragile. We ended up breaking 2 with just normal pressure and movement. Definitely handle with care if putting together. Luckily it came with 3 extra parts!,-,2022-10-07T00:00:00.0000000Z
"The light fixture arrived much quicker than expected which was great! Some of the pieces arrived broken but we were grateful that extras were provided. Assembly was easy, we were able to complete it without the video tutorial. I can‚Äôt speak to set up, as I had an electrician install. The results are beautiful. Not only is the piece impressive on its own, but it casts a starburst glow on the ceiling and walls that we adore. We splurged for a fancy Edison bulb and it looks great. The seller was very responsive to my initial question prior to purchase. I would happily buy from this seller again.",-,2022-10-06T00:00:00.0000000Z

"Several parts to this review. Received item decently fast. Upon arrival 7-10 of the pieces were broken. Contacted seller, they immediately shipped more pieces out. Received the pieces this time with nothing damaged in shipping. Unfortunately the wrong color was shipped. Not the end of the world, contacted seller again. They apologized and sent replacement pieces as well as another product of my choosing.

EXCELLENT customer service and product. Thank you for the great light fixture!",-,2022-09-30T00:00:00.0000000Z
"This looks like a sculpture hanging from the ceiling, very distinctive and noticeable. I am very pleased with this purchase for my mid-century decor.  However, beware it is extremely fragile and I somehow managed to break two slats while assembling, but fortunately they included two extras for that very reason.  Very good foresight on their part.",-,2022-09-18T00:00:00.0000000Z

"While it‚Äôs well made, it doesn‚Äôt quite snap together as stated. We have it hung, because even though it‚Äôs not 100% as expected, it‚Äôs still a cool lamp. We tried for an hour trying different approaches, from assembling it upside down, to using basic light taps to try and get it lock up. Nothing worked.",-,2022-09-29T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Update: they have been very kind to send me a replacement and partial refund due to mine being broken. The shop is very communicative which I can appreciate. They are also very accommodating which is great. 



The chandelier is very flimsy. Pieces break easily, but they do provide extras. Also, the top attachment piece did not fit perfectly onto the legs, so we just had to put it on top and screw the light pieces on. Overall I‚Äôd give it a 1. This is just a cheap light fixture and the cord is flimsy as well. I also wanted the darker wood one, but apparently I ordered wrong and got the light shaded one.",-,2022-09-15T00:00:00.0000000Z
My pendant light is beautiful. It was easy to put together. Although I did not need the extra pieces I appreciated that they were included. Price was reasonable and it arrived quickly. The instructions were ok but watching the videos really helped.,-,2022-09-10T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Fabulous.  More beautiful than I hoped.  One of the ""blades"" had a tiny nick in it - but the artist/seller sent extras.  It wasn't even noticeable so I will save them in case we need them later.  It's everyone's favorite light in the house and my husband (who didn't think we needed a pendant at the entry inside our home) even came around. Difficult to put together if you just read instructions but VERY VERY EASY if you watch the video.  Probably 15 minutes - and I was being very careful because the wood is delicate.  Years ago I wanted a wood shade for a lamp in my home and had to get it custom-made ($650 US).  It was not this well designed, not this well-made, and didn't survive the move from that home.  If you like the look, buy this!!!",-,2022-09-08T00:00:00.0000000Z

Customer service is impeccable!

The assembled chandelier provides a magnificent light to the room and is simply majestic.

The paint on the cup is a bit textured which feels high-grade compared to some generic, glossy paint.

Beware: Europe wiring and system (blue/brown wires, E27 bulb socket).",-,2022-08-29T00:00:00.0000000Z
"The lamp goes together quick due to smart and efficient design. There are two extra fins in case you break one.  The instructions seem to imply an incorrect order to assembly process starting with Piece A first.  Once I figured out that pieces should snap to B first, it was very easy to set up.  The lamp is a nice blend of unique hand made quality but with precision engineering of its parts.",-,2022-08-28T00:00:00.0000000Z

"I love my new dining room light!

I have bought unusual lighting for our farm. It's a really good way to up your look.

I have kept with 2 themes, industrial (before it was trending) & wood. Yes I stole the wood idea from a forest. üòÅ Lol

I was so excited when it arrived and delivery was surpisingly quick. Putting it together is not difficult (think Tetris). There was one part that was wrong and they gave me options on how to fix it. I have patience, so I said I would wait for the new part.

It was even quicker! The light is now up and it looks super! It almost matches the wood on our ceiling.

I couldn't be happier, both with my new light &, especially, the post-purchase customer care.

I will be a repeat customer when I need to replace our basement lighting. It's all florescent lighting down there! Eeep! Thank you do much.",-,2022-06-14T00:00:00.0000000Z

"I‚Äôd been scouring the internet intensely trying to find a light fixture that was cool, unique, and not aggressively expensive. I found it here!

Shipping: they shipped within a day of my order, and it arrived fairly quickly!

Quality: it is much lighter (as in weight) than I anticipated, which is fine- I‚Äôd rather not have something heavy dangling from my ceiling. The  wood pieces look beautiful quality. One of the pieces did arrive unglued, but they provided an extra or two so this wasn‚Äôt an issue. I ordered the black base, which looks very sleek and you can adjust length to your liking. 

Assembly: my husband put it together, but it seemed to be fairly easy. There is a center piece that has cutouts and each slat fits right in. It‚Äôs actually a pretty cool design!",-,2022-05-20T00:00:00.0000000Z

It's a touch fragile- In moving it to the carton where I needed to store it until the electrician could install , I knocked it against my table and one of the pieces broke. Thank goodness you include a couple spares!  I feel like it is a 2 person job for one to hold the fixture (mine is a larger version) while the other hangs it up, measures the length of cord etc.  BUT - it is very cool looking!! Take some time with hanging and then once it is up you don't need to touch it again! I think it is overall a great MCM vibe putchase!",-,2022-04-28T00:00:00.0000000Z

Seller responded to all questions in an appropriate amount of time. Sent a longer cord on request. Wish the metal finishes could have been a different tone (they are gold).

"5 stars from me, 4 stars from my husband who installed it. Assembly was easy, (I watched the video first and it‚Äôs super intuitive) and I didn‚Äôt have to use the extra pieces they sent. The seller accommodated my request for a longer cord, which was a huge help with our vaulted ceilings. It is a little tricky to get it to hang completely level and the hardware sent for connecting the bulb to the wood pieces didn‚Äôt seem quite right. We improvised and made it work, but that‚Äôs why the 4 stars from my husband! All that said, the piece is beautiful and I love the style. It‚Äôs perfect for over our dining table.",-,2022-03-19T00:00:00.0000000Z
Great communication regarding shipping details. It arrived in perfect condition and was easy to put together. Took me a bit to get it installed as I needed to paint my room/ceiling first. Now it's up. Looks amazing and I get tons of compliments.,-,2022-03-17T00:00:00.0000000Z
"I was really pleased with this light. It's definitely a different material than I was expecting. I was imagining solid wood but that was my own problem, the material and appearance are perfect!",-,2022-03-17T00:00:00.0000000Z
"It is really lovely. And the wood smells so good! Unexpected benefit. 

My 17yo put it together for me and said it was pretty easy to assemble. 

We did not use the hardware to attach the light to the ceiling/connect to a fixture. We just used a plug in pendant light and clamped the cord so it would stay in place. 

I ordered a GE Vintage G40 Globe LED Light Bulb, 60-Watt Replacement, Amber Finish Edison Bulb, Dimmable, from Amazon and it looks great.",-,2022-03-14T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Light was even more beautiful in person. Great price for the size and statement piece you get. Unfortunately the cord provided was faulty and needed to be replaced. Luckily it was cheap and easy to do so, but was a slight inconvenience. Overall still very happy.",-,2022-03-03T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Just as described. Love it! ( It is very fragile. I was grateful for the extra pieces that were included because I broke two pieces when I was putting it together.) 
 Very fast shipping! The light looks great.",-,2022-03-02T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Lovely lamp, outstanding customer service. Couple of items to mention. The colour of the wood was lighter than the picture if honest. Also the ceiling rose was different colour to lamp wood however the seller shipped another immediately and without question. We‚Äôve had several friend comment how lovely it is.",-,2022-02-24T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Stunning designed lampshade, very well made, easy to assemble, lovely finishing. Looks amazing in the room. Very impressed with excellent customer service, quick response, polite and kept me updated throughout all the steps. I would totally recommend to my friends and family to buy from this amazing designer. Thank you. I wish you all the best in the future.",-,2022-02-15T00:00:00.0000000Z
The piece is great and I get a lot of compliments on it. It is very delicate though. Its a good thing they sent two extra pieces because two broke while assembling. But other than that I really love it.,-,2022-02-14T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Good quality, exactly what we wanted. Looks gorgeous in our house. Comes with a strong wood smell but can air out in a day or so. Youtube instructions were very helpful. The electrical part was a bit tricky when it came to the grounding wire but overall, 100% satisfied with the finished product!",-,2022-02-11T00:00:00.0000000Z
"Sad to say I'm very disappointed. 
First delivery was way longer than expected, then the colour was different than what I ordered and it arrived all broken. Be careful with the taxes they didn't warn me about..
They look nice but quality is very very poor. It feels like its going to break at every move...",-,2022-02-11T00:00:00.0000000Z
"I like the looks etc., but the lamp seems very fragile.  The fins are made of MDF (which is stated in the description) and the small tab at the end breaks easily.  It's going to be difficult to clean it.  Maybe a feather duster will be okay.

It matched the description.
Considering the price, it is okay.  It looks really good!",-,2022-02-07T00:00:00.0000000Z
