"The content and the way of teaching are fulfilling but they teach WordPress through a paid partnership so if you don't want to pay you need to find a free hosting service and this makes the learning process extremely difficult for a beginner. Also, the last lectures are not up to date so I'm not sure if I learned Google Ads (and such) or not because they shot these lectures in 2018 (5 years ago!). So overall if you're a beginner find an updated course.","Negative","Course Relevance"

It is not okay and so outdated for digital marketing. It feels like a scam saying it was updated in 2024. I'm glad I purchased while on sale and hope to have updates soon but seeing some courses are from 2017 I highly doubt it. I think it is a waste of time to watch outdated social media strategies as we know it changes at least every 6 months.
