What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?The partitioning feature of Marketing Hub for our team is the most helpful.

"""Hubspot is a great platform - easy to use and tons of functionality"" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?I have been using HubSpot for over three years for both Marketing and Sales Hub. For the marketing hub, my favorite features are landing pages, emails and chatbot. The landing pages are very easy to create (professional looking pages without the hassle of coding) plus you can hardcode items if needed. They load fast and you can do SEO magic on the pages. Email campaigns are also super easy. While they do offer a ton of templates, I always start from scratch. The other part about Hubspot which is very important to me is the high level of support that they offer. The team is very eager and happy to help. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?I wish they didn't have the enterprise versus professional level. As a company that needs to watch spend we are unable to upgrade at this point. However, most everything we need is in the professional.

You don't really get data from native posts (videos & GIFs posted on the platform itself). It's the only thing stopping me from using HubSpot analytics as a singular source of social media metrics. Now that you can save reports, it just seems like a waste of a near-perfect analytics dashboard. When it comes to posting videos and GIFs, I still have to go directly to each social media platform (LinkedIn/Facebook) to post because I can't customize how it's presented (video title and thumbnails) on HubSpot.

Sometimes the formats we assign to a template do not automatically fix themselves (such as text size, etc). It would be great without any issues. Additionally, HubSpot should implement an automated ""warm-up"" tool to assist newsletters and their deliverability to avoid email servers from disregarding any email. Lastly, when looking for an error shown before sending an email, HubSpot does not really pinpoint or highlight where it is. This would be a great tool to add. What would also be useful is a pop-up showing that emails are being scheduled for the next day when the scheduled delivery option is selected (once thought I scheduled an email for the same evening, but it was sent the following evening).

The fact that it also allows for those who like to dive deep and really personalize their experience to do so is fantastic.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.Recommendations to others considering HubSpot Marketing Hub:I would look at Hubspot as my first suggestion to anyone building a marketing team or department.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is HubSpot Marketing Hub solving and how is that benefiting you?I wanted a single platform to manage the majority of my marketing strategy. As a small marketing team I don't have the time to be going back and forth between multiple solutions to build landing pages, design and send emails or track my website performance. Prior to adopting Hubspot we used one system to send emails on occasion and didn't have any landing pages or really measure our digital marketing performance at all. I've been able to manage our marketing entirely within Hubspot and developed a much clearer picture of our past and present metrics.  We have also been able to identify new avenues and high-performing campaigns to focus our attention towards.

Only 2,000 marketing contacts are included in this. Plus If you want to add or buy more marketing contacts, they are sold in increments of 5,000 and cost more than $200 per month.

"""Marketing Hub Enterprise Owner"" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Marketing Hub has been a mixed bag of emotions! I came from 6 years of using Salesforce Marketing Cloud so am used to overly complicated software. Pros of Hubspot: easy drag and drop emails with straightforward list options that allow for complex segmentation building. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Cons: All lists require an OR statement when doing more than one bunch, which means we duplicate many of the same criteria. I also don't love the folders and organization in emails and files - we would prefer to be able to set a favorited view and not be taken to the list each time. Speaking of folders, it would be helpful if the folder you create an email and list in is the folder it lives in without having to move it each time. Lastly, it would be great if the name of the file you are trying to bring into a social post or email would display the name without having to click in. We often use the same image for 1 social post but resized for each platform and there is no quick way to see which file name or size each image is. It would be great if when using the HS-built templates and blocks, they automatically made the side-by-side columns the same length despite the content in there for a cleaner look and feel. This is achievable with a custom template/HTML but we are a slim team so we don't have the bandwidth to build extra pieces at the moment. The survey tool is also a bit half-baked and is missing a lot of options that survey-specific companies have. For example, giving the option to select 'other' and then fill in what their other option would be.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?HubSpot's Marketing Hub is somewhat limited in formatting ability. A couple of examples follow: unless one goes it to the source code to manually do it, one cannot do custom spacing (single space is the lowest one can go). This can make it difficult to make something look nice. The same goes for formatting block quotes. One can indent on the left side, but cannot on the right, unless, again, they do it manually in the source code.

Almost everything we do runs through it and is enhanced as a result. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Hubspot's tools can sometimes be difficult to use because of poor discoverability. For example, when planning a social media post across multiple sites, I had to look click around somewhat blindly to find out how to cancel a repost to LinkedIn or to schedule a post at a certain time. When writing a blog, I had difficulty locating the html code view because the option only appears when your cursor is active in the text editor.

Although it is very easy to create or edit pages, the module capability is very limited. Unline in WordPress, where in we can integrate a required tool or widget, we can't do that in Hubspot.

What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?HubSpot Marketing Hub is truly the best tool on the market for marketing automation. It is very intuitive, well-designed, and easy to learn, all while packing a mean punch of power of capabilities that can grow with your organization. I love the intuitiveness of everything, but especially the workflows (for automation) and the email marketing suite. I've been a power user of HubSpot since 2015 but even when I first started out, I was able to learn 80% of what I needed to know within a few months just by playing around with and using the tool. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?I would not recommend using HubSpot social posting and analytics tools, but rather use something like Sprout Social or Hootsuite. These other tools are worth the extra budget because they are much more robust.  The chatbot is pretty good, but many other bots are better (such as Drift). HubSpot's live chat just isn't as robust or feature-rich.  The reporting capabilities in HubSpot Marketing Hub are strong, but if you use Salesforce as your CRM, you'll probably need to do most reporting there (unfortunately). As a side note, I am not a fan of Salesforce whatsoever and would greatly prefer to use both HubSpot Marketing Hub AND Sales Hub, but that's another time and another review.

"""Great UX and UI design, very intuitive, and easy to learn."" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?I've used a few CRM systems in the past to build out emails including Salesforce Pardot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and Marketo. As an Email Marketer, I can easily customize the modules for every email, create attractive graphics and eye-catching CTAs, and build out an automation system without requiring a third-party vendor (such as Knak and Stensul). This is especially useful as it helps to save costs and stakeholders can approve the emails all in one place. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?When I build out emails, I cannot turn an automated email into a normal one-off email.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Due to Facebook being very specific with how certain ads are created, it doesn't always work to create the ad in HubSpot without going into Facebook after to fix things so Facebook doesn't reject the ad. One example is a recent employment ad I did in HubSpot for Facebook and it got rejected because HubSpot didn't show the option to specify the ad as a ""special category"" which is required by Facebook for all employment ads. There were also issues with the targeting offered through HubSpot that didn't comply with this category of Facebook ad.

"""Excellent Marketing Tool"" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?HubSpot connects your marketing tools with everything else so seamlessly. There is little you cannot do with HubSpot. I love that no matter the problem presented by our team, I can almost always come up with a solution using HubSpot's Marketing Hub tools. It also is easy to learn, easy to use, and saves me a ton of time compared to our old marketing tools. The interface is excellent, and I enjoy working with it. It's also really easy to track your analytics, compare them, and update accordingly. I've preferred it to every other marketing tool I've used so far. It just makes things easy at any level, and it really helps you ramp up your marketing efforts in many ways. Their vast training videos, knowledge base, and blog articles are also really great if you're wanting to learn and grow as a marketer. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?There's not much. The one place I've been a little disappointed in is CTAs. I've had plenty of opportunities where this would have been a handy tool, but the formatting options are not great, and I can never get it to look like natural text, which is what we prefer for our email CTAs. I also wish there was some broader flexibility with workflows to update accounts, but I think those limits affect my company because of the way we set up the HubSpot CRM. I don't image it would be a problem for most companies. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.Recommendations to others considering HubSpot Marketing Hub:It's a great tool! If you are new or still growing in Marketing, Hubspot makes it easy to set up your basics and learn how to improve them as you go.

"""Great platform & data analysis"" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Hubspot is a great platform - we use it mainly for blogs and email marketing. It's super easy to use, and is intuitive as far as organizing and implementing. I love how detailed and specific the data analysis and reports are, too. Not only is there lots of info, but it is clear, easy to find, and can track from start to finish (ex: tracking for a lead or contact who has interacted with our content from start to finish of a campaign) Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?the support team could use some work - there are times they give generic answers of what the issue 'probably is even though we know full well that the suggested fix is already being done/used etc. Similarly, the health checks for SEO tell you problems (i.e. technical issues) but do not have a link to correct these issues at the source. Instead, you have to exit out and do each fix one by one - ex: adding alt text to images that are missing, you can't just click on the image to add text, you have to go to that specific page (after figuring out where it is) or blog and edit each individually. this has been frustrating as someone with SEO experience trying to correct issues left by team members who worked on our sites before me.

I can launch and record the progress of my marketing campaigns in one place - making it easy to analyse data for my boss! We completely manage our social media content, website, blog hosting, and press release hosting via HubSpot. This makes it easier for us to relate engagement with marketing resources to closed-won sales.The support given by the HubSpot team is also very helpful - if we have any technical issues, we can book a ticket with a team using our preferred communication method. The HubSpot staff are always extremely helpful and friendly, and in thee rare occasion that they cannot solve a problem, they can point us in the direction of the developers. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Not all external software can be integrated with Hubspot, but the developers are always working on new integrations and partnerships. The platform is also updated quite frequently, meaning it can be difficult to keep up with the new features and changes. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.Recommendations to others considering HubSpot Marketing Hub:Before committing to Hubspot, ensure that the platform is suited to your business and budget.

We can do practically all our reporting in HS dashboards, without needing external tools. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Some functions are limited, or hidden behind complex programming. Adding custom fonts, for instance, is a drag that I don't believe should be necessary. Also, reporting doesn't always add up (for instance, when we report new leads on a weekly basis, and in another dashboard display lead sources, the number will never add up to the same amount of weekly leads, even with the exact same date settings). We've ran into these problems with reporting, and -easy- customizability numerous times while using Hubspot. Nothing game-breaking, but can be very annoying at times. Support also seems to sometimes just be guessing for solutions or explanations to problems, which are obviously not what's the issue, which can be bothersome. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is HubSpot Marketing Hub solving and how is that benefiting you?Our entire website is built within Hubspot.

"""Powerful and flexible tool with a clear interface"" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?What I like about HubSpot is: 1.

Rich user profiles with all their interactions. 4. The feature of receiving a test email as it's seen by a certain user. 5. Clear interface and a lot of handy help articles. 6. Insanely quick support without bots. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?1. Some issues with non-hubspot forms: HubSpot doesn't always track their submission. 2. Forms don't get time stamps automatically when submitted. So I can't create a list of contacts like ""all users who submitted form X before day Y"". 3. You need two workflows if you open registration for an event. One workflow lets you send a link to a registered user immediately after the registration, and another one sends a reminder on a day of an event. It's impossible to set up a workflow based on action + based on a date. 4. It's impossible to send a test email as is. They send it by HubSpot and add ""Marketing Email Preview"" into the subject. So I can't see if a photo of a sender looks correctly, and check what a subject + a preview text looks like.

I've used Salesforce and Marketo, you just can't beat Hubspot's Marketing Hub.

You have to know what you want from Marketing Hub to get the best out of Marketing Hub. The updates can make the user interface a little confusing at first, especially when you use it as much as I do, but it's nothing that makes me want to jump ship. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.Recommendations to others considering HubSpot Marketing Hub:Make sure you know what you need from Marketing Hub. Like any good software, it's a tool. If you're not using it to solve specific problems you're not going to get much out of it. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is HubSpot Marketing Hub solving and how is that benefiting you?We needed a place to house our CMS in a way that didn't overlap with the sales team's CRM. However, we needed the CRM to pull into Hubspot to find out how each system was talking to each other. Hubspot plays well with so many integrations that I now use Hubspot for Unbounce, all lead capture, and all one to few and one to many email communications.

The reporting dashboards are really a good way to summarize and share info within my team and company. While the blog platform has some issues, overall it's really easy to use and make sure your content is optimized. I also love the email builder--really easy for a non-email designer to be able to create good-looking emails Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?I find the reporting really challenging in some ways. The Traffic Analytics is really limiting compared to someone coming off using Google Analytics; there aren't a lot of ways to slice and dice the data. I also wish you could manage likes and comments for LinkedIn in the social tool. I still don't understand the difference between Analytics Tools and Reports, and it always takes me a few laps through those to find what I need.  The blog and email tools can be finicky; you have to have some basic understanding of HTML to be able to fix some of the formatting and styling things that come up.

"""It works (mostly!)"" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?HubSpot marketing has a lot of strengths. It seems like they put a lot of thought into the UX of the different tools (I use social, landing pages, and email most). For social, the organic scheduling tool is pretty robust -- it nails the basics (scheduling by channel) and a lot of the nice-to-haves (alt text for images). Would like to have thumbnails and captioning capabilities but I can make do. Also very easy attribution for campaigns.  Email tool is similar -- it's a WYSIWYG, drag-and-drop editor. Easy to clone of a design you've already built, and there are smart rules so you don't have to build ten versions of the same newsletter. And if you want to get into the code, you can. The preview tool also works well.  Landing page builder also works well -- same features and functions. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?The integration with Facebook ads is a mixed bag.

If anything I might suggest offering a timed certification course rather than do-on-your-own-time because I find it's easy for myself to put it on the backburner.

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Because the system is always evolving in an effort to improve, there can be some setbacks for veterans and power users as functional elements move to new places in the navigation or functionality is changed.

I love that Hubspot allows you to easily keep track of all your different marketing strategies in one place. It's especially great for keeping track of growth, so that you can see how many people are visiting your site and where they're coming from.  Hubspot also makes it really easy to use content marketing to build organic traffic—you can schedule social media posts, write blog posts, and publish them all inside Hubspot. This is great because it ensures that you're always putting out relevant content that your audience will want to read. You can also share that content on other platforms, like Twitter or LinkedIn, which means more people will see it!  Another thing I love about Hubspot is how well the customer service team works with our team here at Vineforce! They are always available when we need them, whether it's over email or phone call—I never feel like our account isn't being heard by them. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?The pricing is quite expensive, and although they offer a free trial, I think it should be longer than 14 days. Without being able to use the product in its full capacity, it's hard to get a clear idea of how much you'll get out of it.  I also dislike that I can't create a marketing email and save it as a template to reuse without having to clone that email. When I send marketing material to different people at different times, this extra step slows down my process and makes things unnecessarily complicated. Sometimes I can't add people to workflows either, which makes the email portion of HubSpot even more difficult. And what if a client has accidentally removed themselves from emails?

Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is HubSpot Marketing Hub solving and how is that benefiting you?I am learning to personalise and segment my email marketing and learning to leverage workflows and integrations with other software to create a more automated marketing process. The way our HubSpot is set up gives us a really good amount of Contact data so that our sales people can dig into their previous actions and use this information to start engaging conversations with leads.

"""Ticks all my marketing needs"" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?The best part about HubSpot's Marketing Hub has to be how user-friendly it is - the layout, tabs, colours, and graphics make it super simple to grasp without any lengthy walk-through training. I love how easy it is to create and send emails, view all my ad activity in one place and create custom landing pages for my marketing campaigns. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Our team are only using the Starter Hub, so there are, of course, features I would love to access that are locked behind a paywall. I'd like to be able to add anchor buttons to a landing page and do more with sequencing and workflows but that is just a restriction of Starter - once we upgrade, I'm sure I'll have no complaints :) Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is HubSpot Marketing Hub solving and how is that benefiting you?We're able to use one system for the majority of our marketing needs, making it easy for me to share updates with the wider team. In our previous system, we had to do a lot of manual marketing and we're realising that HubSpot is, by far, the more superior product.

"""Amazing product, and easy to use for all stakeholders"" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Ease of use, the ability to grow with the product as our team's size, goals and capability grow. The businesses uses almost all of the main features in our Enterprise account – Ads, marketing automation, email marketing, social scheduling, campaign asset management, reporting and custom dashboards, workflows and sales sequences, chatflows, landing pages/blog, seo tools, etc. We have multiple brands operating within the one account, and while this can cause some challenges, we've been able to navigate these with the advanced strategies shared by account managers and the amazing support team. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?The custom reporting is still a challenge for us, but mainly because it's new to use. We'd love to see the instagram feed contextually/visually display  through the scheduling tool. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is HubSpot Marketing Hub solving and how is that benefiting you?Multiple sales teams and multiple brands operating within one account.  Currently developing a custom quoting tool to work with Hubspot. Managing various types of contact types, including technology product end users who utilise the Service Hub for customer support.

"""Great Marketing platform"" What do you like best about HubSpot Marketing Hub?Compared to some of the other marketing automation platforms I have used before, HubSpot is one of the easiest and most intuitive tools I have ever used. The user interface and experience are outstanding and easy to use. As a marketing automation platform, it offers a comprehensive list of features needed for demand generation, digital marketing, and reporting. Building custom landing pages and forms is very easy (simply drag and drop, plus there are several customizable templates available) and creating automated workflows is a breeze. Their support team is also great and was extremely helpful in resolving some issues we were faced with. They also have a great repository of self-service tutorials and how-to docs that are extremely helpful and useful. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about HubSpot Marketing Hub?The lead scoring implementation can definitely be improved or additional features added to it. When setting up our own lead scoring methodology, some of the advanced criteria and filtering we were looking for were not available with HubSpot, especially around adding Boolean logic for some of the filterings. That capability does not seem to be available yet. We also ran into a few issues after we setup our scoring methodology, where some of the criteria were not applied to the lead and the action they would take. Seems like the scoring criteria do not always work properly or as intended and there are a few errors we captured when doing some spot checking of the leads. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.Recommendations to others considering HubSpot Marketing Hub:HubSpot is a great option for those newer to a marketing automation tool or looking for an easy-to-use interface with a comprehensive list of functions and features. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is HubSpot Marketing Hub solving and how is that benefiting you?We were looking for a comprehensive tool that would also integrate with other platforms we currently use (e.g: Salesforce.com, Google Adwords, social platforms, etc.) and the integration between those other tools has been pretty seamless. This has eliminated the need to do some manual reporting and makes our visibility across our sales and marketing pipeline very seamless, where we can easily track the entire lead journey from beginning to end all from the same platform. In additional saving us time and resources, we have been able to cut cost by removing some of the additional tools we no longer needed and in general.
