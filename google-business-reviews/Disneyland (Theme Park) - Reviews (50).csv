Absolutely magical experience for our first time  at Disneyland. We loved every second of it and can‚Äôt wait for our next trip.  We loved meeting all our favorite characters and the Star Wars ride was exhilarating  and so fun!  Seeing the castle for the first time was truly magical and was just brilliant. I really can‚Äôt wait for my next time!
"This was a very magical experience. Everything was at a high standard including service and interior. We stayed in a deluxe room which also included the d lounge for breakfast and afternoon tea. I wasn't sure what to expect for afternoon tea, however, it included miniature savories as well as dessert and treats including your drinks. So instead of lunch we would often come back to the hotel and have afternoon tea. The staff couldn't do enough for you. I wish we could have stayed longer, however, we are planning on returning again this year. We drove here so parking was nice and easy and very safe."
"I went with my husband and we had a lovely experience, in the night its very beautiful and different. Would love repeating itüòçüòçüòçüòç"
"I am going to write this review before visiting and will write another after we have been.  This review is based on the website and information gathering.  I think the website is shockingly bad.  To be able to gather simple information like location of rides, where to meet Mickey and simple information.  Terrible.  I have called 3 times to book into the Disneyland Hotel and each time the call did not deliver what I wanted.  First time the call handler was very off hand and did not explain all aspects, the second call I booked but did not get an email confirming the booking, the third call, I tried to book the Royal Banquet and it was not booked.  Really poor experience before arriving.  I so hope it improves when we get there."
"Excellent , again to come  with my family & friends , try to complete as much as rides which missed during the visit ."
"The kids loved it and enjoyed every ride they slept like babies on the way home, also found it easy to access by train. Will defo come back"
"I haven‚Äôt even been to Disneyland Paris yet however I want to comment on how poor Disney‚Äôs customer service is. I have booked a trip to the Davy Crockett ranch for may. After booking this I decided to add on character dining for breakfast. When I was making this booking the website had a glitch at the payment stage. I checked my emails to check if the payment went through and there was no confirmation email. So I tried to book it again and it was successful with confirmation straight away.Then I discovered Disney has charged me twice for the booking. However on the emails and account only shows 1 booking. I have been disputed this ever this. Almost 3 weeks and no resolution. I am ¬£206.26 out of pocket which might not seem much for a billion pound company but for me it is. Every time I call or email they just fob me off saying it‚Äôs with the accounts department. I am shocked by the lack of efficiency or urgency from Disney. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm getting my money back and making me second guess the holiday. Did not expect this, I thought it would be a first class service. If this happens to anyone else good luck."
"I love Disney and brought my kids up with beauty and the beast, Bambi and Mickey Mouse. Sadly I think I went there 20years too late and I didn‚Äôt get the whole magic thing. What‚Äôs the magic in queuing for hours for a 2 minute ride, standing in the cold for 30 minutes to meet a character and spending around 12/13 hours out each day with no real provision to relax. We spent a small fortune on food and hot drinks. The whole park runs like clockwork but it‚Äôs just so busy. Apparently according to the data we chose the quietest week to go ?? Really, it was packed everywhere so I dread what it‚Äôs like in peak season. I‚Äôll keep watching the films but sadly I won‚Äôt be returning to the park"
"I spent three unforgettable days at Disneyland Paris with my son, and it was truly magical! We met every character, took tons of pictures, and collected signatures‚Äîit was a dream come true for him.One of the highlights was having breakfast with the characters, which was so much fun, and the buffet was really good. Lunch at the Royal Banquet was also a great experience, with delicious food in a beautiful setting.The park itself is massive, and even after three days, there were still rides and attractions we didn‚Äôt have time for. Every moment was exciting, and the attention to detail in every corner of the park was incredible.The only downside was the long lines and waiting times, but overall, it was an amazing experience that we‚Äôll never forget. Highly recommend for families!"
Very long queues for rides.   Pizza and the pasta bolognese at the Stark cafe was awful.   Staff were friendly and helpful.   I would not recommend it as an attraction unless it is for very young children who seemed to enjoy the parade at 5:30PM.
Terrible customer service - payment taken 3 times by Disney which left us penniless with our two young children and still  not refunded  12 days later! Family of four split up for Princess breakfast which paid extra for! We had to return home as no money - at resort we were  told there was nothing they could do we had to email but we were unlikely to get a  response for at least 48 hrs. We received an automated email and are still waiting for our overpayment to be refunded 12 days later! Shane on you Disney!
"*Fantastic, extraordinary ‚Ä¶.Don‚Äôt miss it if u come to Paris. You can get there by train easily by about 4‚Ç¨I think it‚Äôs better to set a complete day for your visit and suggest you stay there till the night to see the Beauty of lightening too.It has 4 part: Frontier-land, Adventure-land,fantasy-land and discovery-land. I like fantasy and adventure more than the others.These places were more interesting to me:*Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril*Sleeping Beauty Castle*Pirates of the Caribbean*Pinaccio*Peter Pan's FlightYou can eat there by normal and average price.*Considering there is no place to charge your mobile except a place called ‚ÄúArcade alpha‚Äù (you can find it in the map) so go there with full charge mobile and your charger.*You should buy a ticket by 54‚Ç¨ and there is no need to pay more anywhere in any station. It‚Äôs priced is really fair.*The staffs are so friendly and supportive ‚ù§Ô∏è*Dress comfort and easy specially your shoes because you will have a long walking.*If you have kids take stroller and don‚Äôt take them to strange and dark places, some of the attractions may be offensive or scary for them.*The lines are too busy but you can pay more at the city hall and skip the lines üòêit‚Äôs too bad because they show the children: you can pass others by money üòí I think it‚Äôs not a good idea for making money, they can change the entrance price to the upper price to earn more, but act to all in a same way. It‚Äôs a bad role model for children so I decided to give 3 star to wonderful Disney land.* people have to stay in a long line for a 2 minute show or train, it‚Äôs no frustrating specially for the kids.* no need to get your."
"Disney land is an emotional roller coasterThere are times when you are in there where you think it's wonderful and then times when it is a bit of a nightmare My experience was that Disney land brings out the worst in people, most people are ordinary folks who have worked so hard   to get their families in here and they are desperately trying to get their money's worth, there is an under tone of desperation from people, running around trying to avoid long queues, trying to keep kids warm in freezing temperatures, screaming toddlers straped into prams ,  people worn out from queuing for 80 minutes for a 2 minute ride , it's quite soul destroying at times .  The merchandise in the shops is beyond over priced , don't feel the pressure to buy anything they are ripping you off so badly its kind of upsetting as it's heart breaking for us minions who are trying to experience the "" Disney magic "" My tip is download app before you go and familiarise yourself with it , you can check queue times on app , pick 3 rides a day you really want to go on and pay for fast track , it cuts about 20 minutes of your wait Bring in a phone bank for mobile as the app saps life out of phone Prepare yourself for long long long queues , so long I honestly can't see the point in going, it was so disappointing , try and bring in your own water and food as Disney food is not good, unless you book restaurants which I believe are nice but I shudder to think what they cost Be prepared for people vaping all the time , lovely big blow backs of some vile strawberry flavour 2nd hand smoke in your face constantly, Disney seriously wake up and ban vaping it's disgusting Also so many people taking photos obviously for their socials so they can show the world their "" Disney dream "" one lady actually asked me and my son to move so she could take multiple shots of herself with Disney in background, we were just taking a small break and taking in the surroundings , it was very annoying The whole thing has become about people  getting photos for social media pretending to the word that they are living the dream Unless you earn massive money avoid this place , it bleeds you dry"
I had planned our visit extensively for our visit on 23 December and thought I was ready.  We had purchased return transfers from Gare du Nord but on the day at the designated pick up spot  we were met by a Disney rep and had to walk 500 metres to another location to meet the bus.  Sense of arrival was great and we loved  the Christmas tree and decorations.  Wait times were crazy even early in the day. One of the highlights was the queen of hearts maze.  We spent 90 minutes queuing for its a small world and then discovered you could buy individual fast passes for as cheap as 9 euros per person.  We did this for most major rides to save hours in the queues.  This could have been better promoted.  Crowds were next level.  We loved being able to buy champagne in Disney glasses at top of Main Street but surprised they only took cash.  Overall the kids enjoyed their visit.  Pirates of the Caribbean was popular. Poor signage getting back to our bus meant we missed it and had to get a BOLT
I just don‚Äôt know why - but for me there is no doubt that this has to be the 2 worst Disney parks there are. The park is one of the most beautiful ones - Details in every corner - lovely theming and classic attractions. BUT - the Disneyland park has not seen anything new within the last 30 years. Not a single attraction is state of the art.The wait times are beginning to get outrageous .. even during off season. Why ? Poor operations and questionable ride opening hours. As hotel guest you get early entry- unfortunately not a lot of attractions are available at that time - meaning that you wait just as much as you do if you don‚Äôt show up early. The same for closing - why do most attractions close at 17 ? Why - just to boost wait times for no reason. Once the parade is over with small kids - you just have to sit there and wait for the firework to finally happen. And what is the deal with pins and the guest service building ? Why take out the few things that are free and fun - but don‚Äôt cost anything‚Ä¶ not really magical. Why make a big fuzz about not being able to enter that building - same here artificial created wait times- inside the building are more staff members than 3 attractions combined ‚Ä¶ not sure what they are actually doing there.
"Bought a 2-park 3-day pass for Paris Disney and it was the first thing we did on a 6 week family adventure so expectations were high. Mid December and the park was decorated beautifully for Christmas, with lights, trees and fake snow down Main Street throughout the day. A few rides at both parks were under redevelopment which was a bit disappointing but we still had plenty to do. We're not big on thrill rides but did do Crush's coaster and Thunder Mountain which were lots of fun for these 2 teens and 50-somethings. The classics such as It's a Small World and Pirates of the Caribbean were great and the Ratatouille ride was fantastic (although not good for vertigo!). Food was average and overpriced, ride queues averaged 30 minutes (we did wait 50 for Crush's coaster), we could have paid for a fast pass but hubby was not keen given how much we'd already spent on entry tickets. The stage shows were next level and production values are high throughout the parks. My nearly 18 year old got to live her disney princess fantasies and the 14 year old boy was impressed with it all. The evening drone show is particularly good.Thankfully we bumped into a fellow Aussie who gave us some helpful advice about meals. So after wandering around aimlessly on day 1 we used the Disney app to its full advantage for days 2 and 3. On day 2 we booked lunch at the PYM kitchen all you can eat buffet. Even if booked out it's worth refreshing and keep trying because people do cancel. The food here was actually very good. On day 3 we prepaid for burgers at cafe Hyperion and skipped the main queue to go to click and collect, Well worth doing.Beware - there is a disney tax in everything and you WILL spend lots of money on merch! LOLOnce in a lifetime Disney trip! Despite the cost, will do it again."
"I am a young woman who was physically assaulted by a man my father‚Äôs age in Disneyland Paris in August 2024.I have been going to Disneyland Paris for years and many times but that was the last time I would step foot in there after how badly they dealt with this.I have emailed and showed pictures from the assault and it is all documented in guest relations and with the security there and the email I received back from them they may as well of said ‚Äúwho cares, not our problem‚Äù.The incident took place in August 2024 in the line for Mickey and the magician. I was with my two sisters and we were all lining up. A man grabs me by my arm in the line and tugs me backward to get in front of me. This left a huge bruise on my arm with indents of his fingers from the force. I began shouting please don‚Äôt touch me and he laughed and said I didn‚Äôt. His wife then got in my face and threatened me, and his son was yelling that his father didn‚Äôt. I was roaring crying and when we went inside I went and said it to the cast member. While I was telling the cast member the son came over and interrupted and said his father didn‚Äôt touch me. I asked the cast member for the security footage so I could show them exactly what I was talking about and I was disgusted that there is no video footage in the lines (which is absolutely shocking!).I told the cast member it was assault and I was visibly upset. She told me she would get someone after the show to come over and talk to us. Looking back now what horrific way of dealing with this. They let a man who assaulted a girl sit down and enjoy the show while I can‚Äôt breathe or enjoy the show as I had a panic attack.After the show we waited (myself and my sisters) and went to the girl and were told the family left (of course they did they ran as soon as possible) and the security were outside looking for him. Security were nice and took it seriously however why would this be allowed ? We allow people who assault others to sit and enjoy the show? So Disney only care about its money and not the safety. I went further and made the report to guest relations where o was given a fast pass for the show.Like seriously? A fast pass for a show I have trauma for now and could never line up on that. I suffer with anxiety and the distress this entire situation was for me to this day is upsetting. I didn‚Äôt go back to the park the next day out of fear. I have been having therapy for 5 months now on how to deal with queues and lines and get over the assault. I will try attach the picture and show you how bad my arm was left and how Disney allowed a violent man to watch a show and roam around the park not caring the distress caused to others.Disney you should be ashamed. I have told everyone high and low and warned people not to go. Before I told people I allowed a saving grace of their email to redeem how wrong they were. The reply as mentioned earlier basically said not their problem and I can try attach the picture of this too. Ruby from guest relations who responded did not care in the slightest. You wouldn‚Äôt get this treatment in Disney world where they bend over backwards to protect and help guests. Disgusted.Watch out for your safety if you go. They didn‚Äôt for me."
"Unfortunately due to the red warning storm we had in Scotland last Friday, our trip was cancelled by the airline. @disneylandparis refused on the Friday to move the date, or refund for the 2 day tickets for the Saturday.Incredibly poor for a childrens theme park, never mind with one with such a wonderful reputation. We rebooked the trip at great expense to visit again this weekend, but it seems we have to purchase 2 days tickets once again. I provided proof of our trip cancellation, but they were unwilling to assist. Incredibly surprised and disappointed by this decision, as is my 4 year old."
January trip but found parks to be absolutely heaving with ridiculous queues and hated every minute never again I‚Äôm sorry ‚Ä¶ paid for half board and food was awful it used to be superb. Shame on you Disney. As for our room ‚Ä¶ turned on TV and no Disney channel ??? Are you kidding ! We needed a chill and nothing in English other than CNN ? Will never return
"This was our very first time visiting Paris and Disneyland Paris. We just couldn't get enough of the whole experience. It was the highlight of our whole trip. All of us adults and kids are still dreaming of the whole experience. The staff was amazing and super helpful. Walt Disney Studios Avengers Campus with the theme song playing gave us goosebumps every single time as we are hardcore Marvel fans. The character performances were fabulous. If only we could get a prior notification when each character comes out on the street or the roof would have been fantastic. I couldn't beleive my eyes when I saw my favourite character Loki. I missed the show as I didn't know when it was happening. It was a minor hiccup compared to the whole next level experience with superb rides, the Disney stars on parade. The younger kids loved meeting Mickey and Princesses. The Avengers Flight force ride was out of this world. Since we had only 1 day to cover most activities we missed out on most. It was surprising it was still really crowded during winter but queues moved fairly quick. Unexpected meet with Captain Jack Sparrow was epic. He was so kind to stop and take a pic with me. Web Slinger, Ratatouille, Phantom Manor, Small World are few main rides we did. The other family went in all the kids rides on Disneyland Park. The lights how at 8pm was so magical and standing outside in the freezing cold was totally worth it. The restaurants werenot too crowded but we grabbed bites from trucks as we wanted to do more activities. Wish we had more time to do more rides as 1 day is definitely not enough for the 2 parks. Will need atleast 3 days. Next time we will definitely choose   to stay at a Disney Hotel so we can enjoy extra magic time before the general crowd. Using the Disneyland Paris app was also super easy. Will definitely give this wholesome family fun experience a 10 out of 10."
"Spent 2 days at dlp last week, alot of people saying that disney has lost its magic,I agree with this to a degree and it must up its game in regards to make sure guests have a magical time,hardly saw any members of staff roaming the park apart from the cleaners,also a big reason why the magic is lacking is the state of society in general, angry rude ignorant people, who have no regard for other visitors openly smoking and vaping anywhere they please, pushing anyone in there way,still we made the best of it and enjoyed disneyland Park only waiting between 5 and 20 mins for the rides we wanted, we visited 2 years ago and thought the parades and nighttime show was far better than this time,as for the studios we thought this was terrible far to much work going on and very over crowded with nowhere to walk or sit down so left after 30 minutes and returned to the other park,disney village was also undergoing a big refurbishment ,will probably wait a few years before returning when hopefully the refurbishment will be completed.."
From the first gate it reminds you of happiness and joy that all of us have been experiencing since we were little. Disney gives you your childhood memories and takes you back there.
Worst place their behaviour quality is not good staff was not good I would never recommend you all to visit over here because when the entry become full they only allow Europe passport holders not give the priority of tourist worst place worst everything
"Always have a magical time at Disneyland Paris, where the staff, the shows, the night illuminations really help with the magic. The new show really was good with the projections in the main street, which we already had experience in Disneyland California but this was so nostalgic and right into the heart, so a top feeling just before you leave the main park. Staff was great, food was good and snacks as well. Stayed at Sequoia for the 1st night, got a really nice room and had a really good experience at check in with Nuno Lui, who made sure to let us know the luggage could be transferred to Disneyland Hotel in the morning, which meant we got straight into the parks in the following day. I didn't know this so the fact that he paid attention to what I told him was gonna be our plan and tailored for us, was TOP. We had our bags in our room around 6pm, which was before dinner, so were able to get ready for our Manhattan experience with 0 fuss. Once in Manhattan, we had a great experience, where Nicolas took very good care of us, food was great and he made sure the dishes my wife picked didn't contain tomato, as she is allergic. We had a great experience at the Royal Banquet, or so we thought, but sadly, my wife got sick in the middle of the night. I know this is a buffet but I still feel once I told the staff she was allergic to tomato we should have been taken around the buffet to understand what she could eat, as she did her best to pick the dishes she thought didn't contain but this is a bit of a mission impossible, resulting in a really bad night before our last park day.We had a good experience at the Stark Industries and at the food carts we got around both parks for some nice snacking / small bites and also, at the Disney Village at the Steakhouse and Annette's.There are a few things to mention here that for me are the reason why this trip will never be a 5 start for me and my wife. I paid 85eur for a photopass for my 3 days and came home feeling like I paid 8.5eur per photo. There was 1 single magic spot in all our stay, never see photopass photographers anywhere, a lot of characters don't have this as well, so why are we being charged so much for it? The difference between Paris and the american parks is huge, I always come home with so many memories from the american parks photo wise and sadly with barely any from Paris. The price of premier access is insane, will have again to mention the genie in Disneyland California, which even includes photos!!!! and is so much cheaper than Paris. I'd definitely prefer to queue 5/10 minutes and have more people access it than feeling that you need to be rich to have access to these experiences. Also, there's still a lot of main rides not included with it, I think after paying so much this should really feel premier. Also, aware of the state of Walt Disney Studios right now with the re-theming and understanding with that but it does mean place gets too crowded in the few tunnels where we can pass to go from one side to the other of the park, and really not feeling a lot magical right now. We still enjoyed the attractions there and the pixar show is always a good experience. A bit disappointed with the night show, feeling like it's lacking and was a waste of our time."
"Ok, Where to start‚Ä¶ so me and my husband booked a last minute trip to Disneyland Paris. The whole experience from start to finish have been awful. The buses running to and from the hotels to Disneyland are not regular you will be waiting atleast 45 minutes for the bus, by then lots of people are waiting already and you are crammed onto the bus like sardines.  If you have anxiety or are claustrophobic AVOID getting the bus. And when going from Disney to the hotel you have people shouting TAXI TAXI TO HOTEL GOOD PRICE every 5 seconds which was incredibly draining and not what you need after a long day out. Going into Disneyland everything is extremely lackluster.  There‚Äôs a lot of walking but not really much entertainment or things to see on the way. No where to sit down and relax.  Hardly any cast members around.  A lot of park works going on at the moment with boards up and stuff blocked off.  A lot of the rides were shut for refurbishment.  Me and my husband booked a table to plaza gardens and was left to wait outside in the rain before 30 minutes had passed so we just left.  The food prices are ridiculous.  In the whole of Disney. Nothing is run correctly and honestly Disney should be ashamed of themselves.  French people in general are incredibly rude.  They push past you ,barge into you and they do not apologise.  Honestly this has been the worst holiday I have ever been on and I have been a lot of places.   I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anybody to visit Disneyland Paris.  Go to Disney world Florida instead don‚Äôt waste your money here because you will regret it.  SPEND IT ELSEWHERE! If I could give this place 0 stars I would We also stayed at the grand magic hotel which was not a good experience but that‚Äôs for another review."
I booked a one day park ticket for my little sister‚Äôs 21st Birthday and we were in re so excited to go. Unfortunately 3.5 days before we were supposed to go we were informed by our airline that there was a Status Red warning all flights would be either cancelled or delayed. We rescheduled our flights to 2 days later so we could still celebrate. I informed Disney immediately but because I was 6 hours outside the cancellation period there was nothing that could be done. For a company that is centred around family and celebration of we were shocked that they refused to even change the date by 2 days.I cannot believe that such a huge organisation whose focus is family fun would not even try to be accommodating in such unforeseen circumstances and has really left a negative impression with me and ruined a special birthday.
"Spent Monday-Friday last week here, unfortunately lots of things were closed without any previous notice. With it being -5 at times, there was no shelters, no cafes & there wasn‚Äôt really a Disney feel going on. Rides were constantly down in hour before it opened to the public so it was no use being early.The rides themselves were amazing but everything else wasn‚Äôt great."
"Been here six times as a family of 4 and can say the magic for us isnt there anymore. Disney really needs to sort out the que system!  So many people push in to catch up with their family instead of que together. Happened so many times the three days just barging past like you don't exsist, no excuse me or thank you. The last family had done this to us, 4 of them was in front of us then next minute at separate moments 7 of them barged past us, no manners, no excuse me just pushing past physically touching. We are not a argumentative couple but did end up having a confrontation with this spanish family and apparently we are 'british people' ...  For a family that have to que in all ques all day and not in special assistance it can be a long day especially in the cold with two small children and the constant rudeness and que pushing from certain people is ridiculous!!  So many selfish people around but they dont care as there is no enforcement.  Disney has also swapped the dream factory to a Minnies Musical moment, what a rubbish swap! Such a poor show especially if you have seen the dream factory!! It is a standing show and i wouldnt rush to que as we was near the front but once you go first room you are pushed back with everyone rushing in a small door pushing you. Buzz ride is still backing up and you feel like you stop so much.Spiderman broke the first time but fortunately the staff kindly let us go again.Characters are a bit limited. We went to see Minnie mouse and luckily got there when we did as they shut the que off. It was a long wait as special assistance line was also full.We have been to both disneyland paris and disneyworld Orlando many times and would recommend you save your money and visit Orlando! Stayed in hotel Cheyenne which was disappointing and room wasn't clean, only good thing is its a walk away and magic hour."
"Fourth time here, and probably the last time. It was a terrible experience. Lack of animation in the streets, very poor. Waiting times specially for young kids it should be some kind of animation to help children enduring the waiting times. Restaurants that we tried overpriced and very poor food quality . Only show that we really enjoyed was the Parade as we went home shortly afterwards . Poor ‚Ä¶ very poor experience ."
"DLP is a waste of time, half of the rides & restaurants are closed, which means that you have no shelter from the freezing -2 weather at the moment. It‚Äôs full prices for half services, which is absolutely disgraceful. Disney should be ashamed of themselves although they don‚Äôt care one bit. Even the Disney shops look second rate, more like a character shop at the premium outlet in Florida than a proper Disney store."
Brilliant place not really into Disney but this place has so much to see and do must admit I did enjoy the studios more than the park myself but kids enjoyed it all and that‚Äôs the main thing.
"We went to Disneyland Paris on 18th January. We started in Disney studios and were let down that a lot of rides and attractions were closed for modernisation and renovation. Most of the Avengers campus was closed and Spiderman web ride was down due to technical issues. Also, the Disney characters were actively ignoring certain children, and not one cast member attempted to stop any queue jumping, in fact they condoned it by then pulling the children first who queue jumped! We moved over to Magic Kingdom which was a lot better managed, more fun, and generally better maintained. Other than the cold temperature i cannot fault Magic KingdomWe opted for Steak dinner in the Silver Spoon steakhouse which was delicious and we got a birthday cake for my son, the servers made sure to sing happy birthday too"
"So our daughter wanted us to come to DLP with her and our young grandson, as we‚Äôve done Disney World around 30+ times we said ok. What an absolute waste of money, Disney Studios only us 50 percent open you can walk round it in 15 minutes, queued to get a photo with both Antman and Goofy but obviously queuing is not something the French understand as if kids where in a Disney costume the characters brought them to the front and other little ones were pushed to the back, blatantly rude why would people pay for this I do not know. Went over then to the Magic Kingdom, which was better but again so many things closed and so many restaurants not open. We also went to the Silver Spur steakhouse cost ‚Ç¨180, for a second rate meal although we did pay ‚Ç¨25 for a birthday which was very nice.Truthfully this trip has cost me ¬£2k, when honestly it‚Äôs not been worth ¬£1k. Disney I think need to realise that when your only offering 1/2 the service why should the guests pay full price. In all in this is a waste of money and never again after this would I visit a Disney theme park."
"Went at Halloween 24, never seen it as busy, queued for absolutely everything, 1 hour 30 for 1 crappy ride in particular, ruined the experience for the entire family, wud never go back. Disney let about 10000 people 2 many into the parks, absolute joke, pure greed"
"We visited Disneyland Paris for the 13th time for 2 days (arrived on December 9th and left early on December 11). We were also visiting with two priority cards on green.The Disneyland park never disappoints. In just over half a day we were able to do all the rides (except Pinocchio and Casey Junior as they were closed).The Christmas decorations throughout the park were great, especially down Main Street.Walt Disney Studios is a great park with many good rides. The rides are normally doable in around 3 and a half hours (if not a busy day) and with a priority card 2 and half hours. We love the park but sadly a lot of Walt Disney Studios is boarded up which was a shame but we did find out during the visit it is apparently because of the renaming of the park to Disney Adventure land.The food at both parks can be unpredictable; it can either be the best you've ever had or the worst. Unfortunately, the Disney parks are not very accommodating for people with coeliac disease (gluten free). At many fast-food restaurants in the park (like Bella Notte), our only options were salads/vegan food or microwave meals that resembled and tasted like baby food. At buffets you also only have a small option of foods.Most of the staff members are very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. However, there were a few staff members who weren't very friendly.For instance, while we were getting off Big Thunder Mountain, a family member accidentally dropped their phone onto the tracks. Although we knew it wasn‚Äôt a ideal situation, they could have been more understanding and friendly. They didn't keep us informed about what was happening. When we tried to explain the situation, they just shrugged, as if to say, ""What am I supposed to do?"" We stood there without any information for quite some time and got the impression that they were annoyed with us as they kept shaking their heads at us and rolling their eyes. It would have been helpful if a staff member had quickly/briefly explained what would happen next and didn't do those gestures towards us, especially since the person who dropped the phone was only struggling to get out because she is disabled. Despite the behavior of a few workers, the majority of the staff were very helpful.The priority card generally works well, but halfway through, we realized that the green color assigned to one of our family members was not correct, as she was having difficulty with the steps and getting in and out of the ride vehicles. We were unsure what to do with the card as it wasn't the correct colour. Having the green card meant we used both the premier queue and if there wasn't one we used the disabled queue. Most of the premier queues only skip half of the main queue and then merge into the normal queue. In our opinion, there should be a staff member present at every ride where the premier queue merges with the normal queue, as we faced challenges with this merging process. For example , on the Indiana Jones ride, no one wanted to let us into the queue. When we finally found a space to join, a group behind us started pointing and yelling that we had ""just pushed in,"" which attracted unwanted attention and made us feel uncomfortable. The merging experience often leads to awkwardness since people are reluctant to let you join the line. A staff member's presence would greatly alleviate this situation.Another issue we encountered was at the ride ""Le Pays des Contes de F√®es"" (the storybook boats next to Casey Jr.). The boarding area for disabled guests has a significant gap and step between the platform and the boat, making it very challenging for those with disabilities. Staff members had to physically help everyone out of the boat. In contrast, the area where guests in the normal queue board actually has a smaller gap. It would be ideal to add something like a removable platform to make exiting the boat easier. On our second attempt at riding the ride, we went through the normal queue, which meant there was a smaller step the boat as the gap wasn't as big but the actual queue stairs and the moving boat were then an issue.Queue jumping can be a significant issue in the parks, we noticed it more in the disabled queues. For instance, While we were in the disabled queue, a mother instructed her son to run past us and duck under the barriers to get ahead in line. She then pushed us aside while waving her disabled pass in our faces, insisting that her disability allowed her to go in front of us. We tried to explain that it was a queue for everyone with a disabled pass and that it's not acceptable to push ahead or send children under the barriers then catch up. Two staff members saw this happen but did not do anything, for a brief second it looked like one of the workers was going to say something but he then backed down. The workers continued to watch, and one of them eventually walked away. The worker then allowed that family on the ride before us, despite witnessing them send their under the barrier and push past us. We also had people try push in front of us on several other rides (The Parachutes, Crushes Coaster, The Story boats) . When We were waiting for the Toy Soldiers Parachute ride in the disabled queue a large family of over 25 members in front of us repeatedly rode in groups, and when each ride ended, the group would quickly run off the ride and past everyone in the disabled queue to rejoin their relatives. This meant we were in the queue for 40 minutes and if the queue didn‚Äôt move. Thankfully on the parachutes, Crushes Coaster and the boats the worker made sure whoever was queues up first could go on first. However, sadly some workers like the slinky dog worker choose not to do or say anything at all. The Christmas parade was amazing. It was wonderful to see the festive floats lit up in the dark and the characters in their Christmas outfits. We arrived an hour early to secure front-row views. It's definitely worth the wait.The fireworks were good. It was our first time watching them in over seven years, but we were a bit disappointed to see that not much had changed. However, if you haven't seen the fireworks before, you will likely enjoy them! The Notre-Dame de Paris show was nice to watch, and it was exciting to experience something new. The Notre-Dame show was only on for a few days, so we feel fortunate to have attended. Although the Notre-Dame show replaced the usual drone show, we would still love to see the drone show someday, as we have never had the chance to watch it before.The shops at Disneyland Paris are really pricey, but you kind of expect that at Disneyland. There's not a ton of variety in what they sell, and it feels like most of it is just Stitch-themed stuff, which kind of takes away from the overall selection.I would definitely recommend a visit for all ages. There are things to do for every age group. There are many rides for thrill seekers as well as numerous rides that are slow and gentle. Even if you don't like rides there is lots of things to do like meet & greets, watch shows and parades, walk round the labyrinth, castle and also loads of photo opportunities"
The Park itself was excellent but the problem was we stayed for the display and it was late starting. The crowds were unmanageable. I saw one woman have a panic attack as she tried to leave and get through the crowds. We also tried to leave as were afraid we would miss our train ‚Ä¶there was no way out other than going through the crowds. I emailed Disney and got no reply. Just want people to know if you stay for the fireworks you cannot leave until it ends . If it is delayed you will have to wait as there is no way to get out . I would not stay for the fireworks as it was not worth the distress
"Yes, the lights are pretty and the music is Christmassy, but do you like to see Characters outdoors and actually like to eat? - Then forget it. Saw no characters outdoors all day - you'll only get to see them if you can get indoors and find somewhere to eat, but the places are always packed full, blocked by staff who'll say all day ""Sorry, we're full."" We got to the park really early and spent the day starving and judging by the misery of other people, so did they. Queues for rides are too long and it's December folks. Half of the studios was closed and what remained was underwhelming. Could barely see the castle show, as it was so rammed, so we really wished we hadn't waited until 10pm and left at 3:30pm when we were going to. This isn't the first time we've been to Disneyland Paris, but we wont be going again. A lot of money to walk around a bog standard theme park, cold and hungry."
"Another dream come true!! After 33 years of waiting I finally made it to Disneyland Paris! Like Disneyland USA our 1st ride was Space Mountain (Hyperspace Mountain) was which better than expected.  Some of the other highlights were the Dragon under the Castle, Dinner at Walt‚Äôs, BTMRR, Pirates and of course Illuminations at night. It‚Äôs now my 2nd favorite Disney Park that I have visited.."
"My husband, 5 year old son and I stayed for 2 nights in Disneyland Hotel and I feel disappointed as it was very overpriced for what we got. We had so many issues with our room, the door didn‚Äôt lock and had to be repaired twice, the phone cable was broken so frustrating when I tried calling reception, the jug didn‚Äôt work and every time we had an issue we had to go down to reception with took ages because the lifts are so slow. The manager gave us a late checkout but that was more stressful than it was worth as our keys stopped working after 11am‚Ä¶ so we had to go to reception twice and they still didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ we were lucky to find a cleaner to let us in so we could get our luggage to leave because I didn‚Äôt want to go back down to reception. The whole experience with the hotel was frustrating and very disappointing. The service was definitely not 5 star as we didn‚Äôt have a turn down service on the 2nd night so no fresh cups and restocking of the complimentary mini bar. As for the food, it was good but overpriced for what you get. Lucky we had the half board so not as bad but we‚Äôve had a lot better in France.As for the parks, we were lucky not to have to line up more than half hour for each ride but it‚Äôs an exhausting day trying to fit everything in. The cold weather didn‚Äôt help. There aren‚Äôt any nice cafes to sit and rest which was disappointing. Too many merchandise shops and not enough focus on comfort.Would we come back, no."
"Dont get me wrong, Disney is a magical place for all ages. There is always plenty of magical parades / shows and something always going on.However sadly they are slowly pricing out anyone whos not got lots of moneyThe longer you go the cheaper the admission, but most people only go for 1 or 2 days and admission costs on excess of ¬£100 for an adult per day. When its busy if you want rides and there are big queues you probably wont think that you have your moneys worth.Disney used to do a fast pass system where you got a time for a ride and could join the quick queue once you done that you could get another for another ride, but not before so that everyone got a fair chance, but now this has been scrapped and you can pay a premium price to join the fast lane for all rides, so therefore another perk for those who can afford it and not for the ordinarys.That and the expensive food and drink when you are in. You can fill your own water bottles (if you can find a working station) and bring your own food in but if you are spending all day there it can be heavy carrying lots of food.We used to go most years but it may be quite a long time before we return again"
"Awful experience, near to Surreal. 1.Terrible atmosphere 2.Don‚Äôt waste your money,This is my first time at Disneyland Paris, I have been to Disney World America twice I would rather pay the extra money and go back to the USA,.If you‚Äôre looking for a Disney experience this is far from it, 90% Of the staff are not friendly whatsoever they do not smile or have that known Disney happy attitude, they do not want to make eye contact and are Very unhelpful. Just one example, if they don‚Äôt know the answer to your question, they don‚Äôt even bother to seek help, they just shrugged their shoulders.Restaurants are shocking prices and disgustingly dirty, not just because they have a large volume of people using them, this is more like long-term dirt, the food is very low quality in every restaurant. Surrounding tourists‚Ä¶ It was almost like walking into a film, People were physically pushing (not bumping into you) and shoving walking around the Disney park and restaurants to another level, how there isn‚Äôt a fight I will never know.I‚Äôve Never experienced this to this level whether that be Disney world, Shopping at Christmas at a busy shopping mall, Night out on the town/clubs, this was really surreal, and it‚Äôs not just because of overcrowding, the people were pure rude, for example if you opened a door for shops or restaurants people would just physically push pass your family and walk in or out, with no manners and No thank you! IF YOU WANT TO RUIN YOUR DISNEY EXPERIENCE THIS IS THE PLACE!"
We had high expectations of Disneyland but were left disappointed. Not a single character was seen roaming around. The only time we saw any was during the parade and that was for a total of 2 mins and were not seen again. Majority of the rides were closed as were other shops. This was such a waste of time for us. We only managed to get onto 2 rides and during this other rides were also closing shop hours before the firework display. The firework was the only thing worth seeing. We will not be returning.
"Surprise visit to Disneyland Paris before the ride renovations started on 6/1, there is a lot of building work ongoing that others have mentioned. The Big Thunder Mountain ride was shut for most of the day (now closed for months for annual maintenance) and we had to pay for fast passes to get on it, no problem as best ride in the park.Very busy in the park on 4/1 with Christmas season finishing a day later. However able to do some rides we thought we would not get on, including Pinocchio, Peter Pan and Snow White. Some rides stupid times (Buzz Lightyear 80 minutes) for what they were.Weather was good for most of the day, some rain later which meant the drone show was cancelled but the light show was good, fireworks good as usual. Don‚Äôt bother with the parade, complete waste of time.Other gripe was Minnie was no where to be seen, replaced by Stitch at the usual character meet, sacrilege. Forced into Mickey character meet (2 hours).This place is still magical, however maybe next visit will be in a couple of years at least. Recommended."
"A magical experience with your children, the good thing about being a kid is they don‚Äôt notice things that an adult does in regards to quality, price etc. a lot of walls up for maintenance but again kids not bothered or even noticed. The whole place is so clean and has that magical feeling in the air seeing the kids faces light up at almost every turn makes it amazing so credit must go to the place.With the adult head on I must warn and be frank when I say the place once through the gates is disgustingly overpriced, for example absolutely everything is fast food at Michelin prices! We were ¬£65 for 3 microwave pizzas and a portion of pasta that was rank rotten! That‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg! The full place is just a glutton for money absolutely nowhere nice to just sit and have a drink or if you fancy a bite in a nice atmosphere, ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù are a mess with chairs and tables scattered everywhere but to be fair that‚Äôs not the staffs fault as it‚Äôs the clientele that visit the place that are so ignorant and entitled‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a place that highlights all what‚Äôs wrong with the modern world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶people would rather experience it through filming on their phones, folk constantly in the way and barging past for ‚Äòthe perfect pic‚Äô‚Ä¶..a girl was even texting whilst on a ride getting whizzed round whilst furiously typing‚Ä¶..we went to the show called ‚Äòtogether‚Äô which was amazing really well done and fabulous for the kids and grown ups too I may add‚Ä¶..full grown man row in front sat with EarPods in throughout!! Great place for kids ages 4 and above anything younger would say be a bit pointless.Be prepared to be annoyed unless you have a phone glued to your hand and are immune to being in the moment."
"We travelled here with our daughter, son in law and his parents and our granddaughters.  This was my husband and I‚Äôs 3rd visit to Disneyland Paris and this was for a double birthday celebration.  They have been more times than us. We always stay in the Newport Bay Hotel.  Although the public areas appear updated, the rooms certainly haven‚Äôt been.  The rooms are clean enough, and the beds are very comfortable, but the furniture is in a very poor state. The drawers are very hard to open and get stuck all the time and it all looks well knocked with marks. My family remarked it had not changed in the 10 years they‚Äôve been going there. All the furniture is old and marked, the carpets could do with a wash as ‚Äòcrunchy‚Äô in places.  The casement window fell off when we tried to get some fresh air in. We had to wedge it back.  The drainage in the bath and sink was extremely slow. The hotel staff were,however, lovely and nothing was too much trouble. I would especially like to commend Fiona from the Concierge desk who went above and beyond to secure an electric mobility chair from a trusted outside source for me as I am awaiting a knee replacement and my husband and family were struggling with push type wheelchairs obtained from the Stroller shop which were not designed for this extensive kind of use.  If you need a wheelchair, see the Concierge and they can arrange the delivery of ECV from their trusted local pharmacy at very reasonable rates. The concierge also recharge your appliance for you every night when you come in for the evening with no fee. So, venturing into the two parks we noticed immediately there is extensive building work being undertaken everywhere.  Studio Universal seems to have been brought up to standards we expect with a few fast rides and digital experiences in a much more modern setting although a lot is still under wraps for refurbishment.  Queues for nearly all rides range from 55 minutes to two hours.  The Magic Kingdom, Frontierland and surrounding areas seem to just be the same and our granddaughters (aged 10 & 12) found the rides a bit tame.  More suitable for younger children I think.  Nothing has changed there at all. A lot of the rides kept being closed for technical difficulties. Indiana Jones was the only fast coaster. Thunder Mountain appears to be closed for the foreseeable future.   A lot of the food kiosks and eateries were shut. This was troublesome as the weather was awful most of the time and a nice warm drink was hard to find.  The whole place was fully booked out so it‚Äôs not like it was a quiet season. The shops seemed to have less selection than on our last visit but the prices were very high.  Again, the parks were kept clean and the public toilets always clean. Queueing time much the same in all the parks.  Sadly, because the weather was so wet nearly all the parades were cancelled and that was disappointing. There was a distinct lack of characters in the parks as well. The meet and greets in the designated places were still there but with very long queues, which in the icy rain wasn‚Äôt pleasant and our youngest got too cold standing still waiting so didn‚Äôt get half as many autographs in her book as she had hoped. Would highly recommend you take your own crisps as at ‚Ç¨6 a packet it can be costly for a snack!  We all  agreed that for us, the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô is missing in what is essentially a special place for young and old to escape from everyday life.  This is just another theme park for day trippers of which there were loads! It may be a different story when all the refurbishments have been completed but I feel that will be a few years down the line.  It was full of French and Europeans. Very few visitors from the UK."
"We surprised the children on Christmas Day and Christmas became even more magical for the family with a trip to Disneyland Paris. It has been without doubt our best Christmas ever and we loved all the Christmas decorations, shows, parades and the overall atmosphere. Highly recommend a trip for an extra special Christmas. It‚Äôs cold so wrap up warm and be prepared to queue so have snacks and games ready for the kids!"
Booked for the whole day and both parks. The smaller and more modern park had the newer Disney franchises and we attempted a number of rides. Always said no roller coasters but those we went on were not too scary. Luckily they were inside and in the dark. The second park more traditional and the rides less exciting. Waited through to the two light shows. Best advice. Remember where you parked as the rush at leaving is massive. Worthwhile visit but missed Micky and Minnie
"First time at DLP for Christmas and what an experience ... the shows, the lights, the food were all fantastic (...the weather, not so much ... make sure you pack trousers!)We would absolutely go back for another New Years parade, the children loved it as much as we did, just so much to do!We stayed in the Santa Fe this time, and found the whole place clean and comfortable with great facilities for what you need whilst there (the only downside was no English-speaking TV channels except for the same 4 episodes of Timon and Pumbaa Wild about Safety!).100% recommend everything!"
"My first visit to Disneyland Paris began amazing up until the end of the day when we were told that there would be no drones for the illuminations. We waited until the end of the illuminations in hope that fireworks would occur, but sadly they did not. Due to weather conditions which would have been known much earlier during the day as it was pouring with rain and windy the entire time I was there, it wasn‚Äôt until the very end of the show we were told that due to wind, the fireworks would not occur. Whilst listening to ‚ÄòA dream is a wish your heart makes‚Äô, Disneyland Paris took my dream of wanting to see fireworks and crushed them. I am also very upset that Disneyland would have known fireworks would not be present prior to the show and did not state this until 8pm in which I and other families would have stayed and spent extra money on dinner as they waited for a show that unbeknown would not happen. If known earlier, I would have went home and enjoyed the rest of my day, rather than waste half my day waiting for fireworks. I cannot imagine how younger children felt or those who spent extra money to be placed at the front to view the show."
No words can explain the amazing and magical experience!!You have to see it and enjoy it by yourself!!
