Absolutely magical experience for our first time  at Disneyland. We loved every second of it and can‚Äôt wait for our next trip.  We loved meeting all our favorite characters and the Star Wars ride was exhilarating  and so fun!  Seeing the castle for the first time was truly magical and was just brilliant. I really can‚Äôt wait for my next time!
"This was a very magical experience. Everything was at a high standard including service and interior. We stayed in a deluxe room which also included the d lounge for breakfast and afternoon tea. I wasn't sure what to expect for afternoon tea, however, it included miniature savories as well as dessert and treats including your drinks. So instead of lunch we would often come back to the hotel and have afternoon tea. The staff couldn't do enough for you. I wish we could have stayed longer, however, we are planning on returning again this year. We drove here so parking was nice and easy and very safe."
"I went with my husband and we had a lovely experience, in the night its very beautiful and different. Would love repeating itüòçüòçüòçüòç"
"I am going to write this review before visiting and will write another after we have been.  This review is based on the website and information gathering.  I think the website is shockingly bad.  To be able to gather simple information like location of rides, where to meet Mickey and simple information.  Terrible.  I have called 3 times to book into the Disneyland Hotel and each time the call did not deliver what I wanted.  First time the call handler was very off hand and did not explain all aspects, the second call I booked but did not get an email confirming the booking, the third call, I tried to book the Royal Banquet and it was not booked.  Really poor experience before arriving.  I so hope it improves when we get there."
"Excellent , again to come  with my family & friends , try to complete as much as rides which missed during the visit ."
"The kids loved it and enjoyed every ride they slept like babies on the way home, also found it easy to access by train. Will defo come back"
"I haven‚Äôt even been to Disneyland Paris yet however I want to comment on how poor Disney‚Äôs customer service is. I have booked a trip to the Davy Crockett ranch for may. After booking this I decided to add on character dining for breakfast. When I was making this booking the website had a glitch at the payment stage. I checked my emails to check if the payment went through and there was no confirmation email. So I tried to book it again and it was successful with confirmation straight away.Then I discovered Disney has charged me twice for the booking. However on the emails and account only shows 1 booking. I have been disputed this ever this. Almost 3 weeks and no resolution. I am ¬£206.26 out of pocket which might not seem much for a billion pound company but for me it is. Every time I call or email they just fob me off saying it‚Äôs with the accounts department. I am shocked by the lack of efficiency or urgency from Disney. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm getting my money back and making me second guess the holiday. Did not expect this, I thought it would be a first class service. If this happens to anyone else good luck."
"I love Disney and brought my kids up with beauty and the beast, Bambi and Mickey Mouse. Sadly I think I went there 20years too late and I didn‚Äôt get the whole magic thing. What‚Äôs the magic in queuing for hours for a 2 minute ride, standing in the cold for 30 minutes to meet a character and spending around 12/13 hours out each day with no real provision to relax. We spent a small fortune on food and hot drinks. The whole park runs like clockwork but it‚Äôs just so busy. Apparently according to the data we chose the quietest week to go ?? Really, it was packed everywhere so I dread what it‚Äôs like in peak season. I‚Äôll keep watching the films but sadly I won‚Äôt be returning to the park"
"I spent three unforgettable days at Disneyland Paris with my son, and it was truly magical! We met every character, took tons of pictures, and collected signatures‚Äîit was a dream come true for him.One of the highlights was having breakfast with the characters, which was so much fun, and the buffet was really good. Lunch at the Royal Banquet was also a great experience, with delicious food in a beautiful setting.The park itself is massive, and even after three days, there were still rides and attractions we didn‚Äôt have time for. Every moment was exciting, and the attention to detail in every corner of the park was incredible.The only downside was the long lines and waiting times, but overall, it was an amazing experience that we‚Äôll never forget. Highly recommend for families!"
Very long queues for rides.   Pizza and the pasta bolognese at the Stark cafe was awful.   Staff were friendly and helpful.   I would not recommend it as an attraction unless it is for very young children who seemed to enjoy the parade at 5:30PM.
Terrible customer service - payment taken 3 times by Disney which left us penniless with our two young children and still  not refunded  12 days later! Family of four split up for Princess breakfast which paid extra for! We had to return home as no money - at resort we were  told there was nothing they could do we had to email but we were unlikely to get a  response for at least 48 hrs. We received an automated email and are still waiting for our overpayment to be refunded 12 days later! Shane on you Disney!
"*Fantastic, extraordinary ‚Ä¶.Don‚Äôt miss it if u come to Paris. You can get there by train easily by about 4‚Ç¨I think it‚Äôs better to set a complete day for your visit and suggest you stay there till the night to see the Beauty of lightening too.It has 4 part: Frontier-land, Adventure-land,fantasy-land and discovery-land. I like fantasy and adventure more than the others.These places were more interesting to me:*Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril*Sleeping Beauty Castle*Pirates of the Caribbean*Pinaccio*Peter Pan's FlightYou can eat there by normal and average price.*Considering there is no place to charge your mobile except a place called ‚ÄúArcade alpha‚Äù (you can find it in the map) so go there with full charge mobile and your charger.*You should buy a ticket by 54‚Ç¨ and there is no need to pay more anywhere in any station. It‚Äôs priced is really fair.*The staffs are so friendly and supportive ‚ù§Ô∏è*Dress comfort and easy specially your shoes because you will have a long walking.*If you have kids take stroller and don‚Äôt take them to strange and dark places, some of the attractions may be offensive or scary for them.*The lines are too busy but you can pay more at the city hall and skip the lines üòêit‚Äôs too bad because they show the children: you can pass others by money üòí I think it‚Äôs not a good idea for making money, they can change the entrance price to the upper price to earn more, but act to all in a same way. It‚Äôs a bad role model for children so I decided to give 3 star to wonderful Disney land.* people have to stay in a long line for a 2 minute show or train, it‚Äôs no frustrating specially for the kids.* no need to get your."
"Disney land is an emotional roller coasterThere are times when you are in there where you think it's wonderful and then times when it is a bit of a nightmare My experience was that Disney land brings out the worst in people, most people are ordinary folks who have worked so hard   to get their families in here and they are desperately trying to get their money's worth, there is an under tone of desperation from people, running around trying to avoid long queues, trying to keep kids warm in freezing temperatures, screaming toddlers straped into prams ,  people worn out from queuing for 80 minutes for a 2 minute ride , it's quite soul destroying at times .  The merchandise in the shops is beyond over priced , don't feel the pressure to buy anything they are ripping you off so badly its kind of upsetting as it's heart breaking for us minions who are trying to experience the "" Disney magic "" My tip is download app before you go and familiarise yourself with it , you can check queue times on app , pick 3 rides a day you really want to go on and pay for fast track , it cuts about 20 minutes of your wait Bring in a phone bank for mobile as the app saps life out of phone Prepare yourself for long long long queues , so long I honestly can't see the point in going, it was so disappointing , try and bring in your own water and food as Disney food is not good, unless you book restaurants which I believe are nice but I shudder to think what they cost Be prepared for people vaping all the time , lovely big blow backs of some vile strawberry flavour 2nd hand smoke in your face constantly, Disney seriously wake up and ban vaping it's disgusting Also so many people taking photos obviously for their socials so they can show the world their "" Disney dream "" one lady actually asked me and my son to move so she could take multiple shots of herself with Disney in background, we were just taking a small break and taking in the surroundings , it was very annoying The whole thing has become about people  getting photos for social media pretending to the word that they are living the dream Unless you earn massive money avoid this place , it bleeds you dry"
I had planned our visit extensively for our visit on 23 December and thought I was ready.  We had purchased return transfers from Gare du Nord but on the day at the designated pick up spot  we were met by a Disney rep and had to walk 500 metres to another location to meet the bus.  Sense of arrival was great and we loved  the Christmas tree and decorations.  Wait times were crazy even early in the day. One of the highlights was the queen of hearts maze.  We spent 90 minutes queuing for its a small world and then discovered you could buy individual fast passes for as cheap as 9 euros per person.  We did this for most major rides to save hours in the queues.  This could have been better promoted.  Crowds were next level.  We loved being able to buy champagne in Disney glasses at top of Main Street but surprised they only took cash.  Overall the kids enjoyed their visit.  Pirates of the Caribbean was popular. Poor signage getting back to our bus meant we missed it and had to get a BOLT
I just don‚Äôt know why - but for me there is no doubt that this has to be the 2 worst Disney parks there are. The park is one of the most beautiful ones - Details in every corner - lovely theming and classic attractions. BUT - the Disneyland park has not seen anything new within the last 30 years. Not a single attraction is state of the art.The wait times are beginning to get outrageous .. even during off season. Why ? Poor operations and questionable ride opening hours. As hotel guest you get early entry- unfortunately not a lot of attractions are available at that time - meaning that you wait just as much as you do if you don‚Äôt show up early. The same for closing - why do most attractions close at 17 ? Why - just to boost wait times for no reason. Once the parade is over with small kids - you just have to sit there and wait for the firework to finally happen. And what is the deal with pins and the guest service building ? Why take out the few things that are free and fun - but don‚Äôt cost anything‚Ä¶ not really magical. Why make a big fuzz about not being able to enter that building - same here artificial created wait times- inside the building are more staff members than 3 attractions combined ‚Ä¶ not sure what they are actually doing there.
"Bought a 2-park 3-day pass for Paris Disney and it was the first thing we did on a 6 week family adventure so expectations were high. Mid December and the park was decorated beautifully for Christmas, with lights, trees and fake snow down Main Street throughout the day. A few rides at both parks were under redevelopment which was a bit disappointing but we still had plenty to do. We're not big on thrill rides but did do Crush's coaster and Thunder Mountain which were lots of fun for these 2 teens and 50-somethings. The classics such as It's a Small World and Pirates of the Caribbean were great and the Ratatouille ride was fantastic (although not good for vertigo!). Food was average and overpriced, ride queues averaged 30 minutes (we did wait 50 for Crush's coaster), we could have paid for a fast pass but hubby was not keen given how much we'd already spent on entry tickets. The stage shows were next level and production values are high throughout the parks. My nearly 18 year old got to live her disney princess fantasies and the 14 year old boy was impressed with it all. The evening drone show is particularly good.Thankfully we bumped into a fellow Aussie who gave us some helpful advice about meals. So after wandering around aimlessly on day 1 we used the Disney app to its full advantage for days 2 and 3. On day 2 we booked lunch at the PYM kitchen all you can eat buffet. Even if booked out it's worth refreshing and keep trying because people do cancel. The food here was actually very good. On day 3 we prepaid for burgers at cafe Hyperion and skipped the main queue to go to click and collect, Well worth doing.Beware - there is a disney tax in everything and you WILL spend lots of money on merch! LOLOnce in a lifetime Disney trip! Despite the cost, will do it again."
"I am a young woman who was physically assaulted by a man my father‚Äôs age in Disneyland Paris in August 2024.I have been going to Disneyland Paris for years and many times but that was the last time I would step foot in there after how badly they dealt with this.I have emailed and showed pictures from the assault and it is all documented in guest relations and with the security there and the email I received back from them they may as well of said ‚Äúwho cares, not our problem‚Äù.The incident took place in August 2024 in the line for Mickey and the magician. I was with my two sisters and we were all lining up. A man grabs me by my arm in the line and tugs me backward to get in front of me. This left a huge bruise on my arm with indents of his fingers from the force. I began shouting please don‚Äôt touch me and he laughed and said I didn‚Äôt. His wife then got in my face and threatened me, and his son was yelling that his father didn‚Äôt. I was roaring crying and when we went inside I went and said it to the cast member. While I was telling the cast member the son came over and interrupted and said his father didn‚Äôt touch me. I asked the cast member for the security footage so I could show them exactly what I was talking about and I was disgusted that there is no video footage in the lines (which is absolutely shocking!).I told the cast member it was assault and I was visibly upset. She told me she would get someone after the show to come over and talk to us. Looking back now what horrific way of dealing with this. They let a man who assaulted a girl sit down and enjoy the show while I can‚Äôt breathe or enjoy the show as I had a panic attack.After the show we waited (myself and my sisters) and went to the girl and were told the family left (of course they did they ran as soon as possible) and the security were outside looking for him. Security were nice and took it seriously however why would this be allowed ? We allow people who assault others to sit and enjoy the show? So Disney only care about its money and not the safety. I went further and made the report to guest relations where o was given a fast pass for the show.Like seriously? A fast pass for a show I have trauma for now and could never line up on that. I suffer with anxiety and the distress this entire situation was for me to this day is upsetting. I didn‚Äôt go back to the park the next day out of fear. I have been having therapy for 5 months now on how to deal with queues and lines and get over the assault. I will try attach the picture and show you how bad my arm was left and how Disney allowed a violent man to watch a show and roam around the park not caring the distress caused to others.Disney you should be ashamed. I have told everyone high and low and warned people not to go. Before I told people I allowed a saving grace of their email to redeem how wrong they were. The reply as mentioned earlier basically said not their problem and I can try attach the picture of this too. Ruby from guest relations who responded did not care in the slightest. You wouldn‚Äôt get this treatment in Disney world where they bend over backwards to protect and help guests. Disgusted.Watch out for your safety if you go. They didn‚Äôt for me."
"Unfortunately due to the red warning storm we had in Scotland last Friday, our trip was cancelled by the airline. @disneylandparis refused on the Friday to move the date, or refund for the 2 day tickets for the Saturday.Incredibly poor for a childrens theme park, never mind with one with such a wonderful reputation. We rebooked the trip at great expense to visit again this weekend, but it seems we have to purchase 2 days tickets once again. I provided proof of our trip cancellation, but they were unwilling to assist. Incredibly surprised and disappointed by this decision, as is my 4 year old."
January trip but found parks to be absolutely heaving with ridiculous queues and hated every minute never again I‚Äôm sorry ‚Ä¶ paid for half board and food was awful it used to be superb. Shame on you Disney. As for our room ‚Ä¶ turned on TV and no Disney channel ??? Are you kidding ! We needed a chill and nothing in English other than CNN ? Will never return
"This was our very first time visiting Paris and Disneyland Paris. We just couldn't get enough of the whole experience. It was the highlight of our whole trip. All of us adults and kids are still dreaming of the whole experience. The staff was amazing and super helpful. Walt Disney Studios Avengers Campus with the theme song playing gave us goosebumps every single time as we are hardcore Marvel fans. The character performances were fabulous. If only we could get a prior notification when each character comes out on the street or the roof would have been fantastic. I couldn't beleive my eyes when I saw my favourite character Loki. I missed the show as I didn't know when it was happening. It was a minor hiccup compared to the whole next level experience with superb rides, the Disney stars on parade. The younger kids loved meeting Mickey and Princesses. The Avengers Flight force ride was out of this world. Since we had only 1 day to cover most activities we missed out on most. It was surprising it was still really crowded during winter but queues moved fairly quick. Unexpected meet with Captain Jack Sparrow was epic. He was so kind to stop and take a pic with me. Web Slinger, Ratatouille, Phantom Manor, Small World are few main rides we did. The other family went in all the kids rides on Disneyland Park. The lights how at 8pm was so magical and standing outside in the freezing cold was totally worth it. The restaurants werenot too crowded but we grabbed bites from trucks as we wanted to do more activities. Wish we had more time to do more rides as 1 day is definitely not enough for the 2 parks. Will need atleast 3 days. Next time we will definitely choose   to stay at a Disney Hotel so we can enjoy extra magic time before the general crowd. Using the Disneyland Paris app was also super easy. Will definitely give this wholesome family fun experience a 10 out of 10."
"Spent 2 days at dlp last week, alot of people saying that disney has lost its magic,I agree with this to a degree and it must up its game in regards to make sure guests have a magical time,hardly saw any members of staff roaming the park apart from the cleaners,also a big reason why the magic is lacking is the state of society in general, angry rude ignorant people, who have no regard for other visitors openly smoking and vaping anywhere they please, pushing anyone in there way,still we made the best of it and enjoyed disneyland Park only waiting between 5 and 20 mins for the rides we wanted, we visited 2 years ago and thought the parades and nighttime show was far better than this time,as for the studios we thought this was terrible far to much work going on and very over crowded with nowhere to walk or sit down so left after 30 minutes and returned to the other park,disney village was also undergoing a big refurbishment ,will probably wait a few years before returning when hopefully the refurbishment will be completed.."
From the first gate it reminds you of happiness and joy that all of us have been experiencing since we were little. Disney gives you your childhood memories and takes you back there.
Worst place their behaviour quality is not good staff was not good I would never recommend you all to visit over here because when the entry become full they only allow Europe passport holders not give the priority of tourist worst place worst everything
"Always have a magical time at Disneyland Paris, where the staff, the shows, the night illuminations really help with the magic. The new show really was good with the projections in the main street, which we already had experience in Disneyland California but this was so nostalgic and right into the heart, so a top feeling just before you leave the main park. Staff was great, food was good and snacks as well. Stayed at Sequoia for the 1st night, got a really nice room and had a really good experience at check in with Nuno Lui, who made sure to let us know the luggage could be transferred to Disneyland Hotel in the morning, which meant we got straight into the parks in the following day. I didn't know this so the fact that he paid attention to what I told him was gonna be our plan and tailored for us, was TOP. We had our bags in our room around 6pm, which was before dinner, so were able to get ready for our Manhattan experience with 0 fuss. Once in Manhattan, we had a great experience, where Nicolas took very good care of us, food was great and he made sure the dishes my wife picked didn't contain tomato, as she is allergic. We had a great experience at the Royal Banquet, or so we thought, but sadly, my wife got sick in the middle of the night. I know this is a buffet but I still feel once I told the staff she was allergic to tomato we should have been taken around the buffet to understand what she could eat, as she did her best to pick the dishes she thought didn't contain but this is a bit of a mission impossible, resulting in a really bad night before our last park day.We had a good experience at the Stark Industries and at the food carts we got around both parks for some nice snacking / small bites and also, at the Disney Village at the Steakhouse and Annette's.There are a few things to mention here that for me are the reason why this trip will never be a 5 start for me and my wife. I paid 85eur for a photopass for my 3 days and came home feeling like I paid 8.5eur per photo. There was 1 single magic spot in all our stay, never see photopass photographers anywhere, a lot of characters don't have this as well, so why are we being charged so much for it? The difference between Paris and the american parks is huge, I always come home with so many memories from the american parks photo wise and sadly with barely any from Paris. The price of premier access is insane, will have again to mention the genie in Disneyland California, which even includes photos!!!! and is so much cheaper than Paris. I'd definitely prefer to queue 5/10 minutes and have more people access it than feeling that you need to be rich to have access to these experiences. Also, there's still a lot of main rides not included with it, I think after paying so much this should really feel premier. Also, aware of the state of Walt Disney Studios right now with the re-theming and understanding with that but it does mean place gets too crowded in the few tunnels where we can pass to go from one side to the other of the park, and really not feeling a lot magical right now. We still enjoyed the attractions there and the pixar show is always a good experience. A bit disappointed with the night show, feeling like it's lacking and was a waste of our time."
"Ok, Where to start‚Ä¶ so me and my husband booked a last minute trip to Disneyland Paris. The whole experience from start to finish have been awful. The buses running to and from the hotels to Disneyland are not regular you will be waiting atleast 45 minutes for the bus, by then lots of people are waiting already and you are crammed onto the bus like sardines.  If you have anxiety or are claustrophobic AVOID getting the bus. And when going from Disney to the hotel you have people shouting TAXI TAXI TO HOTEL GOOD PRICE every 5 seconds which was incredibly draining and not what you need after a long day out. Going into Disneyland everything is extremely lackluster.  There‚Äôs a lot of walking but not really much entertainment or things to see on the way. No where to sit down and relax.  Hardly any cast members around.  A lot of park works going on at the moment with boards up and stuff blocked off.  A lot of the rides were shut for refurbishment.  Me and my husband booked a table to plaza gardens and was left to wait outside in the rain before 30 minutes had passed so we just left.  The food prices are ridiculous.  In the whole of Disney. Nothing is run correctly and honestly Disney should be ashamed of themselves.  French people in general are incredibly rude.  They push past you ,barge into you and they do not apologise.  Honestly this has been the worst holiday I have ever been on and I have been a lot of places.   I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anybody to visit Disneyland Paris.  Go to Disney world Florida instead don‚Äôt waste your money here because you will regret it.  SPEND IT ELSEWHERE! If I could give this place 0 stars I would We also stayed at the grand magic hotel which was not a good experience but that‚Äôs for another review."
I booked a one day park ticket for my little sister‚Äôs 21st Birthday and we were in re so excited to go. Unfortunately 3.5 days before we were supposed to go we were informed by our airline that there was a Status Red warning all flights would be either cancelled or delayed. We rescheduled our flights to 2 days later so we could still celebrate. I informed Disney immediately but because I was 6 hours outside the cancellation period there was nothing that could be done. For a company that is centred around family and celebration of we were shocked that they refused to even change the date by 2 days.I cannot believe that such a huge organisation whose focus is family fun would not even try to be accommodating in such unforeseen circumstances and has really left a negative impression with me and ruined a special birthday.
"Spent Monday-Friday last week here, unfortunately lots of things were closed without any previous notice. With it being -5 at times, there was no shelters, no cafes & there wasn‚Äôt really a Disney feel going on. Rides were constantly down in hour before it opened to the public so it was no use being early.The rides themselves were amazing but everything else wasn‚Äôt great."
"Been here six times as a family of 4 and can say the magic for us isnt there anymore. Disney really needs to sort out the que system!  So many people push in to catch up with their family instead of que together. Happened so many times the three days just barging past like you don't exsist, no excuse me or thank you. The last family had done this to us, 4 of them was in front of us then next minute at separate moments 7 of them barged past us, no manners, no excuse me just pushing past physically touching. We are not a argumentative couple but did end up having a confrontation with this spanish family and apparently we are 'british people' ...  For a family that have to que in all ques all day and not in special assistance it can be a long day especially in the cold with two small children and the constant rudeness and que pushing from certain people is ridiculous!!  So many selfish people around but they dont care as there is no enforcement.  Disney has also swapped the dream factory to a Minnies Musical moment, what a rubbish swap! Such a poor show especially if you have seen the dream factory!! It is a standing show and i wouldnt rush to que as we was near the front but once you go first room you are pushed back with everyone rushing in a small door pushing you. Buzz ride is still backing up and you feel like you stop so much.Spiderman broke the first time but fortunately the staff kindly let us go again.Characters are a bit limited. We went to see Minnie mouse and luckily got there when we did as they shut the que off. It was a long wait as special assistance line was also full.We have been to both disneyland paris and disneyworld Orlando many times and would recommend you save your money and visit Orlando! Stayed in hotel Cheyenne which was disappointing and room wasn't clean, only good thing is its a walk away and magic hour."
"Fourth time here, and probably the last time. It was a terrible experience. Lack of animation in the streets, very poor. Waiting times specially for young kids it should be some kind of animation to help children enduring the waiting times. Restaurants that we tried overpriced and very poor food quality . Only show that we really enjoyed was the Parade as we went home shortly afterwards . Poor ‚Ä¶ very poor experience ."
"DLP is a waste of time, half of the rides & restaurants are closed, which means that you have no shelter from the freezing -2 weather at the moment. It‚Äôs full prices for half services, which is absolutely disgraceful. Disney should be ashamed of themselves although they don‚Äôt care one bit. Even the Disney shops look second rate, more like a character shop at the premium outlet in Florida than a proper Disney store."
Brilliant place not really into Disney but this place has so much to see and do must admit I did enjoy the studios more than the park myself but kids enjoyed it all and that‚Äôs the main thing.
"We went to Disneyland Paris on 18th January. We started in Disney studios and were let down that a lot of rides and attractions were closed for modernisation and renovation. Most of the Avengers campus was closed and Spiderman web ride was down due to technical issues. Also, the Disney characters were actively ignoring certain children, and not one cast member attempted to stop any queue jumping, in fact they condoned it by then pulling the children first who queue jumped! We moved over to Magic Kingdom which was a lot better managed, more fun, and generally better maintained. Other than the cold temperature i cannot fault Magic KingdomWe opted for Steak dinner in the Silver Spoon steakhouse which was delicious and we got a birthday cake for my son, the servers made sure to sing happy birthday too"
"So our daughter wanted us to come to DLP with her and our young grandson, as we‚Äôve done Disney World around 30+ times we said ok. What an absolute waste of money, Disney Studios only us 50 percent open you can walk round it in 15 minutes, queued to get a photo with both Antman and Goofy but obviously queuing is not something the French understand as if kids where in a Disney costume the characters brought them to the front and other little ones were pushed to the back, blatantly rude why would people pay for this I do not know. Went over then to the Magic Kingdom, which was better but again so many things closed and so many restaurants not open. We also went to the Silver Spur steakhouse cost ‚Ç¨180, for a second rate meal although we did pay ‚Ç¨25 for a birthday which was very nice.Truthfully this trip has cost me ¬£2k, when honestly it‚Äôs not been worth ¬£1k. Disney I think need to realise that when your only offering 1/2 the service why should the guests pay full price. In all in this is a waste of money and never again after this would I visit a Disney theme park."
"Went at Halloween 24, never seen it as busy, queued for absolutely everything, 1 hour 30 for 1 crappy ride in particular, ruined the experience for the entire family, wud never go back. Disney let about 10000 people 2 many into the parks, absolute joke, pure greed"
"We visited Disneyland Paris for the 13th time for 2 days (arrived on December 9th and left early on December 11). We were also visiting with two priority cards on green.The Disneyland park never disappoints. In just over half a day we were able to do all the rides (except Pinocchio and Casey Junior as they were closed).The Christmas decorations throughout the park were great, especially down Main Street.Walt Disney Studios is a great park with many good rides. The rides are normally doable in around 3 and a half hours (if not a busy day) and with a priority card 2 and half hours. We love the park but sadly a lot of Walt Disney Studios is boarded up which was a shame but we did find out during the visit it is apparently because of the renaming of the park to Disney Adventure land.The food at both parks can be unpredictable; it can either be the best you've ever had or the worst. Unfortunately, the Disney parks are not very accommodating for people with coeliac disease (gluten free). At many fast-food restaurants in the park (like Bella Notte), our only options were salads/vegan food or microwave meals that resembled and tasted like baby food. At buffets you also only have a small option of foods.Most of the staff members are very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. However, there were a few staff members who weren't very friendly.For instance, while we were getting off Big Thunder Mountain, a family member accidentally dropped their phone onto the tracks. Although we knew it wasn‚Äôt a ideal situation, they could have been more understanding and friendly. They didn't keep us informed about what was happening. When we tried to explain the situation, they just shrugged, as if to say, ""What am I supposed to do?"" We stood there without any information for quite some time and got the impression that they were annoyed with us as they kept shaking their heads at us and rolling their eyes. It would have been helpful if a staff member had quickly/briefly explained what would happen next and didn't do those gestures towards us, especially since the person who dropped the phone was only struggling to get out because she is disabled. Despite the behavior of a few workers, the majority of the staff were very helpful.The priority card generally works well, but halfway through, we realized that the green color assigned to one of our family members was not correct, as she was having difficulty with the steps and getting in and out of the ride vehicles. We were unsure what to do with the card as it wasn't the correct colour. Having the green card meant we used both the premier queue and if there wasn't one we used the disabled queue. Most of the premier queues only skip half of the main queue and then merge into the normal queue. In our opinion, there should be a staff member present at every ride where the premier queue merges with the normal queue, as we faced challenges with this merging process. For example , on the Indiana Jones ride, no one wanted to let us into the queue. When we finally found a space to join, a group behind us started pointing and yelling that we had ""just pushed in,"" which attracted unwanted attention and made us feel uncomfortable. The merging experience often leads to awkwardness since people are reluctant to let you join the line. A staff member's presence would greatly alleviate this situation.Another issue we encountered was at the ride ""Le Pays des Contes de F√®es"" (the storybook boats next to Casey Jr.). The boarding area for disabled guests has a significant gap and step between the platform and the boat, making it very challenging for those with disabilities. Staff members had to physically help everyone out of the boat. In contrast, the area where guests in the normal queue board actually has a smaller gap. It would be ideal to add something like a removable platform to make exiting the boat easier. On our second attempt at riding the ride, we went through the normal queue, which meant there was a smaller step the boat as the gap wasn't as big but the actual queue stairs and the moving boat were then an issue.Queue jumping can be a significant issue in the parks, we noticed it more in the disabled queues. For instance, While we were in the disabled queue, a mother instructed her son to run past us and duck under the barriers to get ahead in line. She then pushed us aside while waving her disabled pass in our faces, insisting that her disability allowed her to go in front of us. We tried to explain that it was a queue for everyone with a disabled pass and that it's not acceptable to push ahead or send children under the barriers then catch up. Two staff members saw this happen but did not do anything, for a brief second it looked like one of the workers was going to say something but he then backed down. The workers continued to watch, and one of them eventually walked away. The worker then allowed that family on the ride before us, despite witnessing them send their under the barrier and push past us. We also had people try push in front of us on several other rides (The Parachutes, Crushes Coaster, The Story boats) . When We were waiting for the Toy Soldiers Parachute ride in the disabled queue a large family of over 25 members in front of us repeatedly rode in groups, and when each ride ended, the group would quickly run off the ride and past everyone in the disabled queue to rejoin their relatives. This meant we were in the queue for 40 minutes and if the queue didn‚Äôt move. Thankfully on the parachutes, Crushes Coaster and the boats the worker made sure whoever was queues up first could go on first. However, sadly some workers like the slinky dog worker choose not to do or say anything at all. The Christmas parade was amazing. It was wonderful to see the festive floats lit up in the dark and the characters in their Christmas outfits. We arrived an hour early to secure front-row views. It's definitely worth the wait.The fireworks were good. It was our first time watching them in over seven years, but we were a bit disappointed to see that not much had changed. However, if you haven't seen the fireworks before, you will likely enjoy them! The Notre-Dame de Paris show was nice to watch, and it was exciting to experience something new. The Notre-Dame show was only on for a few days, so we feel fortunate to have attended. Although the Notre-Dame show replaced the usual drone show, we would still love to see the drone show someday, as we have never had the chance to watch it before.The shops at Disneyland Paris are really pricey, but you kind of expect that at Disneyland. There's not a ton of variety in what they sell, and it feels like most of it is just Stitch-themed stuff, which kind of takes away from the overall selection.I would definitely recommend a visit for all ages. There are things to do for every age group. There are many rides for thrill seekers as well as numerous rides that are slow and gentle. Even if you don't like rides there is lots of things to do like meet & greets, watch shows and parades, walk round the labyrinth, castle and also loads of photo opportunities"
The Park itself was excellent but the problem was we stayed for the display and it was late starting. The crowds were unmanageable. I saw one woman have a panic attack as she tried to leave and get through the crowds. We also tried to leave as were afraid we would miss our train ‚Ä¶there was no way out other than going through the crowds. I emailed Disney and got no reply. Just want people to know if you stay for the fireworks you cannot leave until it ends . If it is delayed you will have to wait as there is no way to get out . I would not stay for the fireworks as it was not worth the distress
"Yes, the lights are pretty and the music is Christmassy, but do you like to see Characters outdoors and actually like to eat? - Then forget it. Saw no characters outdoors all day - you'll only get to see them if you can get indoors and find somewhere to eat, but the places are always packed full, blocked by staff who'll say all day ""Sorry, we're full."" We got to the park really early and spent the day starving and judging by the misery of other people, so did they. Queues for rides are too long and it's December folks. Half of the studios was closed and what remained was underwhelming. Could barely see the castle show, as it was so rammed, so we really wished we hadn't waited until 10pm and left at 3:30pm when we were going to. This isn't the first time we've been to Disneyland Paris, but we wont be going again. A lot of money to walk around a bog standard theme park, cold and hungry."
"Another dream come true!! After 33 years of waiting I finally made it to Disneyland Paris! Like Disneyland USA our 1st ride was Space Mountain (Hyperspace Mountain) was which better than expected.  Some of the other highlights were the Dragon under the Castle, Dinner at Walt‚Äôs, BTMRR, Pirates and of course Illuminations at night. It‚Äôs now my 2nd favorite Disney Park that I have visited.."
"My husband, 5 year old son and I stayed for 2 nights in Disneyland Hotel and I feel disappointed as it was very overpriced for what we got. We had so many issues with our room, the door didn‚Äôt lock and had to be repaired twice, the phone cable was broken so frustrating when I tried calling reception, the jug didn‚Äôt work and every time we had an issue we had to go down to reception with took ages because the lifts are so slow. The manager gave us a late checkout but that was more stressful than it was worth as our keys stopped working after 11am‚Ä¶ so we had to go to reception twice and they still didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ we were lucky to find a cleaner to let us in so we could get our luggage to leave because I didn‚Äôt want to go back down to reception. The whole experience with the hotel was frustrating and very disappointing. The service was definitely not 5 star as we didn‚Äôt have a turn down service on the 2nd night so no fresh cups and restocking of the complimentary mini bar. As for the food, it was good but overpriced for what you get. Lucky we had the half board so not as bad but we‚Äôve had a lot better in France.As for the parks, we were lucky not to have to line up more than half hour for each ride but it‚Äôs an exhausting day trying to fit everything in. The cold weather didn‚Äôt help. There aren‚Äôt any nice cafes to sit and rest which was disappointing. Too many merchandise shops and not enough focus on comfort.Would we come back, no."
"Dont get me wrong, Disney is a magical place for all ages. There is always plenty of magical parades / shows and something always going on.However sadly they are slowly pricing out anyone whos not got lots of moneyThe longer you go the cheaper the admission, but most people only go for 1 or 2 days and admission costs on excess of ¬£100 for an adult per day. When its busy if you want rides and there are big queues you probably wont think that you have your moneys worth.Disney used to do a fast pass system where you got a time for a ride and could join the quick queue once you done that you could get another for another ride, but not before so that everyone got a fair chance, but now this has been scrapped and you can pay a premium price to join the fast lane for all rides, so therefore another perk for those who can afford it and not for the ordinarys.That and the expensive food and drink when you are in. You can fill your own water bottles (if you can find a working station) and bring your own food in but if you are spending all day there it can be heavy carrying lots of food.We used to go most years but it may be quite a long time before we return again"
"Awful experience, near to Surreal. 1.Terrible atmosphere 2.Don‚Äôt waste your money,This is my first time at Disneyland Paris, I have been to Disney World America twice I would rather pay the extra money and go back to the USA,.If you‚Äôre looking for a Disney experience this is far from it, 90% Of the staff are not friendly whatsoever they do not smile or have that known Disney happy attitude, they do not want to make eye contact and are Very unhelpful. Just one example, if they don‚Äôt know the answer to your question, they don‚Äôt even bother to seek help, they just shrugged their shoulders.Restaurants are shocking prices and disgustingly dirty, not just because they have a large volume of people using them, this is more like long-term dirt, the food is very low quality in every restaurant. Surrounding tourists‚Ä¶ It was almost like walking into a film, People were physically pushing (not bumping into you) and shoving walking around the Disney park and restaurants to another level, how there isn‚Äôt a fight I will never know.I‚Äôve Never experienced this to this level whether that be Disney world, Shopping at Christmas at a busy shopping mall, Night out on the town/clubs, this was really surreal, and it‚Äôs not just because of overcrowding, the people were pure rude, for example if you opened a door for shops or restaurants people would just physically push pass your family and walk in or out, with no manners and No thank you! IF YOU WANT TO RUIN YOUR DISNEY EXPERIENCE THIS IS THE PLACE!"
We had high expectations of Disneyland but were left disappointed. Not a single character was seen roaming around. The only time we saw any was during the parade and that was for a total of 2 mins and were not seen again. Majority of the rides were closed as were other shops. This was such a waste of time for us. We only managed to get onto 2 rides and during this other rides were also closing shop hours before the firework display. The firework was the only thing worth seeing. We will not be returning.
"Surprise visit to Disneyland Paris before the ride renovations started on 6/1, there is a lot of building work ongoing that others have mentioned. The Big Thunder Mountain ride was shut for most of the day (now closed for months for annual maintenance) and we had to pay for fast passes to get on it, no problem as best ride in the park.Very busy in the park on 4/1 with Christmas season finishing a day later. However able to do some rides we thought we would not get on, including Pinocchio, Peter Pan and Snow White. Some rides stupid times (Buzz Lightyear 80 minutes) for what they were.Weather was good for most of the day, some rain later which meant the drone show was cancelled but the light show was good, fireworks good as usual. Don‚Äôt bother with the parade, complete waste of time.Other gripe was Minnie was no where to be seen, replaced by Stitch at the usual character meet, sacrilege. Forced into Mickey character meet (2 hours).This place is still magical, however maybe next visit will be in a couple of years at least. Recommended."
"A magical experience with your children, the good thing about being a kid is they don‚Äôt notice things that an adult does in regards to quality, price etc. a lot of walls up for maintenance but again kids not bothered or even noticed. The whole place is so clean and has that magical feeling in the air seeing the kids faces light up at almost every turn makes it amazing so credit must go to the place.With the adult head on I must warn and be frank when I say the place once through the gates is disgustingly overpriced, for example absolutely everything is fast food at Michelin prices! We were ¬£65 for 3 microwave pizzas and a portion of pasta that was rank rotten! That‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg! The full place is just a glutton for money absolutely nowhere nice to just sit and have a drink or if you fancy a bite in a nice atmosphere, ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù are a mess with chairs and tables scattered everywhere but to be fair that‚Äôs not the staffs fault as it‚Äôs the clientele that visit the place that are so ignorant and entitled‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a place that highlights all what‚Äôs wrong with the modern world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶people would rather experience it through filming on their phones, folk constantly in the way and barging past for ‚Äòthe perfect pic‚Äô‚Ä¶..a girl was even texting whilst on a ride getting whizzed round whilst furiously typing‚Ä¶..we went to the show called ‚Äòtogether‚Äô which was amazing really well done and fabulous for the kids and grown ups too I may add‚Ä¶..full grown man row in front sat with EarPods in throughout!! Great place for kids ages 4 and above anything younger would say be a bit pointless.Be prepared to be annoyed unless you have a phone glued to your hand and are immune to being in the moment."
"We travelled here with our daughter, son in law and his parents and our granddaughters.  This was my husband and I‚Äôs 3rd visit to Disneyland Paris and this was for a double birthday celebration.  They have been more times than us. We always stay in the Newport Bay Hotel.  Although the public areas appear updated, the rooms certainly haven‚Äôt been.  The rooms are clean enough, and the beds are very comfortable, but the furniture is in a very poor state. The drawers are very hard to open and get stuck all the time and it all looks well knocked with marks. My family remarked it had not changed in the 10 years they‚Äôve been going there. All the furniture is old and marked, the carpets could do with a wash as ‚Äòcrunchy‚Äô in places.  The casement window fell off when we tried to get some fresh air in. We had to wedge it back.  The drainage in the bath and sink was extremely slow. The hotel staff were,however, lovely and nothing was too much trouble. I would especially like to commend Fiona from the Concierge desk who went above and beyond to secure an electric mobility chair from a trusted outside source for me as I am awaiting a knee replacement and my husband and family were struggling with push type wheelchairs obtained from the Stroller shop which were not designed for this extensive kind of use.  If you need a wheelchair, see the Concierge and they can arrange the delivery of ECV from their trusted local pharmacy at very reasonable rates. The concierge also recharge your appliance for you every night when you come in for the evening with no fee. So, venturing into the two parks we noticed immediately there is extensive building work being undertaken everywhere.  Studio Universal seems to have been brought up to standards we expect with a few fast rides and digital experiences in a much more modern setting although a lot is still under wraps for refurbishment.  Queues for nearly all rides range from 55 minutes to two hours.  The Magic Kingdom, Frontierland and surrounding areas seem to just be the same and our granddaughters (aged 10 & 12) found the rides a bit tame.  More suitable for younger children I think.  Nothing has changed there at all. A lot of the rides kept being closed for technical difficulties. Indiana Jones was the only fast coaster. Thunder Mountain appears to be closed for the foreseeable future.   A lot of the food kiosks and eateries were shut. This was troublesome as the weather was awful most of the time and a nice warm drink was hard to find.  The whole place was fully booked out so it‚Äôs not like it was a quiet season. The shops seemed to have less selection than on our last visit but the prices were very high.  Again, the parks were kept clean and the public toilets always clean. Queueing time much the same in all the parks.  Sadly, because the weather was so wet nearly all the parades were cancelled and that was disappointing. There was a distinct lack of characters in the parks as well. The meet and greets in the designated places were still there but with very long queues, which in the icy rain wasn‚Äôt pleasant and our youngest got too cold standing still waiting so didn‚Äôt get half as many autographs in her book as she had hoped. Would highly recommend you take your own crisps as at ‚Ç¨6 a packet it can be costly for a snack!  We all  agreed that for us, the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô is missing in what is essentially a special place for young and old to escape from everyday life.  This is just another theme park for day trippers of which there were loads! It may be a different story when all the refurbishments have been completed but I feel that will be a few years down the line.  It was full of French and Europeans. Very few visitors from the UK."
"We surprised the children on Christmas Day and Christmas became even more magical for the family with a trip to Disneyland Paris. It has been without doubt our best Christmas ever and we loved all the Christmas decorations, shows, parades and the overall atmosphere. Highly recommend a trip for an extra special Christmas. It‚Äôs cold so wrap up warm and be prepared to queue so have snacks and games ready for the kids!"
Booked for the whole day and both parks. The smaller and more modern park had the newer Disney franchises and we attempted a number of rides. Always said no roller coasters but those we went on were not too scary. Luckily they were inside and in the dark. The second park more traditional and the rides less exciting. Waited through to the two light shows. Best advice. Remember where you parked as the rush at leaving is massive. Worthwhile visit but missed Micky and Minnie
"First time at DLP for Christmas and what an experience ... the shows, the lights, the food were all fantastic (...the weather, not so much ... make sure you pack trousers!)We would absolutely go back for another New Years parade, the children loved it as much as we did, just so much to do!We stayed in the Santa Fe this time, and found the whole place clean and comfortable with great facilities for what you need whilst there (the only downside was no English-speaking TV channels except for the same 4 episodes of Timon and Pumbaa Wild about Safety!).100% recommend everything!"
"My first visit to Disneyland Paris began amazing up until the end of the day when we were told that there would be no drones for the illuminations. We waited until the end of the illuminations in hope that fireworks would occur, but sadly they did not. Due to weather conditions which would have been known much earlier during the day as it was pouring with rain and windy the entire time I was there, it wasn‚Äôt until the very end of the show we were told that due to wind, the fireworks would not occur. Whilst listening to ‚ÄòA dream is a wish your heart makes‚Äô, Disneyland Paris took my dream of wanting to see fireworks and crushed them. I am also very upset that Disneyland would have known fireworks would not be present prior to the show and did not state this until 8pm in which I and other families would have stayed and spent extra money on dinner as they waited for a show that unbeknown would not happen. If known earlier, I would have went home and enjoyed the rest of my day, rather than waste half my day waiting for fireworks. I cannot imagine how younger children felt or those who spent extra money to be placed at the front to view the show."
No words can explain the amazing and magical experience!!You have to see it and enjoy it by yourself!!
"terribly long lines, the food is scarse and small portions and way overpriced. It is an overall ripoff,  Also they yell at you in French are are visibly upset if you can't speak french."
"Having been there for Halloween 7 years prior - we were super excited to see Disney at Christmas. Would not recommend. There are crowds everywhere for everything. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel, as we had before, but the service and perks that were available then are no longer now. We opted for a superior deluxe family room for 5 and that too was a mistake. The amount you pay is not justified in any way (no close park access, no free daily fast pass for a ride, no special amenities for the kids or us. We went for new years, no special celebration at the hotel, if you want a nice dinner you won‚Äôt make a good spot at the park for the fireworks‚Ä¶ it was all in all disappointing. Obviously the team idea in general are good, the atmosphere as well. So not going for a negative rating."
"The ticket price is high.  About 290 Euros for a family of three where, jokingly, a teenage son is viewed as an adult.Once inside, I found staff to be generally rude.  We were stood waiting for the ""Parade"", something we waited 45 minutes for.  Then, along come the men in red jackets, telling us to move.  Even though we were stood in the same position as other families.  When I moved forward to ask them why we had to move when we were in line with other visitors, I looked around and our place had already been taken by others.  Did they move that family on?  Nope.  And merely for questioning why my family were being treated differently to others, I was surrounded by two security guards who tried to intimidate me.  All for the princely sum of 290 Euros.Queues for rides are long, and not well documented.  Imagine queuing 1 hour for a train ride, only to find that the queue is for a boat ride.  Were there any staff we could ask about why we were queuing.  No.  Were we the only ones thinking we were queuing for a train ride.  No.  Others were too.Also, during the stay, a lot of things were closed, or ""being improved for our future enjoyment"".  A bit of a joke, really, considering for most of us it is a once in a lifetime visit.DisneyLand in HongKong was a million times better, more polite, and more organised than this complete joke of a park in Paris.  The one great thing was the nighttime fireworks and electric show.  However, you have to arrive 1 hour in advance if you want to get to see  that too.  Basically everything is 1 hour, even at the start of the day,  Rides often last 2 minutes, no more than 5.For one ride we queued 45 minutes and suddenly they opened another lane which meant about 30 people who  were behind us were now in front of us.  A similar thing happened for the boat ride.  I am not talking about the people who pay extra for ""priority"", they just suddenly opened new lanes and let other people jump ahead.Look, I am not going to dissuade anyone from visiting DisneyLand.  All I am saying is that it is overpriced, poorly organised, and staffed by people who seem to be as miserable as many of the visitors looked.  Head to the HongKong one if you can."
"Thourghly enjoyed our trip. We stayed for 3 nights and had 4 days in the parks. Loved every minute. It was much busier than I expected and the queues were quite long. Fortunately the weather was very good, sunny but cold. On our departure very sad to leave, still lots of things we hadn't got around to. I  think my son and family, who we travelled with, will return."
"I am afraid that Disneyland Paris has gone downhill over the past few years. Having worked there in the early 2000s, and had more recent visits as a Mum with a family, I can see a stark difference. This park (of all Disney parks) now has the worst ratio of guest numbers to rides, meaning the queues are impossible. Small children cannot be expected to wait one hour for any single experience. Also, on our visit in early January 2025, there were numerous areas boarded for new construction, which should have been staggered, as it really detracts from the ""magic"". In addition, the ""Magic Hour"" (guests of Disney hotels are allowed access to the parks one hour before any non hotel guests), is now pointless, as only 3 rides opened within this hour. This was the same for each of the 3 days we tried. The management of this park have tipped many aspects into the negative, which unfortunately means the Disney magic is just not alive in this park. Despite previously being a complete advocate, I will not return to DLP. There are other parks in Europe, of other brands, that would offer much better value for money."
"A TOTAL RIPOFF !DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.Went to both Parks on 27 and 28 December 2024.Park Fully Booked over crowding- a case of pack them in - we have already got your ticket money when the reservation was made.Refurbishment work to 4 or 5 Rides and hence closed, meaning that all visitors crammed onto what Rides remained.With reduced capacity, they should have reduced the number of visitors.Freezing temperature and hence unable to sit on outside seats - totally inadequate seating inside any of the covered spaces; no benches in the queues of over 60 minutes for each Ride.No facilities to just bug a Coffee and sit for 10 minutes - they only want you to reserve in a restaurant and pay double the price compared to other restaurants outside the Parks.In one of their Theatre Shows, we were parked in with no seats, like a Cattle Truck.At the end of each of the two days, all of us were totally exhausted.Go to Efftelling or Six Flags instead - it's better value for money."
A family group of 10 persons ranging from age 5 to nearly 80 yrs old. Kids loved it despite long wait times on some of the attractions.
"Had an amazing time at Disneyland Paris! üé¢üè∞‚ú® The rides, the magic, and especially the grand closing fireworks made it unforgettable. Highly recommend this trip for anyone looking for a magical getaway! üéÜüí´ #DisneylandParis #MagicalMoments"
"We were excited to go to Disneyland, we purchased one day ticket, we chose to go to Disneyland Park.  We added the bus transportation.  So to start off, i wasn't able to download the tickets so I asked for help and one of the person that works there simply said go outside and download, which i still was not able to do.  I tried with different person and he was kind enough to help us.  The parade WAS SO SAD in comparison to the Florida Disney and the California one.  It was not what we expected.  The waiting online was not so bad, however the wait for the pics with characters was long.  It was a  very cold, day we didn't stay the whole day and took the train back to Paris which was SO EASY and direct.  There were not characters out for pictures, there are more shops  than anything. I was expecting the characters out and about so we can take pictures."
Worst holiday have ever experienced got taken back in ques as my son was questioned on height to be then told he's tall enough join back of the que staff were very rude and unhelpful avoid this place like the plague go to the America disneyland because this one is a dirty horrible environment...hotel was dirty used coffee pods in coffee machine tiles missing on the roof and the hotel room flooded from the bath leaking absolutely terrible experience
I loved it amazing the rides were amazing the hotel was amazing i went here for my birthday I loved it ü•∞ Should go there it is amazing I promise you
"Customer support just horrible. Waited more than half an hour on hold without any answer while calling on a paid line. Really terrible that to cancel a booking there is no other way than to call them on a French phone number which is not free, so the longer you wait in line the more you have to pay.An easy way to cancel your reservation online should be mandatory. This is not that advanced or difficult to implement. Fix your stuff"
"We are a family of 5. One child has ADHD and has his own access pass. One child has arthritis and has his own access pass as he likes thrill rides and other child does not. If you are entitled to a pass, get one, it's a game changer! If you didn't apply for one before you left the UK, take diagnosis documents with you and you can do there.We had a great experience with the passes. We rarely had to queue and this made our time here brilliant. Without them, I think all 5 of us would have not have had fun because of the nature of our family. We loved the rides!We loved the Disney magic. The cast members were great. We did not have one negative experience. We did experience one break down of a ride. We were on Pirates of the Carribean and the ride broke down. It took around 40 minutes for this resolved. The cast members wee great. This is something that they were used to as this ride regularly breaks down which points to a need to address is as people around us who had limited time were affected more by this. It's on every review but worth a mention..the cost of food is so high. We would have liked some hot fries so we could eat on the go but this proved difficult. At times we wanted a hot drink and this was not as easy to get as it should be.In some areas there was not enough seating. In one restaurant, there were rows of chairs but this area was closed. This is frustrating when you just want to sit and eat your food. We visited Florida last year and we naturally compared the parks.The Lion King show is better. Space Mountain is a better ride.Tower of Terror is much, much better. It is very dramatic!We didn't Ratatouille was quite as good but we still really enjoyed it. Overall, we have had a great few days here."
"Momma Mia !  I had to visit Paris Disneyland  no IF or But ! so I can bragging to  every one I  truly  been to all six Disneyland resort around the world , from Asian , USA  and Europe , USA is the best and bigger , I find Paris and Tokyo  location little small and very expensive compared  to USA , but still the Happy place in the world , fun to visit young  or old , Disneyland  Paris  is  made up  two park , Disneyland  Park and Walt Disney Studio , mountain of people very popular in Europe , some ride is over 60 mins wait ! do not set your expectation too high , you will 100%  disappointed special you been to USA resort ,  enjoy it , for a bottle of Coke is about $7 ,  we did not stop in any restaurants wait is too long ! so eat fully early before you visit here ! you need less two days to see Paris ! it is our final X'mas Holiday ! we been away since DEC 17 !  Happy New Year Every one ! Bonne Annee !"
Can‚Äôt believe this place had mice everywhere.. The staff were obviously ok with this cos they had even dressed them up in bloody clothes .. we left immediately. When I complained the staff laughed in my face.
"It was an extraordinary experience, I really enjoyed it, it's a shame that the time was very short and I didn't get to do all the games in DISNEYLAND, and the prices in the stores were acceptable."
"Staff were great, hotel was great but the visit to the Park was stressful due to overcrowding, wait times and many attractions being closed."
Overcrowded ‚Ä¶the queues for some of the attractions are over 2 hours . No matter which attraction you choose the waiting time is at least 1 hour. it does not worth the money .Never ever again. Waste of time and money.
"I have visited nearly all the Disney parks, and unfortunately, Disneyland Paris ranks lowest on my list. My family and I went there during Christmas, hoping for a ""magical"" experience filled with holiday cheer, but instead, we encountered poor service that soured our visit. The cast members in other Disney parks have always been lovely and charismatic, so I had high expectations for Disneyland Paris. However, the cast members here rarely smiled and often displayed unfriendly attitudes.At Pizzeria Bella Notte, the cashier seemed annoyed that we ordered the menu deal first instead of √† la carte, as though we were supposed to know the sequence that would make her job easier. Her attitude was off-putting and frankly gave me the ick. If entering orders is challenging, perhaps some training would help, rather than blaming the customers.Later, we had dinner at the Royal Pub, which was one of the worst service experiences I‚Äôve ever had at any Disney park. Our waiter ignored us, even after I repeatedly asked for tap water. Meanwhile, he promptly attended to the family sitting next to us, taking their order without hesitation. When I finally managed to get his attention again and reminded him I had already asked for water twice, he insisted I had asked for ice instead. Instead of apologizing for neglecting us, he gaslit us and continuously interrupted me, which was both unprofessional and infuriating.I was appalled by the cast members' lack of hospitality. Disneyland Paris would benefit from implementing better training programs to improve their staff's customer service and ensure the ""magic"" Disney is known for is consistently delivered."
"We stayed at the Disney Hotel for 2N/3D. The hotel is really beautiful, luxurious and conveniently located right at the entrance to the Disneyland. The service levels were a disappointment, it was not upto five star standard, We were there the nights before Christmas, the park was decorated in festival lights. The parade was awesome! They made efforts to spread the festive cheer in all shows and parades. The flip side was lot of crowd, long waiting times for rides and shows. We took Premier access which helped to gain quick entry with just few minutes waiting, it was worth the money.There are renovations going on in both Disneyland & Disney Studios. So could not experience all the shows and rides. Fortunately the weather was dry for most part of our stay."
It was magical!If you ever go to France you must visit disneyland paris!!Be aware though it will be expensive specially if you have children with you.
Disney has gone so far downhill - just do not go - no Xmas atmosphere. Disney staff not friendly - it's Xmas - for goodness sake Cheer up!!!!!   I know its France and gonna be lots of French people but the majority are just so rude!!!!
We booked this last minute and we absolutely loved it! Great to have some fun before returning home for Christmas
The tickets are sold out. NoWhere had chance to get if someone are traveled feom far far away and spent quite lot for fly/stay etc.
"It really is magical, we had a fantastic time, the park is very busy but why wouldn‚Äôt it be it‚Äôs DisneyLand. You really need premier passes as the wait times were around 60 minutes, with the premier passes we were on most rides in 5-10 minutes at the most. Some people have said you can do it all in a day which is nonsense, we didn‚Äôt do it all in 2 full 10hr days and we never stopped going from ride to ride.Lion King show was amazing, Together Pixar musical adventure with live orchestra needs to be seen to believe how great it was.Pirates of the Caribbean, Buzz lightyear Laser blast, Avengers Web were all super rides as were many others. Parade and drone show was visually spectacular. The only small thing I do believe the park could look at is the price of food, the ticket prices are high for the park already without food costing so much. Overall our family of 4 had an amazing time and hope to return soon."
"Disneyland Paris stands out for its quieter atmosphere compared to other Disney parks, which we appreciated. It is likely the most peaceful among them all, offering a less crowded and more relaxed experience. However, the rides felt less thrilling compared to those in other Disney parks.What significantly detracted from our visit was the prevalence of smoking, including among cast members who smoked in open-air resting areas. This greatly affects visitors seated nearby, who are forced to breathe in secondhand smoke. It is disappointing that Disney has not taken a firmer stance on managing smoking within the park.Considering that the park caters primarily to families and children, this oversight is particularly concerning. Secondhand smoke poses health risks, especially to young children, and goes against the wholesome family environment Disney strives to provide.We strongly urge Disneyland Paris management to address this issue by enforcing stricter smoking policies or relocating designated smoking areas far from where families gather. With so many children around, their health and well-being should be a top priority."
"Quite disappointing after visiting Disneyland in LA.  Too many rides that were just themed roller coasters rather than an experience related to the theme , a good example is the Indiana Jones ride which is a great ride in LA but just a roller coaster in Paris.  The Disney Studios Park was really sparse and not many rides.  One day was more than enough time here."
"Having visited Disneyland Paris back in May my girlfriend and I wanted to experience it at Christmas.This is a once and done for us, too busy, some of the staff quite rude this time and the food was average at best.Firstly the grounds and hotels, always kept clean, tidy, well presented and looking great. Part of the reason for the return was to do some of the rides which were closed on our previous trip and tindinthebOarisnChrietmss Market.Some managed to do all the rides we planned and wanted and they were as good as expected and as we remembered.Webslingers - very entertaining, fun and interactiveFlight Force - Superb, a re-themed rock'n'rollercoaster which never fails to deliveryToy Story Parachute drop - Not bad, good fun and very minimal in the intensity (looks worse than it is)Crushes Coaster - Awesome, very well presented and themed and prob quite high on the intensity for a family coaster, very good rideStar Wars Hyperspace Mountain - superb ride and better than the Florida Space mountain by farBig Thunder Mountain - Amazing, far superior to any other BTM we have ridden at other Disney parks Phantom Manor - I feel this is more true to the movies than the Florida Haunted Mansion and is a very good rideIndiana Jones Cosster - Another great addition which is very well themed and very funPirates of the Caribbean - Great but I cannot decide between this and the Florida one, I think Florida's or better tbh but this has an extra drop which is coolNow the tower of Terror... Wow this never fails to deliver, randomised drip sequences and superb theming this is a classic. We only ride it twice and both at night as it's much better then and its superb, although slightly shorter overall as it doesn't have the building swap like in Florida (this is the same setup as California), this however is imo more intense than Florida's version and is a must ride for anyone.Now the food. This is where Paris fails drastically.Firstly food options lacking, secondly seating, too many inconsiderate people sitting in food location on their phones without food and never ordering any or reserving tables when others need them as they have food. Annoyingly the staff  do nothing about this.When we ordered from Casey's corner we asked for the food in a bag to go, when we collected it was on a tray and when asked for it to be bagged the guy said should have when ordering. I did tell his we did and it was on the receipt if he'd have bothered to read it.Then the snacks, tasteless, bland and sickly at times with only a few exceptions. The Christmas gingerbread Micky was the best, soft, not over powering and very nice.The Chocolate Christmas tree - very nice and better than expected with a nice hint of hazelnut but possibly too much fake vanilla flavouring.The pistachio Boba Fett - Dry, bland, sickly and very disappointing (especially as he is my fav char) Chip and Dale cookie very cool looking but overall disappointing with next to no taste at all.Overall the trip was very good, we liked the decorations ones but it was very overcrowded, many rude people around and that was even more apparent when the parades and evening shows were on as people think it's fine to just push in trying to move you to take the spot you're in, or keep moving in front of you blocking views.Crowd control at Disneyland Paris is appealing and needs a lot of work as it's far less controlled than other Disney parks we have visited."
"I‚Äôm disappointed with Disney Land as We were refused access with no customer service assistance to rectify the situation.We purchased passes for two visits to Disney land, the first pass was excepted and we had a wonderful day in Disney land. The second pass we decided to execute two days later only to be told the tickets were for consecutive days, there was no second date or the word consecutive on the tickets or website, Disney land tried to say its customer error they was unable to prove and when challenged to indicate the documentation information they was unable to produce any tangible documentation evidence but still refused entrance to the park. Customer service is poor at the ticket sales office with little or no help other than pay twice although we had proven a valid ticket or at worst floors between the park and their ticket providers.In my view due to evidence submitted the park should have had a duty of care to ensure the tickets were fit for purpose. In short their customer service was as much help as a hand brake on a canoe.If visiting Disney land please ensure all the dates of your visit are printed on your tickets to avoid disappointment like we endured.Please"
"We visited on 17/18th December and stayed in Santa Fe. After seeing Halloween, I wanted to come back for the Disney Christmas Magic and I really enjoyed it! The decorations were fab and the theming as always was brilliant. Really enjoyed the Christmas parade and the Princesses. Yes it was busy, but we already expected that and we didnt really queue more than 20mins for a ride. Tried some of the themed Christmas snacks, were they amazing? No. But they were enjoyable and on par to expectations. Plenty of characters around to meet. After already going earlier on in the year, we knew what we wanted to do and see so it helped having a plan. Another good visit!"
"While I completely appreciate the fact that this is one of the most popular places to visit... the levels of overcrowding in the park really took away any magic that I was hoping for during my recent visit. I left with genuine safety concerns with the way in which crowds were being managed during particularly busy periods for parades and night-time shows. As someone who often tries to avoid the biggest of the crowds, this was simply impossible to do without PAYING for it. Overall, the park is beautifully presented and all cast members do their best to provide exceptional customer service, but this isn't always the easiest when the stream of customers is endless. There are also some areas that are in desperate need of cleaning and maintenance. I was shocked to see how dirty the dumbo ride was, with many of the effects switched off or rusting. During the visit, there were also some technical issues that were letting the park down. Another area that needs improvement is directional signage. Good luck trying to find your way round if you're not ready to explore and hope for the best that you stumble across something you were looking for. This is particularly true at night where many areas are essentially left in complete darkness due to lights not being on, or turned very low. The characters and interactions, most of the attractions and the overall vibes are still magical - the park is completely let down by the way in which you are basically funnelled into a very crowded central plaza even if you're not wanting to watch the parades. We got stuck at the side, essentially pushed against a railing while cast members told us to 'get off the road' during the parade. We had nowhere to move to and as more people began to push past, it felt really unsafe. There needs to be a specific route set for anyone wishing to bypass this area, and staff need to do better to manage crowds and move people safely rather than just assuming everyone is there for the parade. The same is true at night as the plaza fills up 2 hours before the fireworks start. We arrived in plenty of time, and did not see a single cast member trying to manage the crowds, other than those that were telling us that certain routes had now closed, unless you had paid for the reserved areas. Lack of signage, lack of direction and lack of crowd management took away all the magic I was hoping to feel. It just felt far too busy at all times."
"We usually go to WDW every year but this year opted for Disneyland Paris for the first time.Postives: Only 1 hour to get there... Park is very nice looking... Mine Train, Space mountain and Phantom Manor better than Orlando version...Gifts seem cheaper than OrlandoNegatives: Smokers everywhere, and i mean everywhere. Staff not interested. Not really any Disney magic, more of just another theme park.   Alot smaller and of course, the weather. Homeless beggar on the entrance of the park, and people wandering around the entrance asking to buy your tickets,Overall, I am glad i went so I can say i have been there, but if they had built this park in a better climate ( Spain maybe ) and they were STRICT on the Smokers, it would be a regular place i would go to. ( Our clothes stank of smoke at the end of the day)"
"Please remember our views below are just that, solely mine and my wife's alone. You may go and have the time of your lives and we hope you do. We are just reviewing from our PoV being huge Disney fans (mainly my wife!) and visited both USA and France parks many times now.Lets start with the package booked and hotelWe booked for the 2x of us for a 4x nights / 5x day stay. We stayed at the Sant√© Fe hotel, the cheapest on site budget hotel. We have stayed there before and liked it, it does the job. We planned to go as it was my wife's birthday, for her big one next year we are going back over to WDW Florida, but we felt we needed a quick Disney fix, a Christmas Disney fix this year. We also booked the half board meal plan and photo pass. We done this a good few months ago and pre booked all the restaurants we wanted to eat at etc at the time of booking. Highly recommended you to do this too. You will not get a seat anywhere on the day, so please avoid this disappointment. Now the cost for this 'mini' Disney fix.....just very shy of GBP 2,000 with the half board meal plan, park tickets, photo pass and birthday treat cake for my wife on her birthday. That is not including the LeShuttle train which came in at around GBP 150 -200.00 depending on time of travel, car size etc. Now in comparison, with the WDW Florida holiday we have booked for next year staying at All Star Movies, with meal plan, tickets, premium flights and photo pass included for 14 days it is GBP 7,000, you can see how relatively expensive DLP is and therefore what you would expect and want for the price you are paying. Now don't get us wrong, we will pay the money, but we expect the service and experience, the Disney experienceSo we rock up to the Sant√© Fe around 1400 hrs after good LeShuttle crossing and drive down. A very easy drive to from Calais, its about 3.5 hours. Roads are good, mainly two roads and that's it. It will cost you about 25 Euros in toll but you can use a debit/credit card for this, so don't worry about being cashless. We knew we would likely be too early for the room, but we wanted to get the photo pass voucher from reception so we could get some ride photos that afternoon. If we didn't want the photo pass that afternoon we could have gone straight to the parks (after parking the car at the hotel) and used our magic passes on the DLP App. Everything you booked beforehand and during your stay is kept on the app. I'll digress a little here sorry. The app overall is very good. But it stutters a lot, loses connection to the Wi-Fi and even mobile data if you have that switched on. Always at the most inconvenient time too. Also, so many people through the parks just gawp at their phones whilst walking aimlessly about, its endless dodgems in the park and combine that when its very busy and you will not walk a straight line longer than 20 metres! Oh and also do not expect an apology or excuse me from anyone if they bump you or block you etc. Its a European thing i think, no one cares at all. Just me, me, me. Anyway back to Sant√© Fe. The gent we spoke to at reception, nice guy told us that our room was not ready and that they will text us (checked my number with me) when the room is ready. Gave us a card key and said as soon as you have your text you can go straight there as your key will be activated. Will point out to you now that the key states 'Magic Pass' on it AND the reception guy said we could use this card in conjunction with the app. Handy that then if the app doesn't work at a time when you really need it to. we headed in to the parks. Come 1700 hrs, still no text. So by then after the travel day and the missus getting me on Tower of Terror as our first ride (blooming thing!), we headed back to reception. We saw a different guy this time. Again nice chap. We explained we still hadn't got our room number yet. He looked at his screen and said ''i am sorry your room wont be ready til 11pm'' then he smiled and said only kidding and am sorry that you didn't get your text, lets sort this out for you. My kind of guy with my kind of humour bless him. Now we did request a room on the ground floor close to reception and the La Cantina restaurant. Well they did exactly that for us, ground floor in the Sally building. Bang opposite the restaurant and reception, we even ended up parking the car right next door to the building, literally 20 secs from car to room, brilliant. We gave them our thanks and headed to the room. So Sant√© Fe is Cars themed. Rooms are themed nicely, but once again could do with a new refresh and refurb. Think they were just refurbed or freshened up after our last visit a few years back. But its still very clean and tidy. Room serviced daily too. They even left the trolleys out if you needed to grab some extra towels at anytime. The beds, oh my, they were divine. Some might find them too firm, but we thought they were just right and had good nights sleep even from the first night. The biggest let done of the room, the bathroom. Especially the shower. My word. I could dribble faster, the temperature control is none existent, so be prepared to go from scalding hot to ice cold in a matter of milliseconds. The shower curtain is of the flat variety, so if you are even the slightest bit bigger than an Oom-pah Loompa expect to be fighting a clinging war with the curtain. The plug mechanism didn't work in ours either, at all. I had to dismantle the thing so we could take a shower. The cleaners put it back when they cleaned through that morning, so when i had to dismantle it again the next morning.....we hid it! ;). So yes the rooms could do with a bit of a refresh and certainly a bit of plumbing maintenance. We had breakfast at the hotel each day apart from one day we did the character breakfast in the Plaza Gardens. The hotel breakfasts were fine, usual buffet type, plenty of choice and all fresh. The rolls are very crispy though, so go careful and perhaps avoid if you have a delicate palate or false nashers. We also had dinner in there a few times (on the half board plan). This is where we found issue with the 'Magic Pass' door key. It doesn't do anything but open the door apparently! That's what we were informed getting to the front of the dinner queue to check in. So traipsed back to room (luckily not that far away) to retrieve me phone. I left it behind just that time to have a blooming rest from it you know, thinking, as i was told and as it states on the card 'Magic Pass'. Also another dinner tip. Take some of your own drink with you. You only get one free soda each, once you've drunk that you cant refill it. It uses some fancy chip on the bottom of the mug. So they can use fancy chips on the bottom of the drinks mugs, but cant activate a room key to do anything else than open the door......even though the key says 'Magic Pass' and i was told it was usable for all the other things too. I am not over this yet am i??lolBuses to the park your usual fayre. every 12 or so minutes and its literally a 5 minute journey (if that) to or from the hotel. Expect to be bundled out the way by most as they vie for seats, but don't worry about all that nonsense, as long as you get on it, its only a five minute stand topsSecuritySo you now have to go through security checks before heading to either park. This can get extremely busy. Once again the staff are not very helpful at all.........sorry to say it again, if you speak English, expect more nonsense than other languages might suffer. One time through i was accused of carrying a knife in my bag! I offered to move out the way, over to the usual table where you would empty bag contents and empty my bag for them to search through properly, like a decent and proper security guard team should. Nope they (all 3x of them) continued (and wanted to continue) making a big fuss, holding up the line and machine, still accusing me of carrying a knife, but without actually allowing me to empty my bag to show them otherwise. You know what it was they saw on the x-ray machine? My credit card holder.  Didn't get any form of an apology or thank you have a good day, nothing. Embarrassing. For them not me tbh. Walt Disney Studios Park (the name for now)Basically, its shut! lol. Its not by the way, but it might as well be with the amount of refurb and construction going on. Instead of doing this and that bit by bit as they do in the States, they have decided, in their infinite wisdom here, to rip the whole park apart and refurb it all at once. Maybe a good idea, maybe not? But at present it resembles a building site more than anything else. Still nice and tidy as always. Very crowded though, even more so when you are being bottle necked into walkways surrounded by scrim. So yea its an alright park, that if you wanted to, at the mo you could complete in half a day. Tower of Terror just a classic as well as Ratatouille. One or two new rides in Avengers. The biggest disappointment is the Cars Road Trip ride. Just the Backlot Tour ride with the name Cars Road Trip stuck on the front of it, with blu-tak. Where's the Disney Imagineering with that?? Had the chance to really zazz that ride up. Gone for the idea of the Cars land in California, but no just a name rehash. Very disappointing. Cars not seen as woke enough these days i suppose to grant it any more than a name change rehash. some good food and snack stalls if you can get anywhere near close to any of them. Majority of the restrooms, if not all, extremely clean and tidy. Warning for the ladies though, unfortunately you still may have to queue for yours. Awful really, we put men on the moon almost 60 years ago, but still in 2024 ladies still have to queue for toilet space! Its the same in both parks by the way. Us lads though no problem though, no queues seen at all. Will say to the gents though, again this is for both parks, some of the toilets do not have many cubicles, so if like me you prefer a cubical......whatever your intentions, please be aware of thatMagic Kingdom (Disneyland Park)Looks beautiful in its Christmas fayre and d√©cor, it really does. But it just lacks the magic, the Disney experience, the bubble you know. If you have been to Disney in the states you know what i mean. A few years back when we last visited DLP it started to feel that it had. I think Disney had just come back in to it. They had previously sold their shares in it, for it to dive in to the depths of its despair. Well it seems to be slowly sinking towards that despair again. Ok Disney has always been about the money, BUT it still gave you that escapism, that running from the real horrid world, even just for a few days to escape, go back to that child like state, that comfort that we all love, even if many of us cant or wont admit it. But with DLP that's all it seems to be about. Money, rides and shows and how much they can make for it. Will get on to the Premier Access stuff shortly. But they just don't care for the personable service there they really don't. Its someone's birthday, throw a badge at them (once they have shown the date on their passport of course, can't have anyone walking around in a 50p badge saying its my birthday if its not, crime of the century that. But why not to be honest? They don't do anything special anyway for that person. Each and every staff member at WDW wished me a happy birthday when i was there celebrating, i even got some pixie dust treats. Nowt big, but say place you in the front row on a ride, or a fast pass on a ride to save queuing, but it felt special. When my wife and i had our honeymoon many moons ago in WDW we were given honeymoon badges and was treated like royalty. Everyone stopped to say congrats, we got asked to open the theatre doors to shows, our own ride vehicle on certain rides. It was amazing. DLP, they couldn't give a monkeys at all. Might as well have just stayed at Centre Parks or Alton Towers. No disrespect meant to either of these venues by the way, its just Disney should be different and run properly it is different than the rest. Again back on track, MK was also very clean and tidy. Very crowded. Some would arguably say that DLP may well not have a capacity limit it was that busy. Parade was nice, but very short and the same parade happens twice a day so they can get the floats back to the original position. Again where's the magic in that?? Plenty of room guys, reconstruct your behind the scenes better! Or make it one big parade and ferry the floats back after the park has closed. Still a beautiful looking park i will say that and do like the fact you can walk through and around the castle, room permitting of courseWalt's RestaurantWe booked this experience on our half board meal plan. It was one of the best experiences of my life and the best three course meal i have ever had. We had seats at the window over looking Main Street and we were there to watch the early daylight Christmas parade pass by. One lady that did know the Disney experience was our server a young lady called Clara. She was just the best, a credit to Disneyland Paris. The only downside, was yet again someone else that could not control their children. had one of them leaning across me food at one point! It could not diminish though what a fantastic meal and experience it was. Personally, do not think children under 12 should be allowed in there, there has to be somewhere for us adults just to enjoy the magic in peace, if only for a couple of hours. It is also adult themed in there, nowt to interest the kiddo's, so just give it to us!lol Biggest tip though if you fancy eating there, please book in advance like we did you will not get in on the day, or even trying to book a few days ahead, i think you will be disappointedUltimate Access - Gives you ONE ride on all rides named on the app which is the majority of the rides in both parks. This access is for both parks and has to be used in one day, not over the course of your stay. Its from 90 Euros each (child or adult), but it never is that price. We paid 120 Euros each for ours, 240 Euros total. We did it on the Friday as we thought being a weekday would be slightly quieterOne Access - Basically you can pay for this for one particular ride at a time on the day you are in the park. Prices from 5 Euros each a ride (child or adult).... yea right!Ultimate Access Experience (UA)Ok then. Take a free to use Fast Pass system used many years ago up until very recently and successfully. Now take that service, give it a fancy name at each ride 'Premier Access' charge people even more than a daily park ticket to be able to get on the rides quicker without queueing or a very short queue at most. Shall we let them have unlimited rides for that money?  No. Ok then shall we redesign the old Fast Pass queue layout so we can get the Premier Access customers to the start of the ride quicker? No. So then what we are saying here is we are going to use a once free service, that worked and make no changes to the queue layout and charge high end fees to place people half way down a queue, still to wait 20 plus minutes? Yep, that'll do!Now please don't get me wrong here, i know its an add on, not a compulsory service and you pay your money you make the choice. But if you are not going to improve the once free Fast Pass service at all, then don't charge the money you are charging. Some people like us, many if not all people are only at DLP for a few days and some would like to try and get on all the rides that they can and are willing to pay for that service. But don't rip people off and that's why it is a rip off. An answer to this would be for the UA to last for the duration of your stay, that would be more fair and look affordable. I mean even though there is only technically one and a half parks open at this time due to the refurb works, i challenge anyone to get all the available rides on the UA done within the day. It would be nigh on impossible. Some of the PA lanes at some rides where as long as the normal lines itself, Thunder Mountain springs to mind thereOne Access (OA)The following day we thought we might try this on a coupe of rides we didn't get to go on yet (yep even after a day of PA at 120 nicker each!) At 'from' 5 Euros a ride it didn't seem too bad.......ok. So cheapest ride was Phantom Manor at 7 Euros. Ok not too bad we thought. Only for it to breakdown literally as we were about to go through the door. You can wait and use the OA on the ride later when its fixed, but fixing time not guaranteed. So you could go use it on any other ride ''Any other ride'' as muted by the queue attendant at PM. Well Thunder Mountain be the closest one we will try there. But then told by the TM queue attendant, ''no the ride you go on must be an equivalent OA price as the one that broke down'' fair enough we thought but looking through the list we didn't really want to go on any of them. So we thought as we are here at TM and the actual queue time stated 65 mins (it never is that time by the way, here in Paris they seem to be longer than stated, total opposite to WDW which always seem to be less, strange) we thought lets book a OA pass for TM whilst we are here, on we go to the app, TM 16 Euros EACH!! 16 Euros!! I just laughed, i had nothing else left. So in conclusion are the UA and OA worth it? UA - well all depends if you've got the fitness (and inclination) to do two parks all in one hit in the one day, how many rides you really want to get done and of course the crowding of the parks and not wanting to see any shows or parades. OA - Avoid like the plague, unless you are really really desperate to ride a two minute ride, still queue for likely 20 plus minutes at least and loose upwards of 30 Euros, more if you are a family that want to ride, remember the price is EACH, man, woman, child or beast!Genie and Genie Plus crashed and burned in the States when people said enough was enough, i can see this happening with both the UA and OA too unless the pricing is drastically overhauled, or the Premier Access queue line lanes are redesigned Character Breakfast - Plaza GardensGreat experience. Our characters were Donald, Daisy, Goofy, Pluto, Tigger and Eeyore. They were all very attentive and great interacting with us all. Had time for everyone and hung around for the whole hour. Breakfast buffet was good too as expected with the usual food on offerBirthday cake treatThis was ordered when we booked the break back in the summer of this year. each time we booked in for dinner we were asked if we wanted the treat. No not this time thanks we are waiting for the actual day. Then the night we wanted it the system at the restaurant went haywire and showed we hadn't ordered it. I then tried to show the details on the app, but yep you guessed it, the app wouldn't work due to connection issues. Manager called in to try and sort it, the English language seemed to become more and more difficult, funny how it was all going smoothly until a glitch in the works. 20 minutes later with my wife getting more embarrassed and upset by the minute i just asked to forget the birthday cake we will just get it refunded after our stay. even then i still had to show the Magic Pass on my app that still wouldn't connect up. Had to wander down the corridor until it fired up again. All quite embarrassing and unnecessary. But at the end of all that, no apology, no thank you for our patience and please have a happy birthday, absolute jot all. In conclusion i am really sorry in saying that, I do not think it will ever change at DLP to be a consistent great addition to the the Disney world of parks. It looks great yes but lacks any substance whatsoever, apart from the odd event or staff member. But it just not do enough i am truly sorry to say. Save your money, head to Florida or LA instead. It was certainly our last visit to DLP"
"Sorry to say but for me disney did not live up to the hype.  Way too many people allowed in, making queues for food and rides ridiculous,  even with early access with magic pass. Food was ridiculously priced and poor quality. The rainforest cafe all the food was served cold. The food from the bakery was stale. The only semi decent food was in the Stark restaurant and even that wasn't great.  Shops all sold the same things and the selection inside was very limited. Hardly any characters wandering about. We did a character breakfast and they characters would disappear if you didn't get your camera out fast enough meaning we hardly got any photos with them , it was all very rushed. Although the food was OK. Main street was beautiful,  lovely decorations and very christmasy,  but no Christmas anywhere else in either parks. I was expecting more themeing around the park, but there was hardly any and it just felt like any other theme park, not the magical once in a lifetime disney experience people rave about. The parade was fantastic tho, really good ( get a spot near its a small world, it's was less crowded that end!). Didn't see the fireworks as they don't start until 10pm and my kids were exhausted by then. The rides are OK, but nothing amazing,  no better than a fairground in some instances, and some are just plain odd ( snow white!). The shows are very good but extremely loud. We stayed in the hotel ( done a separate review) for 3 nights and had 3 days in the parks. Lots of people seemingly more interested in getting a photo of themselves than enjoying the rides! And so crowded as to make the whole thing unenjoyable.  Toilets were clean and plentiful at least. Staff very efficient but not friendly really. It certainly wasn't magical and I wouldn't go back. But my kids did have a good time so there's that. Unless your a total disney nut I wouldn't bother!"
"Disneyland Paris was pure magic! The mix of Disney charm and European style made it so unique. The castle was stunning, and the rides were just as fun as in the U.S. parks. The parades and shows were amazing too. It‚Äôs a dream come true for any Disney fan!"
"We stayed at The DP Hotel this December for 3 nights and had a great experience. The staff were friendly and very helpful, the room was clean and neat, and as it is open 24 hours we could come and go as we pleased. Highly recommended by us."
"Always the best place on earth! Performance was great, food options was great. Had lots of fun there with the family. Will be back"
"A fun set of parks to visit. First foreign Disney park and decidedly different from the US versions. While smaller than the Florida parks, there was still plenty to do. December has the Christmas theming, with most characters in their Christmas outfits. Lines were not too long, but having the extra magic hour before park opening when you stay on Disney property makes it easy to ride the popular rides first."
"Great to visit anytime,We found the train the best way to visit,Two parks two days seems the right amount of time,Lines can be long on some rides,Recommend going short line rides a few times than wasting a hour for one.Firework display at night  brillant"
"I celebrated my birthday at Disneyland Paris, and it was an unforgettable experience! I enjoyed the rides, especially the Finding Nemo roller coaster, which was a thrilling adventure. Although Disneyland can be a bit pricey, the overall experience was worth it. One downside was the long wait times to take pictures with Mickey and the Disney princesses, which were around 2 hours due to the crowds. However, the night show made up for it, with an incredible display of music and lights that truly captured the magic of Disney. Overall, it was a fantastic birthday celebration filled with fun and excitement!"
"Awful. Been 3 hours and not been on a ride. Queues massive and not suitable for young children who need toilets and are cold. Overrated,over priced and far too busy, 50 minute queues everywhere.  More entertainment in a shopping mall with free entry. Caught fleeting glimpse of one character who ran away .,.no fun at all. Total waste of time and money. Rip off"
"Pros- park looks fab, really well designed and decorated Rides really goodParade really goodCharacters really great with children Cons- a huge issue is the amount of people smoking , there are smoking zones but people smoke all over and the staff do nothing The amount of work going on, major construction site at Disney village and at the studios is disappointing, really ruins the magic, they should do one at a time, there was also numerous barriers up in the park"
"We had the best time at DisneyLand. The parades, the rides, the characters, everything was awesome and my 6 year old niece loved it.They were also really accommodating to disabilities which made the day so much easier."
"This trip was really good, I was really surprised about the connection in the park and the service points, it worked really well. the rides and food was also really good and i loved the variety of rides."
"Disneyland Paris was pure magic! The castles and streets felt like a fairy tale, and the rides were bellissimo‚ÄîSpace Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean were my favorites. The food was delicious, though I did miss a proper espresso! The parades and shows were incredible, and the whole place was so well-organized. Perfect for Disney lovers or anyone wanting to feel like a kid again. Fantastico!"
We've waited all year to experience this holiday. And taking my young 3 children on they're very first trip abroad. We are staying in the Newport bay club and staff in the hotel have been lovely. Room is lovely and clean plenty of space etc. Bit of a que for some rides but that's fine and was expected. My issue is if you are coming here with young children don't expect some of the security guards to be helpful. I've had the most awful experience tonight and the attitude and professionalism of the 2 security guards I had the pleasure of bumping into has left me so angry. Infuriated and sent me absolutely crazy. We had left the park after a fabulous fireworks display myself 3 children (one in a pram) amd the rest of my family. It was heaving took us a while to exit. Myself and the baby in the pram got stuck in the crowd and my other 2 went ahead of me. I was stuck in the line as we all were like a heard of cows and I accidentally turned at the wrong exit quickly realised what I did at the gate and turned around quickly to catch up with my other 2 children who are 7 and 8. I was stopped by 2 security men who started shouting at ne that I'd have to leave and go in a direction I was unfamiliar with. I explained I needed to get my children and pointed at where they were heading which was just past Annette's dinner they said I had to go that way. I again told them my children are potentially on they're own I need to go to them they told me tough and that they didn't care and were pointing at where I should go. I got so anxious and upsett by this point I was trying to phone my other family members but couldn't get through I then started shouting out of fear they were so horrible and nasty. The whole thing was totally unbelievable. There I am standing there telling them my 2 young children are potentially on they're own and 2 security guards who are payed to assist and take care of paying customers of the park just didn't give a s##t.  I don't know how many times I tried to explain what had happened but they wouldn't listen.. I had no choice in the end but to scream the place down and only then they allowed me to go in  after causing such a scene. I got through to my dad eventually and thankfully told me my other 2 children were with my mum. My dad came down to meet me because I was so in shock and upset. He went to ask the 2 security guards for badge numbers one was very confrontational with him and pushed his upper body into him to show his badge. Got back to the hotel to make a complaint and found out they had lied to cover they're tracks and said I was trying to enter the disney village when that wasn't really the case so just shows they didn't listen to a word I said. Absolutely disgusting behaviour from 2 individuals who's duty of care basically is there to protect the guests but they couldn't give 2 hoots that a 7 and 8 year old could have been wondering the place on they're own. Them laughing at me when I was clearly upset says it all.
"Avoid this park. Prices are disgusting. Costing nearly 3pound for a bottle of coke also 16pound for a burger meal. The airport staff fobbed us off every chance they got and directed us to the wrong places resulting in us missing our train, which may I add are not as priced as online but 4 to 5 euros more. Costing us double for another ticket. We were given a room that was currently being occupied,walking in on another guest in there own room. And then the cost of snacks and merchandise etc which nothing was under 4 euros you can easily spend a couple of grand here if you are a family of four, Its all a big money grabbing scam. The happiest place on earth ,yeah If your financially able to or it ruins everything"
"Disappointed by the lack of festive decorations and also by the number of rides and areas closed due to renovations. Appreciate work needs to be done but you buy your full price tickets and don‚Äôt get full use. Main Disney park had more open than the Hollywood Studio park! Stayed at Sequoia lodge got a nice view, rough loo roll and rough paper thin towels. Supplied with lamp, coffee machine and kettle with only one plug socket."
Rides breaking down left and right Rudest staff ever. Overpriced and poor quality of souvenirs/clothes. Fix the problems or lower the prices.
"Spent a full day, well 5 hours navigating the many different rides and attractions, lots of things to see and do, maybe more lights and night, some places difficult to see, plenty of places to eat, toilets when you could find them, signs would help, but we still had a good time, cold and damp weather didn‚Äôt stop us and waiting time for rides was fine, us adults loved it!!!"
"Worst Disneyland so far (I‚Äôve been to the parks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and California). We left this place devastated and frustrated from our experience. We were treated so badly because we were Malaysian Indians and didn‚Äôt look French of course . Most of the staffs were rude to us (especially Casey‚Äôs corner, the waiter was Indian and assumed we were from India, started arguing with us, pushed us back ) . Some kind of racism going on around here . Some rides had technical issues while riding it. Kept stopping and restarting back. Rests of the guests were also rude to us, one man pushed us and his lady showed the middle finger to us. We were shocked to see this kind of attitude. There was also a point when a mother quickly pulled her child away when she passed by us. It‚Äôs not like we were gonna kidnap her child! The worst part was when we returned to the train station to board the train back to our hotel, we were targets of a pickpocket attempt at Marne La Vall√©e Chessy station. The pickpocket took my mom‚Äôs purse and to her dismay there was no cash/credit card inside (we have kept it elsewhere) , so the pickpocket threw away the purse and left the train. Honestly, we didn‚Äôt feel safe at all. Not even at Disneyland. We will not be returning to Paris ever. No one treats us well , always rude to us, and has some kind of stereotype about Indians. It was a mistake thinking Paris Disneyland would be a happy place! Regret our decision visiting this place filled with racism."
"Disneyland Paris is a nice place with good rides and fun parks with nice themes, and best of all the two parks are next to each other. But you mostly get good service if you speak french. They‚Äôre horrible at english - even though Disneyland Paris has existed since 1992. Everything is mostly in french (rides, shows and signs) and their merchandise is in french. There is no guest service in the park like in all parks in Disney World, so you‚Äôre on your own most of the time."
"I would strongly recommend a visit at Christmastime.  Despite it being colder, it was totally worth it and we just wrapped up.  Don't miss the shows, they are incredible!"
Absolutely shocking. Nothing there is edible service is terrible. The restaurant staff are dam rude. No Supermarch√©s in the resort or surrounding areas unless you drive so forced to pay extortionate prices for garbage microwave food. Just go your local theme park and save your money. Plus it‚Äôs that busy your like sheep in a pen
Loved it! So did my kids! Rides were very fun but food wasn‚Äôt very good. I think they could‚Äôve put the lands in better areas as it felt like stuff was randomly next to eachother.
"Good but if you‚Äôve done or planning to do America Disney‚Ä¶ save your money for that! Needs more rides, not as big as advertised and lots or regenerations happening currently. Was half term when we went so busy as you‚Äôd expect but queue jumping not worth the cost imo.Enjoyed the drone display but fireworks were poor.Shops and food expensive but the food was good! Everything comfortably done in 3 days."
Definitely need to check this Disneyland out- we had just a one day ticket luckily the snow had settled but it was still cold and luckily not as crowded as I know Disneyland can be. Different experience with cold and snow but the highlight was the Ratatouille ride-meal and the associated food chalets with cheesy food if we hadn‚Äôt booked for dinner I would have definitely eaten there. the lion king show was really good singing and dancing and acrobatic acts.It was great to tick this  Disneyland off our list not one of the bigger ones but still worth seeing.
"We stayed on site for 3 nights & easily got everything done. Mid week in December. One night was very foggy and you couldn‚Äôt see the drone show and they cancelled the fireworks.The fast pass was very expensive, over ‚Ç¨20 per person on some rides. So we didn‚Äôt buy it. We didn‚Äôt do drop drop, but these are the rides to head to if you do. Or wait until late when the fireworks are about to start. Our longest queue of just over an hour was Peter Pan & Crush Coaster. Both good rides. Our must do was to buy a plastic keepsake glass of champagne. ‚Ç¨20 each, but lovely. Only buy on food cart at end of Main Street outside Gibson Girl. I did get to keep a cork too.Favourite ride is Thunder Mountain. Better and faster than Florida. We did it after dark and the lighting make it even more thrilling. Indiana Jones is a quick moving queue & the upside down loop wasn‚Äôt that bad.Everyday at least 1 main ride broke down. Space Mountain & Pinocchio were. Loved for refurb. There is lots of disruption due to building works. Food and alcohol is very expensive everywhere.Lots of shops with same stuff. We found the jewellery quite reasonably priced. I agree with an earlier review, too much LILO & Stitch stuff. The park was crowded and the parade route is short. Very good light parade. There was something in the afternoon but it wasn‚Äôt listed on the App? We just bumped into it at the main entrance. Mickey, Minnie & Santa at the station & Goofy & dancers in street. This was 2.30pm.The drone show is good but could be better. The fireworks are really sad compared to Florida and the music was unmemorable. A lot of stuff is in French. Star Tours was in French. Why can‚Äôt they also have rides in English like they do with some of the shows.The park & the hotels are all looking very tired. Dull paint work and scruffy pavements. Not magical at all. We  love Christmas, but felt there should have been more decorations in Studios and Disney village. I think the parks must look really sad when not decorated. Most of the queuing areas are outside. So you are out in the cold or heat, also not shade if it rains or is really sunny."
"Me and my partner came here for 5 nights and stayed in the Newport bay hotel this hotel was lovely the room was Clean and big, we had a few issues with the bath not really holding the water properly and house keeping not changing the bed unless reminded too but we quickly got this sorted by speaking to reception, the park it‚Äôs self was good aswell lots of shops for all the merch we found different things in the shops so not all the same stuff everywhere the only slight issue we had was the food quality obviously we know this is a Disney theme park and the food wouldn‚Äôt be cheap but that wasn‚Äôt the issue the quality was not great in cowboy cook out and pym kitchen, however Walt‚Äôs, plaza gardens and remys were great overall the park was busy however does get quieter in the mornings and evenings"
"I visited Disneyland Paris in December with my partner and two year old son. I have been to Paris a handful of times but i have been lucky enough to also experience Disney World in Florida. Disneyland is split into two parks -:Disneyland which is the equivalent to Magic Kingdom and is basically the same as the US one and the other park, which is next door, is Walt Disney Studios, similar to Disney MGM studios in Florida but smaller..This review is merely about Disneyland. Firstly, i stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and although expensive it was really worth the money due to the ease of access with it directly next to the entrance to the park. I prefer visiting Disneyland at Christmas time due to the generic atmosphere and the Christmas Spirit, from walking down Main Street seeing the snow falling down to the christmas parades that take place. Each morning at opening Mickey and Minnie stand on the balcony looking down at the guests and waving and we noticed this was every morning which was nice for the little ones. I will break the review down into the main Pro‚Äôs and cons -:Pro‚Äôs - The Atmosphere throughout the park, especially at Christmas, is amazing and well presented with the Christmas tree and decorations and the spirit of Christmas throughout the entire park from the music to the various different stalls and drinks servers scattered around. I often forgot about the struggles of life whilst enjoying myself throughout the park. The staff were friendly and accommodating and there were many about. I don‚Äôt think i had any staff member who was rude or gave a negative attitude and many were forthcoming to help you where needed.The shops were not too badly priced for presents such as toys and the prices i paid is something i would expect to pay even if back in England. I did think it would be considerably more considering where we were but it wasn‚Äôt too bad.Cons-:There is literally shops everywhere selling the same stuff, i think this could be cut down and maybe consider more rides or activities instead of the constant shop after shop.Ensure you get to the fireworks early (from 9pm i would reserve) as this can get very very busy with crowds and you often find yourself being pushed or barged. Also check the weather as we watched the fireworks/laser show when fog set in and the castle could not be seen at all to which most people left. This will save a wasted trip, also if there is wind or any sign of bad weather the drones will not be flown which can affect the electric show. Speaking of the electric show i wasn‚Äôt really fond of it and i personally feel it is not Disney enough, if that makes sense.Where are all the characters hiding? We literally saw the same characters in the same place every day such as Winnie the Pooh at the entrance, Balou by Adventure Land however there was no Mary Poppins, Buzz Lightyear or any other main character at all however i personally saw Chip and Dale so many times but i don‚Äôt think i even knew who they were until someone told me. I think times have changed now where children watch more modern disney programmes/movies so therefore more options would be better character wise rather than the same ones.Very busy which causes the queue times to be very long. Fastpass is also around ¬£9 per ride which you can only use once, the ‚Äúunlimited fastpass‚Äù also only allows you to go onto a ride only once and cannot be used numerous times so be careful of that. i love Christmas at Disney and as much as i have mentioned the cons i still cannot get over the happiness on my childs face when he see‚Äôs woody or the lights and for that i will continue to come each year however i think people need to realise that this is Disney, it is a business which is famous worldwide so therefore they need to expect some of the prices to be higher than expected."
"This was our 15th visit to Disneyland Paris and we've been really impressed. We decided to stay at the Disneyland Hotel to enjoy a special experience, and I've reviewed this separately.Disneyland Park itself is beautiful as always. Christmas decorations this year are even more magical than ever, plenty of colour and the periodic Main Street USA events are great to experience. I'd definitely say to everyone that you must visit Disneyland Paris just for how beautiful the park is and exhilarating the attractions are, while providing a wide variety of intensities around different theming to suit all individuals unlike no other theme park I've visited can.Food has massively improved across the park. We visited Walt's - an American Restaurant, Captain Jack's Restaurant des Pirates and a few fast food restaurants within the park. Food is now high-quality, flavourful and consistent across all the outlets we visited while actually being a reasonable price to what I'm used to in the UK (3 course fine dining meal is approximately 55 euros). Service in restaurants was good in some and inconsistent in others, but still the magic atmosphere remains.Disney Illuminations are spectacular and I'm hoping the new version coming next year lives up to expectations! The Magical Sky Parade was a lovely addition too. However, I was slightly disappointed that the VIP viewing area was quite large and unavailable for purchase during my visit despite staying at the Disneyland Hotel, meaning members of our party got quite tight into a zone with plenty of VIP space next to it just to get a good view while Disney Cast Members attempted to strictly enforce the no-entry rule which didn't really compliment the experience and would make some uncomfortable.Merchandise has also improved since our last visit, I'm pleased they have gone back to varied merchandise throughout different stores which makes shopping more exciting. Christmas merchandise was more restricted but I appreciate the beautiful designs, more baubles like usual please!Service has got slightly better but significantly better on attractions, queues being much more organised and controlled. Premier Access is still quite expensive but worth it.I was hesitating whether to add a 4 or 5 star rating, however, I decided on 5 due to the massive improvements and our families' desire to return very soon. I'd highly recommend to everyone and thank Disneyland Paris for making these valid improvements which fans have suggested!"
"People say Disney is meant to be ‚ÄòThe happiest place in earth‚Äô but sadly that wasn‚Äôt my experience.  The facilities at the park were great and the food and drinks, and as expensive as to be expected. The shows are also great, and the rides are fun. Sadly the aggressive nature of a lot of the other guests really spoils it. We took my MiL who is in a wheel chair, and honestly so many times she was banged into and pushed about as people rushed to get in front of her, particularly on the buses between the parks and the hotels. We missed several buses that we could have taken purely because of this. The attitude of others really ruined the experience for me and my family. I also thought the merchandise went really heavy on Lilo and Stitch at the expense of some older but brilliant characters missing"
"Having visited disneyland paris 5 times in the past we couldn't wait to return, although it had been 15 years since our last visit, we still had many magical memories from previous visits but what a disappointment it was when we got there!The park is now 30 years old and it's clearly showing its age, from broken pavements to 90% of the rides breaking down, etc.  They clearly need to spend money on fixing this park and not spending money on the new frozen park which is certainly not going to improve things.The waiting ques are atrocious, we were waiting about an hour for each ride, we don't remember it ever being this bad, then they want 16 euro to skip the que for peter pan, this is just ridiculous!Almost 90% of the rides we went on broke down, including thr rail road train and crushes coaster, which was the only one who gave us a fast pass as an apology!Some rides have changed and not for the better, such as the cars road trip which is just awful now, it was better before!The shops sell the same old merch as each other, you used to get different stuff in each shop/different parts of the park and the prices are ludicrous ¬£8 for a plastic pen, come on?!There was a lot of meet and greets with characters, which was definitely an improvement from previous visits and the disney app had its advantages, although it wasn't the most accurate and really needs updated, such as the list of places you can use your food pass at and upto date menus.We bought a food pass which was definitely worth the money as the prices were just shocking for what you actually got especially at our previous favourite, Annette's diner which was absolutely disgusting.The park has definitely changed in regards to health and safety, with seatbelts on many rides such as the carousel and other rides but these seatbelts hardly fit adults (I'm only a size 12 and I'm struggled, the staff waste time checking everyone's seatbelt and giving out extensions surely they could put an announcement out and make all seatbelts longer to save time and cut down ques?I lost count of how many times I tripped and witnessed people tripping up over the kerbs and broken pavements, this is definitely an issue that needs addressed and as for cleanliness, there was rubbish everywhere, visitors don't seem to care!The weather was cold and icy when we visted but yet not a bit of grit in sight, which made the paths so slippery.The parades have definitely improved from what I remember from previous visits and was definitely worth seeing and the illuminations were really good, probably the best thing we experienced.The security has been increased with  lots of security checks, such as bag searches, sniffer dogs, police, etc which isn't a bad thing!I could go on but there is many things that need to be addressed at disneyland, as I doubt we wouldn't return anytime soon.The magic definitely isn't there anymore and many things need fixed to bring the magic back."
"We found this visit really disappointing unfortunately, for a number of reasons.1. There were NO photo pass photographers anywhere! Isn‚Äôt that part of the experience? In LA they‚Äôre everywhere. 2. The characters were few and far between, and you had to queue for ages to meet them/get a photo etc. In LA they‚Äôre everywhere.3. Limited options for food without making a reservation. I understand amazing places book up months ahead but everywhere else seemed to close up early so if you were at the park late you had really limited options. 4. Nobody seemed to know where I could buy stamps to post the postcards I purchased from Disneyland. I was sent on a wild goose chase! Hot top if anyone else needs them - I had to go to the booth where they rent out prams to get them in the end ? 5. I have a small baby and I‚Äôm breastfeeding. It‚Äôs also freezing cold because it‚Äôs winter. There was nowhere I could find to sit down indoors to feed my baby. Apparently there is one room available for this somewhere, but I couldn‚Äôt find it. I went into a cafe to ask if I could sit down - the lady snapped at me telling me I could only sit down if I bought food. That was fine, but my baby was screaming. She could see we were both distressed. Then while my husband went to get our lunch, I asked a man who was seating people if I could sit down to feed my baby while my husband got our lunch. He told me off like I was a child and pointed to a sign that said you can‚Äôt sit until you‚Äôve bought food. It was absolutely humiliating. I get it, there‚Äôs rules, but in a place like Disney that‚Äôs supposed to be family friendly, it really didn‚Äôt feel it. 6. In the same restaurant, we observed an older gentleman in a wheelchair being wheeled out by his son. TWO waitstaff stood doing nothing and watched them struggle to get through the door! In the end another patron stood up from her meal to get the door for them. 7. Not a huge deal but those iconic badges that say if it‚Äôs your first visit, your birthday, etc were nowhere to be found. Apparently it‚Äôs something only hotel guests get? Not sure if it‚Äôs just in Paris or everywhere but disappointing all the same. In LA they were so kind and helpful. In Paris they just didn‚Äôt seem to care. They‚Äôve lost the ethos of what Disney is about. Very disappointing"
A lovely day out with.interesting place for children‚Äôs.Quite expensive but every penny worth for sure.will be back again
"3 weeks after my trip and I still have the Disney blues! I have wanted to go all my life and it did not disappoint, DLP is an AMAZING place! Everything from the theming of the hotels, restaurants and shops to the rides and characters was perfect! We visited during Christmas so it was incredible to see all the Christmas decorations, the drone show and the Christmas parade. It jump started our festive season and felt like magic. Obviously it is not cheap to go, or when you‚Äôre there, but it is Disneyland and is to be expected. We fell very lucky with the weather which made the whole trip even more enjoyable. The app was great too and really helped us organise our day and overall trip. I loved everything about it and can‚Äôt wait to go again one day!"
Really great time. Weather was snowing for the first day but cleared after that. Atmosphere was wonderful. Some areas were closed for refurbishment but it didn‚Äôt kill the atmosphere. We stayed in Newport Bay Hotel. Really recommend going at Christmas
"Overpriced, crowded, lack of information. Had to pay extra for anything good and most of rides were not available. Took my son for his birthday and he was very disappointed. Was a lot of money to spend on a very bad experience. Would nit recommend"
"First thing to make clear: Disneyland Paris is 2 connected parks, Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park. We only did the Disneyland Park. Visited on a hot summer day in July. As we rented a house in Esbly we were only 8 minutes away. We arrived before 10.00 and passing security and the entrance went smoothly. Then the wait started. You can see in the app and per attraction what the waiting time is. 1 - 2 hours of waiting is no exception. The park is nice and the attractions are great but waiting 2 hours for a 2 minute ride is not funny. We were with teenagers and focused on the rollercoasters but also did 'it's a small world', Alice's Curious Labyrinth, Autopia and the railroad. It was nice to sit for a while in a cool place during Mickey‚Äôs PhilharMagic. We have seen and experienced it and we don't think about it to come back. The hot temperature and long waiting lines aren't worth it. The price (we paid almost USD 80 per person with a Family and Friends ticket) is also not attractive to try it another time. Restaurants, food stands, and souvenir shops are also extremely expensive, but they think they can justify it because it's Disney. The crew we interacted with is also not friendly and looks stressed but what you imagine with these big crowds? When we wanted to fill our water bottles (they have some water fountains) a lady started shouting to us because it was the area for the disabled people to watch the parade. Way too much stress. We have seen it, it was a nice experience, but the long lines, high price and stressed crew doesn't attract us to come back."
"This is my 5th visit since 2017 and sad to say it's lost the appeal and magic it used to have. I usually receive an email from Disney asking for feedback but it's been a week since I've been back and got nothing. That says a lot!The cost cutting is evident in the parks, closing earlier than last year, the parks open at 9:30am but some rides don't open untill 11.00am this is what pissed me off the most.If the parks open it should all be operational!The Christmas decorations are the same year in year out, this year tho some cheap red ribbons tied around some lampposts and fake poinsettias in hanging baskets. Once you leave main street and venture into the parks you'd forget it was christmas. The castle twinkling lights on the turrets weren't turned on and never saw the advertised Christmas drone show at all it was the normal Disney electrical sky parade.Walls (not a typo) Disney studios is a mess, an absolute mess. To be charged full price to enter that park is a joke. A one ride frozen land won't fix this either.It's split down the middle with one walk way to get to either side of the ""park"" so rammed with people. The avengers campus toilet's are bad, and others dotted around the parks, no hot water,some taps not working,hand dryers not working and no paper to dry your hands. Lovely.Food and drink are extortionate and honestly not worth it for such basic food.Smoking/vaping and smoking cannabis is an issue in the parks and village.The lion king rhythm of the pride lands is amazing! Cast and crew well done! Can't recommend a visit and have not been with when friends ask how it went. Save ya hard earned money and go on a beach holiday all inclusive for 10 nights for what these conmen charge."
"What I didn't liked and few improvements suggestions:- Frozen themed events and attractions were missing. - Long waiting queues (particularly for meeting the characters and for the shows). - Very expensive souvenirs. - When is a bit windy the night show is not using the drones which makes the show a lot less spectacular... - The restaurants in the parks are closed in the evening 9most of them after 16:00) making it impossible to have dinner at a decent hour and then see the night shows (after the show is over - 22:00 is to late to grab dinner outside Disneyland Park because everything is closed so you end up starving in the night).- After the night show the park is closing immediately so everybody is leaving the park at the same time making it very hard to get home with that huge crowd heading to the same busses/metro/shuttle stations.- more surprise appearances of characters would be great. we only met Captain Hook. Maybe princesses (especially since for Princess Pavilion you have to wait so long in line and then meet whatever comes your way), fairies, no Frozen characters or shows available- some sort of virtual queues would be nice"
"Three days at Disneyland Paris with the family. The park was good, but some things worth mentioning for future travelers. It was cold. And the cold, in my opinion, is an obstacle to enjoying the park fully, since you have to wear several layers of clothes, every once in a while look for a Disney store or restaurant to enter and warm up a bit, and if it rains (as it did one day) then it is really challenging - I was with both my grandsons, 8 months old and 3 yrs old - since you need to cover them up and try to keep them dry. Next time I would certainly opt for a warmer season, even facing more visitors. Another cold factor was the ""cold"" reception by some of the staff there at Disneyland Paris. My French is OK, but my English much better. When asking to switch  to English there was a clear change in the attitude o some Disney personnel I came in contact with, at the kiosks especially. It looked like many of them were stressed out (my impression). It also seems that they reserve the low winter season to revamp the park, so many you see many closed maintenance areas. Needless to say that food and drinks in general there are very expensive, but that is a given. My 3 yr old still enjoyed every minute, so Disneyland is surely worth it, but I would recommend going in a warmer month."
A strange Disney Park I normally go to the Florida one but fancied a mini disney break. Good stuff*Disney Staff were great...*Thunder mountain is better than the florida one.* The train station is literally at the door* Magic Kingdom is impressiveBad Stuff* Hollystudios is more like a building site at the moment.* Disney Village is rubbish compared to Disney springs and the redevelopment plans look rubbish too.*Indiana Jones ride is dreadful and its really a cheap funfair ride thats had theming slapped onto it.*French people - They have a cultural habit of walking straight at you and expect YOU to move. I got fed up of moving out of their way so one attempted to push me in the middle of main street (think about the space they could have used)*RUBBISH WIFI - sorry Disney I can't pay for stuff online like fast track if your wifi is rubbish.
"‚ÄúMagical experience! Disneyland Paris is a dream come true with its enchanting atmosphere, thrilling rides, and incredible shows. The park is beautifully themed, and the attention to detail is unmatched. Perfect for families and Disney fans of all ages. Highly recommend!‚Äù"
"This was my second trip of 2024 and it was just as magical as the first! My dad came with us this time for his first Disney Parks Holiday and he is already wanting to plan the next one!We saw Disney in the snow which was wonderful, however I did get soaked and cold because we were not anticipating this so I would personally pack waterproof shoes and lots of layers because you can take layers off if you get too hot!I would say it was lacking in the merch department but that could also be because I have been to Florida twice and I was spoilt for choice there! The prices were reasonable though for most things and I just adore my new Disneyland Paris Fantasia Spirit Jersey!Overall, it was the most magical way to start this festive season and I look forward to planning another trip soon!"
"Although I'm not such a big Disney fan compared to when I was younger, I visited Disneyland Paris alongside my brother in September as he really wanted to see this. It is only the second Disneyland park I've visited as I went to the Orlando one many years ago. And I can say that it was pretty good, with various attractions from different Disney Films, including both Pixar and films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe/MCU (the latter of which was quite nice as I've recently started watching some MCU films). I also enjoyed watching the Disney parade with different Disney characters in the evening. There were also different eating areas present and the food I ate in the Stark Tower inside the MCU area was relatively good. Another thing I liked was that this place is easily accessible by public transport with an RER train line connecting the area directly with Central Paris (very convenient for us and I can say most of the other Disneyland Parks in the USA definitely need to take note from this), and it is also possible to get there by bus, taxi and high speed rail, not to mention it is also possible to get there by driving - although if you're a tourist, I strongly recommend getting there by public transport.The only things I didn't like were that the admissions prices were quite expensive (although it was worth it just for seeing this area) and the website was a bit misleading as the website stated that tickets should be bought online and wasn't clear enough that you could purchase tickets directly from there (I'm glad we could still buy tickets there as we otherwise wouldn't have been able to see this place). I would also advise anyone going there to go there early in the day (or if possible visit it in the span of two days) as since the park is so large, it can be difficult to see most of the rides - I only managed to get on one or two rides as there wasn't enough time. But apart from those, I did enjoy my time in Disneyland Paris a lot despite only spending a day there."
AMAZINGFriendly and fun.Very cold xnd can't do it all in one day.Staff and entertainment made up for the dismal weather.Only down side was the length of time waiting in ques.  Otherwise brilliant Time
"The park is good. There are some very strong attractions like Avengers or Finding Nemo, personally it made me sick because of the twists and turns it takes."
"A bit of Disney magic, character meets, amazing rides, the animation academy, the snacks! Even if it's just once - treat yourself!"
The attention and quality that we are use to from Disney in the states continues in Paris. Genius to have a metro station next to the park. Great experience. We went through both parks in 1 day (start with Hollywood studios).  I‚Äôd recommend the express pass. It‚Äôs a lot but well worth it.
"We had a fabulous time at Disneyland Paris recently.  Flew to Paris then took the fast train straight to the Disneyland station, well worth doing the train as it only takes 10 mins though it was full and we had to stand.  Had a half day in Universal park then a full day and a half in the Disneyland park.  Went on lots of rides though had to queue for most of them but expected that.  The parade was amazing and the lights on the castle at night were fantastic.  An absolutely fab time was had by all and will def go again."
"We came to Disney for my girlfriend‚Äôs 30th for a single day. We travelled from the UK to be there. It snowed and almost all the rides were shut. One of the ones we went to broke down after a 30 minute wait. This was at the end of the day so it would have been our last ride. They gave 0 compensation‚Ä¶ not even a key chain which felt very stingey. So basically no rides, bad over priced food and no fireworks which is why we actually came to Disneyland"
"Hello, my trip to Disneyland Paris was a horrible experience.  Due to heavy snow and bad weather, 95% of attraction rides were closed . Definitely need a refund! We took our vacations just for this occasion to spend a wonderful and everlasting experience. And we had none of that.Please contact me on my refund .Best Regards Angelica Rodriguez."
"Where to begin... Maud in the restaurant near Star Wars needs a serious attitude adjustment, Other staff disinterested, talking amongst themselves and some glued to mobile phones while managing queues... Many of the rides are closed and there's building work right in the main area where you enter and leave the park... IMHO, having been to Orlando 3 times and here once, I'd never visit Paris again... Just poor in general."
"I wouldnt go again to be honest. The food was terrible, I dont mind paying over priced for decent food but Mc donalds food was better than the two restaurants we went to in the park. The que for chip and dale was 1.5 hours long with them having 3 'mini breaks'. The rides were never less than 30minutes mostly 45-1 hour. Not a lot of character viewing and all were spread so far apart making it nearly impossible to get to all. I think the buzz lightyear ride broke down not sure if it was part of the ride but it certainly diddnt make the ride any better. Lots of agro between people at firework and parade time, mostly adults arguing and pushing, one lady pushed my 9 year old to get more to the front feel this needs better arranging. The hotel offered 'free coffee' 2 free a day but when we finally found the machine you couldnt fit our standard size mugs in them. You have to pay extra to visit mikey. The 're fillable' drinks means going and paying for another drink with the same cup, you have a qr code that only allows one use. We paid for the lion king show and was 1 minute late and not allowed in, it diddnt state you needed to be half an hour early like the lady told us when she refused us entrance."
"We celebrated our wedding anniversary at Disneyland Paris, and it was absolutely magical! The park was beautifully decorated, and the atmosphere was full of joy and excitement.We loved the parades, meeting the Disney characters, and enjoying all the fun rides. The fireworks at night were the perfect way to end our special day‚Äîthey were breathtaking!We also had a lovely surprise waiting for us at our hotel room, which made our celebration even more memorable. The little touches made us feel so special!Disneyland Paris made our anniversary so memorable, and it‚Äôs a place we‚Äôll always cherish. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
"Couldn't believe the good value I got the park tickets for,half the price of the tickets on Disney website! Highly recommend"
"Another flawless visit to Disneyland. Having been to Disneyland in California and Japan, this visit to Paris Disneyland was as good or better. The ease of access to Disneyland from the Paris Metro is second to none. The park met all expectations, clean, friendly staff and amenities, great rides and lots to see and do."
"We had such a magical time with our 4 year old. You see a lot of grumbling and complaining in reviews but an unbiased view is just go to have a good time and immerse yourself in it. Plenty of characters to meet, rides were decent, shows were good but some were amazing such as lion king and the magical mickey one. Parades all awesome and firework show spectacular. We did lunch with the princesses which was brilliant, also reserved standing for the fireworks which felt worth the money. We found 99% of the staff were super friendly and helped to make the experience."
"This was my first time to experience Christmas at Disneyland Paris and have to say it was very magical.  The whole atmosphere was superb, the decorations were first class  I will definitely return again on future"
"Great first visit to Disney Paris‚Ä¶friendly staff, great atmosphere and a wonderfully clean park. The christmas lights and parade were amazing. Brilliant fun for the kids.Queues can be long but its expected. Highly recommend a visit"
"Too busy, overrated and overpriced. Once you've taken into account the rip off prices for literally everything, you can go to much better theme parks for half the price (eg Efteling). Considering the profile of this brand there are also surprisingly few serious rides here. Needs serious investment and new rides rather than just sticking a new theme on old rides. Studios is currently a dump... Just a giant building site. Two rides I was on today broke down while I was in the Q. Ride times generally long because they are letting too many people into the park. Overall. Very poor. You have been warned"
"If you want big mouths from park employees and improper treatment, this park is the place to be, otherwise don't go there"
Me and family went to Disney land in March and it was amazing the rides were great not as long as a queue as I had thought universal Studios were really nice  we all enjoyed it but then we went over to Disney land and had the time of our lives the music was phenomenal and so was the food definitely gonna come again!
"Poor experience at Disney Park with family. Major issues: inaccurate map directions, extremely long wait times (80+ min for Mickey) with no seating, and lack of staff assistance for directions. Restaurant had no Disney characters as promised. Stroller rental was overpriced. Couldn't enjoy many attractions due to exhaustion and poor navigation. Overall, basic amenities were overpriced and the park failed to deliver the promised magical experience for young children"
"Uphill struggle at Big Thunder Mountain! Mountain malfunctions in the middle of the big thunder mountain experience. I travelled day and night, over sea, queued for a lifetime to go on big thunder mountain. How would you feel if you waited forever to do something and it smacked you in the face. At full speed, as fast as a cheetah, the ride came to a sudden jolt. Smack. ""Staff will be with you shortly to help you off the ride,"" said the announcement.   We walked down Mount Everest to get back to land.All was not lost though as we went on it multiple times and it was exhilarating! We also had a thrilling time on Tower of Terror, Hyperspace Mountain, Peter pan's flight and Crush's Coaster.I recommend bringing your own food, as its very expensive for small amounts. Be kind to your wallet."
Where have all the characters gone?!? We saw 2 characters around the park through a whole weekend here. Nothing like it used to be
"Loved it, a bit too long walk to parks from hotel but it is fine. Amazing rollercoasters and attractions , my favorite was toer of terror or something like that.  Workers really bring that disney magic vibe.  Everywhere is super clean, gardens beautiful. I have so many good pictures and feelings from that place. I highly recommend, but make sure to choose right time to come as some attractions can be under maintance. I have been there 2 times from another country."
"As a family, we went to Disneyland for 4 days, which was great. The only downside, the toilets wasn't kept clean, and when you have young ones, it wasn't great as the staff didnt keep on top of it with checks."
"Ticket worked fine, we were able to skip the line, and go right in. Disneyland Paris is much smaller than Disney in Florida, but it was a nice day. Fun to say I‚Äôve been to Disney Paris too!"
"We visited last weekend in October and the parks were at full capacity! It was very busy, que for the toilets, que for a drink/snacks, que for lunch, que for rides etc. we did manage to get quite alot of rides in though surprisingly, the app helps telling you the ride queue times so you can plan the day better. We have been before so we knew what to expect and we had a plan of which rides we wanted to go on. My son is just 1.2m tall so we were able to go on some really big rides and his first upside down rollercoaster (avengers). We had a great weekend, the drone and fireworks show is very impressive.Next time we will come mid week though and avoid the weekends.The halloween decorations aren't anything special so not really worth coming in october just for this."
"I've been coming to Disneyland Paris for the last 20 years, but this is the first time I've felt that the Disney magic was missing. There are lots of renovations and new building works going on particularly at Disney Studios. The background noise of diggers and hoarding erected everywhere were intrusive and made the area feel even more crowded. We visited during the week after half term, and it was crazy busy. It feels that there is no control over visitor numbers, and this has resulted in ridiculously long waits on all rides. Not sure if I am likely to return any time soon."
"Staff are rude and arrogant.We expected it to be expensive, but they really take advantage of parents in a parasitic way. Hong Kong one was better despite being smaller, the staff have a huge impact on the experience - well not be returning any time soon. The children enjoyed themselves, but they're quite easily entertained luckily."
"Wow, where do you start. Firstly I went to Disneyland Paris 20 years ago and had a fantastic time so I was looking forward to sharing this place with my family. I booked the family of four tickets and arrived at 10:00. We had the app and booked lunch at 12:00. We decided to go to Big Thunder Mountain as the app said it was a 55 minute wait. We got to the line at 10:50 and finished the ride at 12:40! Almost two hours and missed our lunch. We ended up buying four pretty average burritos and four drinks for ‚Ç¨75 and set out again. In the eight hours we were at the park we 6 hours were spent in queues. We managed 5 rides in that whole time. Even buying a hot chocolate took half an hour and so we just gave up around 18;00. Unless you are willing to spend big on queue jumping passes (which I morally object to) you need the patience of a saint to come to Disneyland Paris. The magic has drained out of this place which is unbelievably sad"
"A fantastic trip to Disney with my family, shame the Disney magic isn‚Äôt present in the Disneyland hotel my daughter has autism and was collecting the stickers at the hotel etc and went in to see the princesses at the hotel so asked at reception who gave her one then at the concierge who just said your not a resident show me your magic pass if your not you carnt have one !!! Wow were is the magic in that hotel !!! Left my daughter really upset after the interaction !!!"
Not to bad....apart from the time in the Qs waiting...if it says 35 mins it's usually over a hour etc etc!!!Still a good experience though ..good luck for the future
"As expected, all of the parades, lights shows and most of the rides are great. What is poor is the interaction in the park. We'd been telling our little girl to expect to meet all her favourite characters but over 2 full days in the park we only saw the D list characters Pluto, Tigger and Jafar (all in photo areas with long lines).We booked a character breakfast so thought that would improve matters but instead we got Pinocchio, Gepeto, Captain Hook, Smee and Eeyore. Not a single child new who Gepeto and Smee were. For the obscene amount of money this place rakes in, surely they could afford to populate it with some Mickeys, Minnie's, Princesses or the parks unofficial mascot Stitch who is just everywhere.We stayed in Sequoia Lodge and for the price, you'd expect luxury but all meals are extra cost (25 euros for a buffet breakfast, 45 for evening meal) and the only luxury was a kettle and coffee machine (but no mini fridge for milk and the like)"
"Disneyland Paris delivers exactly what you would expect: a magical and fun-filled destination packed with music, entertainment, thrilling rides, and shops brimming with Disney-themed treasures. The park offers so much to see and do, all while being impeccably maintained to the highest standard. Adding to the experience are the friendly and helpful staff who go out of their way to ensure that guests have a memorable time.One of the downsides, however, comes not from the park itself but from some of the visitors. The sheer number of guests with camera phones can be overwhelming, especially those who seem to be there solely for photo opportunities. It‚Äôs not uncommon to see people changing into various outfits and posing with props, which can make popular spots like the iconic castle more crowded than usual.That said, if you can manage to look past these camera-focused visitors and enjoy the park on your own terms, the experience remains highly enjoyable. The key to having a great time at Disneyland Paris is to embrace the crowds and plan accordingly. Yes, it‚Äôs busy‚Äîbut that‚Äôs to be expected. By using the official Disneyland app to track ride times and plan your day, you can maximize your experience and cover more ground. The app is an invaluable tool for navigating the park efficiently.One visit to Disneyland Paris is best spread over several days to truly take in all the attractions and entertainment it offers. And be prepared for lots of walking; it‚Äôs a sprawling space that will have you getting in plenty of steps by the end of your stay.In summary, Disneyland Paris is a vibrant, well-maintained theme park full of fun and wonder. While the crowds and camera-centric visitors can be a slight drawback, the overall magic of the park more than makes up for it. With a little planning and patience, it‚Äôs an experience that‚Äôs definitely worth it."
"Had such a wonderful Halloween trip to Disneyland Paris.  Stayed in the beautiful Newport Bay Hotel in a Compass Club room.  The hotel and the staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble.  They made the whole stay fun and really engaged with our granddaughter.  The staff made sure that we had everything we needed for a perfect stay.  The park looked beautiful with the Halloween decorations and the 'villains' who were located at various areas of the park were great fun.  The rides, although busy, were worth the wait.  There was a good range of food and drink available around both parks and the parades and shows were very enjoyable.  Our granddaughter visited the princess pavilion and also had a princess breakfast which she absolutely loved.  We were also lucky enough to get the Royal Dream for her and she was treated like a princess from start to finish!  This was certainly a holiday she won't forget!Although the Studios park is under renovation at present, there was a good range of rides and the shows available were excellent.  There were also Marvel characters roaming around the area so we had good interactions there too.We would definitely visit again at Halloween - or any other time of the year in all honesty!!"
"We visited Disneyland Paris over the Halloween period, and it is definitely a must. The Halloween decorations was amazing and everywhere tou looked, you knew it was Halloween. The shows were very good and I would highly recommend them. We had 3 and a half days at the parcs, and we managed to do most of the rides and 3 shows. The children loved Micky mouse and Mini and all the other characters. we managed to get 11 signatures and pictures of a few more. Would highly advise the breakfast with the characters if you can afford it, if not, don't worry, you can see most of them around the parc but you will have to que anything from 10 - 30 minutes all times are on the app and locations.The disney app is very good and accurate on waiting times. Most of the time, one day it was a bit off but you can look for yourself.We managed to do all of the things we wanted to do in the 3 and a half days and I will tell you now you need your walking boots we covered 75000 steps in the time we where there.There are plenty of toilets on the site and very well located.There are water dispensers in many locations so to save money we used water bottles and used squash to top it up and add flavour. We had the small squeeze bottles that give you about 20 fills.The place is amazing as with everywhere similar the cost of drink and food is a bit pricey but the place is magical and make the most of it."
"It is 1 million % worst it to visit. We ourselves were in 2 minds because the kids are close to teens and we thought kids might not be interested. But wow, forget the kids, we ourselves as adult enjoyed it so much that can't describe it.all ages of people come there and have so much for all to have fun. It is an experience of life time. We as adults go back to our childhood. So many rides and waiting time is not much on a weekday. I mean 15 to 25 minutes but chit chatting, taking pictures, munching few stuff, the time passes and then when you go through that experience then you realise it was worth the wait. Amazing amazing amazing experience and one must go to Disneyland if in Paris.both the parks can be done easily in one day, no need to buy 2 day pass."
"The park is in need of renovation. In general you will experience long queues for fairly old rides, poor theming of areas and overpriced food options. The Star Wars area has particularly bad theming."
Excellent hospitable staff members who helped me with tickets üéü as I missed my dates  and were kind enough to swap the dates.
"An amazing 4 day trip with family and greater family. The parades were brilliant, shows we worth the early que and wait. recommend the lion king and mickey apprentice, but legroom was too restricted for me and i had to leave. planning your timings for rides was the best thing. early pass allowed us to focus on the big rides and the disneyland app allowed us to see the real time wait times and move on to other rides. Thunder mountain went down several times, but being flexible was the best route. Allow for wet weather gear in the spring and whilst others were hiding we hit big rides with no wait times at all. we loved every minute, the kids went on almost every ride. if you don't like heights avoid tower rides but there is plenty to go and see. at 6ft 3 i could fit in every ride. tight on a couple but i was never unable to go on. walking across the park soon racks up walking distances. so good shoes are a must. Early passes in and staying late allowed us all to get extra rides. Can't wait to go back"
"It‚Äôs a Disney park, so we all know what to expect. The rides were decent, albeit short. The character meets were wonderful. Plenty of access to food, drink and toilets. The parades were excellent as was the light and fireworks show at the end of the day. Staff throughout were brilliant and helpful.Now, onto some more negative thoughts.We stayed at the on-site Newport Bay Hotel which is a 10 minute walk to the park gates. This is mostly pleasant, alongside the lake which has Santa Fe and The Marvel hotels on it too. However, once past the lake you get rudely ushered through a tent with paramilitary-looking security people to scan/x-ray everything. I understand that security is important but surely there is a way of making this more in keeping with the Disney theme and less oppressive? Maybe dressed as Storm Troopers or something? Then through the Disney village into another ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù before finally being able to get through the park gates themselves.After dark the park is very dark, the lighting isn‚Äôt great. Golden Hour with the hotels is pretty much useless as the vast majority of rides are closed. It also seems that no one queues, personal space is a problem, and no one smokes quite like the French. Despite signage, the park is full of people walking round smoking and vaping."
"Worths going. Children are happy, adults too. Long waiting times but with the right companion it feels almost acceptable."
"I Went with my granddaughter and we had so much fun! We took the metro from Paris, which took us straight to EuroDisney!  It was a fun experience that I highly recommend!"
"The parades, shows and evening light/ firework shows are amazing. My one suggestion is do NOT bother doing the princess meet and greet! Queued for 2 hours, nothing to entertain children during this time, moved a metre every 20mins, for my two daughters to get 3minutes with Mulan! üôà"
"If I had visited before going to Disney, florida I think I would have enjoyed myself but nothing can compare to floridas disney"
Staff in the park were rude and aggressive towards my children and argued with myself over things that were avoidable
"Hugely overcrowded with massive queues for most rides (1 hour plus for 5 minute ride), made worse by those paying even more than most to jump the queue. Rides themselves were good once on. Parades were great. Light show great, fireworks  very late for children and seemed poor compared to 30 years ago when we last went. Few staff around the park to ask for directions. Accept that we went at peak time  but still far too many tickets sold for the capacity of the park. Rides frequently broke down, though mended quickly.  Many rides did not start till 9.30  so an early entry ticket at 8.30 did not help. the shows in the Studios  the highlight of the trip"
"Great day with the grandchildren 10and 12 so they could go on all the rides,  had fast tract tickets which were very expensive but saved queuing."
"Fantastic experience for our grandson, very stressfull for the adults with the amount of people, however, for all the faults from an adults point of view the happiness it gives the youngsters makes it all worthwhile, topped off with a fantastic end of evening show that is worth the wait, food seems expensive but not that much more than family meal out in the UK, just happens to be every niight"
"everything was magical, especially Mickey Mouse. we had a great time at the hotel we chose. we never could have imagined that a hotel stay can have such pack in such a magical experience!"
"All tickets on the Disney Website were sold out- thanks, TripAdvisor, for the same day tickets for the normal price!! We had a blast."
Very disappointed with how jame packed the park was. There was clearly no regard for reasonable capacity in this park. I've been to disney in California and it was way better. There are no timed tickets at this park so forget about being able to go on all the rides. We were there from 9:30-7:30 and were able to go on 6 rides and see 1 princess. The cue for the princess was 1.5 hours and you don't even get to know whay princess it is. Spent less than 5mins with her. Do not go for one day unless you pay the crazy fee for the skip the line pass. The rich get rewarded here.
"An excellent family experience spent over three days in the park. A truly unique place, offering a wide range of activities and attractions.On the first day, we mostly didn‚Äôt use Premier Access for the rides. Queuing wasn‚Äôt too bad, but most waits were around 40 minutes, so we managed about one ride per hour. On the second day, we made extensive use of Premier Access, which made for a much more enjoyable day as we were able to experience everything. While it‚Äôs very expensive, purchasing individual access for rides turned out to be much cheaper than a general day pass. We used our final day to catch a couple of shows, both of which were brilliant.While the park certainly aims to maximise spending, it offers an experience unlike any other theme park. We found many of the rides to be quite unique‚Äînot only Disney-themed but also mechanically different. There‚Äôs a great use of cinematic effects on many attractions.We first visited when our children were 4 and 2, and nine years later we enjoyed a very different visit‚Äîmore rides, fewer princesses. The park caters brilliantly for all ages."
3 Days at Disneyland were perfect. Magic all over. The weather was fantastic and so all the waiting in lines was fine. We actually did the 90% of the activities in the 2 parks. If you have a good program and use the app will be very easy to not just wait in long lines for hours. All the rides where fantastic and full of excitement and thrill. Already planning on coming back in 2026 for the Frozen Park. Thank you Disneyland Paris for the incredible memories.
"After having problems with tickets two years ago, we stupidly gave this place a second chance. We entered the Studio park unaware we could only visit one. Big mistake as most of it was boarded up, so a complete waste of time. Then after lunch went to other park and refused entry. So ¬£240 to walk around a building site - disgusting NEVER AGAIN avoid at all costs ALSO rip off prices, extortionate"
"My partner, brother in law, 2 nieces and myself went to Disneyland for the first time and boy was it busy. Most rides took at least 40 minutes to qu√© up for, pirates of the Caribbean and phantom manor. Big thunder mountain took over an hour to qu√© up for (it was a good ride which is why this is a 2/5 rather than a 1. 2 small pizzas cost ‚Ç¨40. A bottle of coke ‚Ç¨4.50. Lunch for 5 people where we had burritos cost over ‚Ç¨80. A bubble blower cost ‚Ç¨30!! That was the most overrated priced thing we bought. The staging of Disneyland is nice and seeing characters dressed up makes slightly special moments but overall for the price you pay to go to Disney to just stand in ques it's not truly worth it. I'm unlikely to go back."
"Went to celebrate my daughters 30 th birthday whilst we stopped in Paris for a few days. To be honest wasn‚Äôt particularly looking forward to it but she wanted to go , so we did . We had the 2 park Pass and got on 5 rides in the time we were there. Never queued for more than 45 mins apart from the photos with Chip and Dale . We ate in the park and found the food good quality and very reasonable price wise .  Being October the park  was decked out for Halloween making it a little more special, giving you lots more photo opportunities.  The 5.00 pm parade was very entertaining being Halloween based , with the drone show adding a brilliant end to the day . These parks really bring out the child in you and we want to go again next time we are in Paris ."
It‚Äôs just a seriously overpriced shopping and food mall with a few rides ‚Äòthrown in‚Äô that you may well have to wait an hour and a half to get into!
"Overrated, very crowded, and very limited rides. Except for the experience and ambiance, the rides are very average. If you think it will be like Orlando, you will be disappointed.The drone show and the fireworks were amazing; but it is very late in the night and if you are dependent on public transportation, it is risky to reach back."
me and my family were totally satisfied and surely visit next timeeverything was completely professional
"We visited Disneyland September, now I must admit it has never been a dream of mine to go here, but I am now converted.Booking was super easy, I booked about 6 months in advance and it allows you to make part payments.Arriving at the park by Eurostar train is super easy and then you just hop on a convenient bus to your hotel.Managing everything via the app is super easy and a must. The park is spectacular with so many things to see, do and eat.The staff are absolutely fantastic."
"This was my 3rd time. Last time 2015, we were able to enter both Disneyland park and Disneyland Studio in 1 ticket. We got to watch many shows and enjoy fast passes. The parades were long and beautiful. Now we can only enter 1 park with 1 ticket. Shows were with additional charge and you have to buy the ticket for Disneystudios. Forget fast pass unless you pay extra for ""Premier Access."" We waited 1.15 hrs for 1 minute of Peterpan ride. This might be the last time I wasted my money here at Disneyland Paris. The good old Disney days are gone."
"Second time returning to Eurodisney. We stayed in an apartment close to Eurodisney this time, rather than a Disney hotel as we wanted to get away and experience serris also. We travelled on the buses to and from the park. It was as usual very crowded and long queues during the daytime but when we returned for the evening it wasn't so crowded. The castles were lit up beautifully.  The daytime parade was spectacular. The illuminations and fireworks brilliant! Be prepared to be exhausted!"
"I have no words, a perfect animation for children, adults, all ages. You live a fairy tale, everything is colorful and very special."
Had two great days and really enjoyed it. The only thing is the waiting time for a ride. We spent 2 hours in line just for one ride and on average 50 minute for some of the attractions üëé. The parades are great but have to stand a least 30 minutes before and then you get someone pushing and standing in front of youüëé. The night display with lights is awesome and well worth the waiting completing with a firework di8üëåüëç‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ the best part.
We had a fantastic family experience.I would recommend if possible to stay all day.This means that as the evening draws in queuing for rides is much reduced.The parades are excellent creating a wonderful atmosphere and although waiting time can be long the rides are great fun and enjoyable.Fab  time and happy memories.
"We spent the October School week at Disneyland Paris and stayed in the Cheyenne Hotel. There were 9 of us  and we were allocated 3 rooms next to each other, very close to the path that leads to the parks. The hotel was great. Staff were friendly and couldn't do enough for you. The rooms were large comfortable and cleaned every day. Before going I applied for a disabled Priority Pass and spoke to the concierge on my arrival at the hotel. After I presented the written evidence of my disability I was given the pass. This was a perfect for my trip. I was allowed to avoid the queues and could take up to 4 of my family with me. The staff in the parks were also brilliant and very helpful. Before going on this trip I was worried about how I would manage and with the pass and the help of my family and staff it was brilliant. We ate in several  places in the 2 parks and also in the Village as well as the Buffet at the hotel one evening. I cannot fault any of the places we ate at. The food was good, plentiful and freshly cooked and the staff were were always pleasant and helpful. My grandkids loved it, I am 70 and I loved it and can't wait to go back."
"Overall, a very enjoyable stay.We are a family of four; with a 2 year old and 9 year old.We found the theme park to be really well presented with all of the Disney magic you could expect.The park was busy, but not too busy.We managed to get on most of the rides that we wanted to, and the rides with larger queues we waited until post 7pm, and then it was pretty early to get on.The electric show was great, so were the shows.What‚Äôs stopped the 5 stars, is the amount of people smoking, having visited the Orlando parks, I didn‚Äôt even realise Disney allowed smoking.Minor issues are people pushing in the queues, and there seemed to be phases during the day when quite a few rides were broken down.Overall, highly recommend"
"Disney just cancelled without any reason our reservation for Plaza Garden. I hear they did that for more people. We‚Äôre staying in one of the hotels (the most expensive), booked for multiple nights, no point in calling because they can‚Äôt do anything. So yeah overpriced and underdelivered, it‚Äôs that we have kids who are really looking forward to this."
Had a perfect first visit to Disneyland Paris for our daughter‚Äôs fifth and eleventh birthdays this Halloween.
I think if you are going to promote protecting the planet you need to significantly reduce the plastic from your merchandise.
Had a lpvely visit but not quiet disabled friendly. They allow way to many im so very overcrowded and after the lumination show ots very dark an not enough lighting to make way out the park. The kerbs are not highlighted so not easy to manoeuvre about
Lots to like about Disneyland and lots everyone will already know and love. Well worth it for the experience it leaves on your children. Yes it‚Äôs expensive and yes it‚Äôs a massive corporation but hence it is what it is.
"Easy way of booking, trouble free. Directed linked to the park app. Hassle free. Great option overall, would do it again."
"AMAZING experience. I‚Äôve been to Disneyland Paris (then called EuroDisney) 30 years ago and now we came back to celebrate my son‚Äôs 13th birthday. The kids (13, 9, 9 and 8 months) had SO much fun with all the rides, shows and parades! A definite must"
"Amazing experience, a must come place!However!!! Be aware of the employee Leane from the Dumbo Elephant carousel attraction. She was aggressively screaming at people, and considering the fact that there are mostly families with kids, it was completely unprofessional and created an unpleasant and unwelcoming atmosphere. A large group of people, my family included, was standing in the wrong waiting line because the guiding signs were obstructed from the view, so Leanne started screaming loudly with her high pinching voice that we must leave immediately because we don‚Äôt have any right to be in the priority line. When I tried to explain to her that the signs were not clear, and we were standing there already for 10 minutes waiting, she raised her voice even louder and aggressively kept pointing to the exit, so I grabbed my kids and rushed out just for them not to get scared of her behavior. We laughed at the situation, but it was a very strange feeling inside of me that something might be psychologically wrong with this employee.  Hoping to never see her again, we had to start over in another waiting line, because my kids really wanted to fly at the Dumbo Elephant. When our turn came 40 minutes later, Leanne was there again‚Ä¶ She was yelling again because she needed me to move in order to find a smaller group of people, but behind her yelling I misunderstood and I thought that she was telling us to hurry, so she yelled to my face that I can‚Äôt cross the turnstile and I have to wait where she points to. At this point I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore and I asked her to please speak respectfully without yelling, I mentioned that it‚Äôs the second time she‚Äôs unnecessary rude and that she creates a horrible atmosphere for the families and little kids especially. I had to say it loud because she kept yelling, and people around started to nod and say things how unprofessional and aggressive this girl is. When Leanne was yelling back to me, I just asked her to call the manager because it was truly unacceptable. Leanne‚Äôs excuse was that she has earphones in her ears so she‚Äôs forced to scream. But other employees at this attraction also had earphones, however they were nice and welcoming, and we felt their respectful attitude towards us and other guests. The manager apologized for Leanne‚Äôs behavior and this situation in general, but he insisted that she is a very good worker. I asked him to check the cameras, if there are any, and to judge the situation himself. I was very disappointed with this experience and I wished my kids didn‚Äôt have to encounter such a rude incompetent attendant who creates an aggressive atmosphere in the kids environment. I hope someone from the Dumbo Elephant carousel attraction will read my feedback and take into consideration."
"Revisited here after first visiting back in 1996. It's a good idea to download the Disney app as it gives you the times of parades, shows and queueing times of the attractions but found the app was a bit useless unless you had WiFi access. We visited here on a Monday outside the main school holidays but found it still to be as busy as if it were the peak times.The park is beautifully maintained as you'd expect from Disney but there are a number of building works going on and some of the rides were closed. There's still plenty of stuff for all ages to do and there were shows and parades which we missed because we wasted so much time queueing. Most of the rides were great with some quirky rides too and a few white knuckle ones which'll please the older kids.The highlight for me was the fantastic fireworks and drone show at the end of the night. We had to stand at the back of main street much of the area is closed off 30 minutes before the display starts. We spent almost 12 hours in the park walking just shy of 10 miles and were totally shattered by the end of the day. I would like to go back again in the future but my advice is give it a few years when Disney finish doing all of the building works.A tiring day, but great fun."
"Overall:The trip had some extremely magical moments thanks to the hotel, the characters and some extras we got staying here. I booked directly through the Disneyland Paris website and it was a simple process and there were a number of options for paying. The Studios park, despite the ongoing works was great fun, and I‚Äôm excited to visit here in the future but the Disneyland park was a bit of a let down. The magic has seriously been lost in this park, between people queue jumping (I don‚Äôt mean priority pass but literally grown adults hoping barriers), shoving small children to the ground and miserable cast members, the experience didn‚Äôt live up to expectations (I‚Äôll explain more below). Overall however we had a great few days and we‚Äôre already planning our next Disney adventure (possibly a UK cruise ü§û). Day 1 - Travel and Hotel:I ordered the express luggage service through Disney which meant we could head straight to the park on arrival and do some attractions before our hotel was ready. I would recommend this for anyone who thinking of booking it. We met Darth Vader (shout out to cast member Fredric managing the queue here who was wonderful), and did a few extra . Great start to the trip! We headed over to our hotel, Hotel New York - Art of Marvel which is simply wonderful, from the artwork to the interior design, we loved the experience. That evening we had dinner in the Manhattan with wine included for me, which I thoroughly enjoyed, followed by drinks at the skyline bar and a trip to the kids club to draw some superhero‚Äôs. We loved the whole superhero‚Äôs in the city vibe everywhere in the hotel. Day 2 - Hotel Extras and Studios Park:The morning at the hotel we had breakfast delivered to our room, which came to ‚Ç¨24 for two of us so we could eat and get ready for the day at the same time. I wish in hindsight we did this more or got a meal plan because breakfast options aren‚Äôt great (or much cheeper) in the village. Our morning was taken up exploring the hotel and meeting Captain America at the superhero station before we headed off to the pool for a dip. The pool was warm, Jacuzzi was really nice and the sauna was lovely to relax. Only downside here is the depth of the pool which isn‚Äôt great if you‚Äôre not a strong swimmer (like me). My son loved it however because he can tread water, but there‚Äôs lots of floatation toys and free armbands if your little ones aren‚Äôt swimmers.  By midday we were strolling over to studios park and using the app to plan stops we managed all the ‚Äúbig rides‚Äù and the Pixar Show. A tip for Crush is to wait until the end of the day when people are heading over to the main park for the fireworks. We joined the queue at 7:30pm and were able to ride and still have time for another go of ratatouille before closing at 8pm. We loved the Studio park despite the work ongoing, the different worlds are beautifully designed here and can‚Äôt wait to see frozen / lion king. For dinner we ate at PYMs which is perfect for families and a big winner for any marvel fans, with lots of options for fussy eaters.Day 3 - Disneyland Park:We decided to grab something on the way to the park for breakfast and stopped at Starbucks which is fine but it lacked that magic we had in the hotel breakfast. It also came to ‚Ç¨18 so wasn‚Äôt a massive saving. As it was Halloween season the park was decorated but Frontierland was amazing. Probably our favourite area of the park. Fantasyland was looking very rundown and in desperate need of a paint and discoveryland is a bit off with the mix of Star Wars, Buzz and the Jules Verne vibe, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs been thrown together rather than thought out. Maybe it‚Äôll get updated after studios. Again I used the app as much as possible to do the rides, Peter Pan wasn‚Äôt open for magic hour so missed out here. I would recommend anyone thinking of it, just buy a priority pass for this ride, we queued for 1.5 hours. The app said 50 minutes but I don‚Äôt think it accounted for the number of people queue jumping. It seems in this park particularly the etiquette is that one member of the group will wait in line while others go about the park and come back to join the queue with the person waiting. Frustrating but not really Disney‚Äôs fault. All other rides we queued 5-20 minutes for because I used the app, which I think is pretty good and managed to get done everything we wanted including doing Pirates and Phantom Mannor twice. We skipped dinner today and instead wanted to try lots of the Halloween/Disney snacks but this was very hit or miss. Churos, burritos and a batwing doughnut in Frontierland were nice and suited the theming. The corn dog and popcorn from fantasyland was our favourite. Cafe Hyperion where they sell the Micky Halloween burger was atrocious. We waited 20 minutes to get served, the poor guy at the till kept getting up and going to the counter because the server couldn‚Äôt work fast enough for the orders coming though so he was trying to chip in and catch up the orders. When we did get our food and went to find a seat one cast member shouted at me for trying to sit at a 4 seat table when there were only two of us. She made us get up and follow her around the restaurant looking for a two seater table. People were looking and it felt very uncomfortable being paraded around when there was a number of empty tables. She then had to make us up a 2 seater space near the exit ramp which was even worse because prams and wheelchair users were blocked but she told us to sit and eat very abruptly. I just wanted to get out of there so badly so we quickly ate the burgers and left. There was no drone show on the evening which I expected because there had been poor weather all week and we didn‚Äôt see much of the fireworks either. The one thing that topped me over the edge in this park was a grown man pushing my son to the floor where he was seriously hurt, he is still bruised from how hard he was pushed and a number of people were annoyed along with me and were telling this man to apologies but he simply shrugged his shoulders and went about filming the fireworks. Cast members used to be dotted along main street and would stop pushing and shoving but this has died off which is a shame. I would recommend anyone with children try and buy a priority pass simply from a safety perspective. Day 4 - Last Day / Check out:We got up early and headed to the parks for a few last rides, as well as a trip to the dragon and meeting with Maleficent before heading back to the hotel at 10am. When we got back the hotel staff were already in the middle of changing the room so we had to get our cases and sort ourselves in the corridor. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for me because we were leaving but if people are waiting until the 11am check out this might be slightly annoying.All in all we really enjoyed, the hotel and extras were outstanding and anyone planning to stay at the hotel you will have an amazing time."
"Omg it‚Äôs amazing stuff childhood dreams are made of and you definitely won‚Äôt want to come home , from the minute you enter it‚Äôs wonderful for children and adults we got a 3 day ticket but next time will do 5 days as there is so much to see and do the rides the shows the parades are outstanding , every single detail is magical , I would suggest and hope everyone visits at least once in there lifetime , believe me you will return"
"Visited for the 1st time, two adults & two teenage boys.  We arrived half an hour before the park opened & got to the front of the ques for it opening. We went at it all day only stopping for food & left at the fireworks at the end. We managed to see all the parades, do most of the rides & attractions apart from a few small ones.  I have been to Florida & yes, as a comparison this doesn't have all the attractions Florida does, but it's pretty much the same as the Magic Kingdom! Remember it's not 'Disneyworld', it's 'Disneyland'. It's a brilliant day out, has something for everyone & is still a great Disney park! Wear comfy trainers, get a good sleep the night before & be prepared to be tired out if you're going to try get round everything in one day!"
"Just returned from our first every trip to Disneyland  Paris and cant wait to go back.  The Pixar and Mickey the Magician shows are just outstanding.  I went to both twice over two days and would have went again if we hadn't run out of time.  Even the storm on our first day didn't ruin our trip although it rained heavily for the entire day.  Our teenagers aged 16 and 13 loved it. Make sure to have ponchos and silicone shoe covers or wellies for the little ones to keep dry.  Its a long day and being wet from head to toe isn't ideal.  We purchased our park tickets direct and were surprised not to be allowed to change the dates in advance when a storm was forecast.  My husband had a major spinal surgery in January and only just received a letter from the surgeon the day before our trip which didn't allow us to go through the proper channel to get a pass .  The letter unfortunately didn't suffice at customer service so we had to buy fast passes as he could not stand in the queues.    I would recommend if buying this to be prepared that the 90 euro per day for the pass as shown on the app is from 90 euros and in fact was 120 euros per pass.  Also you can only use it once on each ride.  I would also advise you get the digital pass and a printed pass as you can loose signal in the park.  One thing that surprised me was the food situation.  I had read really bad reviews but we had a great food experience in the Rainforest Cafe.  We also stumbled across Toad Hall based in Fantasyland.  With its  beautiful stone exterior and old world charm interior it had the best fish and chips we have had in years, newspaper and all !!  Highly recommend.  I had read about rides closing without notice etc and that is unfortunately the case,  they can be closed for many hours.  Hopefully its a safety issue and not a staffing issue as the later would not be acceptable.Unfortunately due to the storm on our first day we only got to catch the light show on the second night.  The crowds are daunting however it was beautiful.  Renovation works aside the gardens and planting are just beautiful as are the little shops.  I would love to return in both summer and at Christmas over the next few years.  We had stayed in Centreparcs which is one of the Disney hotels.  I would heavily recommend you avoid this accommodation.  Having walked Disneyland for 12 hours the last thing you want to do is get a bus back only to walk another 15 minutes through a pitch black forest to your very basic bordering on unclean accommodation. The lighting situation is disgraceful I don't know how they are getting away with it.  Trying to get up and get breakfast sorted to get out early to the park is a rush.  When going again I will definitely stay in a hotel  close by. Roll on the next visit !"
"Disneyland was as magical as you‚Äôd expect. We went with the knowledge that we‚Äôd need to prepare to queue and that there would be crowds of people. So it wasn‚Äôt a shock to have to wait 30 - 60 minutes for some rides and weave in and out the people. All staff members were friendly and helpful. If, like me, you didn‚Äôt take any paracetamol, just ask for directions to the first aid room and they‚Äôll issue some after taking a few details and your temperature. The illuminations and fireworks show is great. Expect people to be a bit push/shove and kids will go on their parents shoulders - which I understand as there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd see otherwise. My advice would be, be assertive. Just like kids, if you give an inch, they‚Äôll take a mile - almost literally when watching the end of evening show. Overall, I‚Äôd be delighted to return and enjoy some of the attractions we missed."
"Disney, who haven't seen or heard about Disney movies ? Nobody ! So why didn't you go to Disneyland Paris ? Personnaly, this park took me back to my childhood 'cause i'm a big fan of Disney ! The atmosphere, the landscape, the attraction, ... Everything was beautiful, it was breathtakingly !! So I can just advise to go to Disneyland if you want to return to your childhood !"
"We had a nice time here, enjoyed the park and the fireworks show. Managed to get on a few rides and saw some characters, plus it was lovely to see the Halloween decorations and parade. All of the Cast Members we came across were wonderful and friendly, they are always willing to help!The low rating is to do with the amount of work going on in the park itself, construction walls great you in nearly every land. Yes, the park desperately needs the work as it is starting to look very tired but there must be ways to do all this work without impacting the guest experience. While we managed to meet a few characters, we felt slightly disappointed with the amount and length of time they were in the park. After having brilliant character experience in the Tokyo Disney Parks in 2023, it felt very lacking in Paris. The other main issue we had was the crowds for the firework show at the end of the day. The crowd was so dense that we waited until the hoards of people dispersed so that we could safely exit the park. In general, the crowd control was not Tokyo Disney standards but has gotten better over the years here. One thing that I want to warn others about is not a Disney problem but a human problem is the amount of selfish, self centred guests that are in the park. Not only rude to other guests but to the Cast Members as well. I found that these rude guests ruined the magic more than anything else. Also, on our last day, we were unable to reenter the park with our Magic Pass despite paying for the 3 nights/4 park days package through Disney. Luckily, a Cast Member let us back into Disneyland Parc with no problems but we found it quite embarrassing and annoying. Would we go back? Yes! We always enjoy our time in Disney, it is a nice escape from reality that is needed!"
"Disneyland Paris is truly magical! From the enchanting rides to the stunning shows, every moment is filled with joy and wonder. The attention to detail in the parks is impressive, and the staff is friendly and helpful. It‚Äôs a fantastic experience for all ages, and I can‚Äôt wait to return! Five stars!"
"I‚Äôve been before but this time was very disappointed, many rides were closed, we had early morning passes because we stayed in the new port hotel, which was lovely, but when we entered the park at 8.30 for our hour privilege only one ride was open, flying rockets, all the rest didn‚Äôt open until 9.30 so was a complete waste of time getting up early, we had a booking to have lunch with the princesses, which cost extra money, when we got to our reservation they had put me and my husband in a different restaurant to my daughter and grandchildren, after a lot of waiting and checking our passes over and over they put us all on a table in a cove separate from the main restaurant, by which time many of the princesses had disappeared, my granddaughter was pleased with the ones she got to see but it was meant to be a treat and turned into a disaster, several of the old rides could do with an overhaul, I went 20 years ago and nothing had changed except bits missing from rides due to usage over time, in the Alice labyrinth the metal caterpillar on the mushroom obviously corroded over time and fell off, and never bothered to replace, lots of construction going on, boarding everywhere which spoils the overall magic, along with rides not working like great thunder mountain, cars breaking down on the car track repeatedly and although the hotel was lovely the swimming pool was shut, so when we got torrential rain there was very little to do, for the amount it cost us we could have gone and stayed for a couple of weeks abroad full board , but wanted to go somewhere for our grandchildren, they had a good time but it should have been magical as promised"
"No where near as good as Florida. Barely any good rides THAT ARE OPEN, especially in Marvel studios. Saw this random fight show thing that's half english half french, so I couldn't tell you what on earth was going on. I highly recommend the Avengers ride though. (THEN LEAVE) Disneyland itself was slightly better. But it was  VERY busy. Its a small world is my favourite and we went on it, but the boats are so close it doesn't feel like a boat ride, just a continual snake-like conveyor belt that goes round and round. And when we wanted to go again at only 6, we go and it says ""closed but back in 5 mimutes"" SO WE WAIT. AND WAIT. AND WAIT. an hour later ITS STILL CLOSED!!!There was big thunder mountain that was pretty good as well. There was building work so the map wasn't accurate and 2we got lost multiple times.BUT THE WORST PART WAS THE FOOD.we had a food voucher that you can only use in like 6 restaurants. It was only 5pm, but it said lots of them were closed. finally we find  one on the app THATS OPEN, so we walk all the way across the park to get to it in the rain, but guess what? ITS CLOSEDü§ØThen at 7pm we find a pizza place; but with the voucher you can only get like 2 things. I got the pizza, and after a MASSIVE QUEUE, it came and we had nowhere to sit. Then we find somewhere, and the pizza is Mickey mouse shaped. Cute, you might think, but NOOOOOOO. IT MAKES IT SMALLERüíÄDO NOT RECOMMEND"
"we bought the hotel n tickets for the parks directly on the website of disneyland paris. we LOVED it at disneyland park. if u like disney n/or amusement parks you will also like or maybe also love it. we've been at both parks in 2 days which was enough, but we've been during the week and not during the main season. waiting time at the activities was very good. didnt wait too long, 45min was the longest. we had no fast lane tickets."
"I've just came back from DLP and it was OK.  Kids enjoyed it as there was plenty to appeal to them. Im happy if they are happy. Everything else that parents deal with was a Croc of S. Parades , firework shows,and leaving the park was chaos. A real frenzy. These are areas where they can't get money out of you so it really shows what they think of you as there is no attention to make it comfortable for all. BUT these are the areas that scare the crop out of kids and stress parents out. I really wanted to enjoy and come away smiling but i felt let down and disappointed at the end of each day.I've read past reviews after my experience and I laughed at the parks caring replies to others. Saying thank you for informing us, we will do better, give us another opportunity ( at a cost to you of course) and all replies to same issues going back years...  but I can confirm the same issues exist as of Oct 24. Obviously there's been no action taken  but replies show intent ;)  Looking forward to a caring acknowledgement reply and empty promise after this. My advice, Go with eyes open. Do reseach on the little things that would make a trip of a LT. etc If you know what to expect then it won't be so bad."
Absolutely loved doing this with my family & 100% would do it again. Travelled on Eurostar  to Paris then travelled in a pre booked people carrier to Disneyland Paris. Stayed in the Sequoia Hotel on site. Lovely experience had‚Ä¶ food & rooms were both really nice. 15min walk into the park with 2x security checks.
"Goodness, this is a tough one! I LOVE Disney, and the last time I visited Paris was 2019, so it‚Äôs been awhile! DLP has a lot of sentimental and nostalgic value to me, but even I couldn‚Äôt ignore how downhill this place seems to have gone‚Ä¶I just feel like they need to spend some major money on improving the Disneyland Park, it‚Äôs so outdated now it‚Äôs almost laughable: the rides are so old-fashioned and janky, I find it hard to believe that anyone is finding them impressive these days, particularly ones like Phantom Manor and Pirates of the Caribbean with their decrepit animatronics: both classic rides with stories I love, but not fit for 2024 onwards, especially with the price tag of a Disney ticket. The parade was the same one from back in 2019 but missing several floats/dance units, very disappointing and difficult to view as it was so busy in the park! The Halloween cavalcade is one I love, but again difficult to view as it was so busy! We barely saw any characters out and about, which again was very disappointing, it honestly felt like an average run of the mill theme park rather than a magical Disney experience‚Ä¶To top it off, after we waited over an hour for the nighttime shows, in huge crowds, 5 minutes before starting they announced there would be no drone show - so disappointing as that‚Äôs the main reason we stayed! No contingency in place, it really felt like they‚Äôre riding on their profits knowing people will return time and time again, without putting in any effort to make it special anymore.Even the merch has gone downhill, the quality of products is terrible, and the range to choose from is nothing special, nothing sentimental about it - you can genuinely get nicer things from Asda or Primark these days for less than a quarter of the price!Overall a disappointment, which is such a shame as it has the potential to be incredible!"
"POSITIVE THINGS: We loved our three days at Disney and even rode rides more than once. The park has a lot of good options for all ages and some of the rides are just fantastic, very well done. Ratatouille, the haunted Manor, Spider-Man, buzz lightyear just to name a few. The lines weren‚Äôt too bad but it did rain on and off. You need a good few days in the park, it‚Äôs hard to get all rides done in one day. Have a plan when you go in so you don‚Äôt run from one end to the other, it‚Äôs a lot of walking! NEGATIVE: Lack of signage, it was hard using the app as it took you on a walk about. The food options. Some of the restaurants were terrible. We purchased the full board food plan and hardly used it as the options were limited and awful. You‚Äôd be better off going to the diner and ordering from the small food truck like places. We ended the trip with the ‚Äúit‚Äôs a small world after all‚Äù and it topped it off for us! Back to Australia üá¶üá∫"
"I was expecting a stress-free magical day given we had spent ¬£600 on tickets for a family of 4 for 2 days. Wasn't the case unfortunately. I can definitely see some evidence of where the money goes; the parks are not run down at all, very well maintained and clean. I'd imagine the daily parade and closing ceremonies are expensive to hold, and the Pixar show was absolutely fantastic. But unfortunately it was difficult to really enjoy many of the things our tickets had paid for due to the sheer amount of people they allow into the parks. At the parade and closing ceremony you have to literally fight for somewhere to stand! There just isn't enough open space for each person to stand which is a bit outrageous given both are outside, open-air activities and there should be ample room! Now I know why they try to sell you extra tickets for a VIP viewing platform for these displays. Shouldn't be needed at all! Imagine my shock when I look at a crowd calendar website online which shows the park was actually only half full when we went! What volume of people are they letting in when its close to 100% capacity?! Which brings me onto my biggest gripe, fast passes. of course they are given a fancy name (Premier Access) but is a clever way of legitimising pushing-in. Don't get me wrong, I am aware most theme parks have rolled out this morally defunct concept but its so much worse at Disneyland due to the fact you're paying 2-3x as much and should be treated like Royalty with a standard pass! To have queued for almost an hour with small, stressed, bored children to have someone sashay past you and walk right onto the ride is a slap in the face given I've saved all year for this trip. There will be people reading this thinking ""Well, they've paid for the privilege"". Yes, they've paid Disney not me or anyone else in the queue. There are rude practices that go against human nature that money can't buy your way out of, and one of those is pushing in. Long queues is an issue that Disney has created by allowing too many people into the park and they are also the ones profiting from it.On the plus side, the rides themselves were very enjoyable and magical (if not a bit short, e.g. the Peter Pan ride). And the restaurants were amazing, especially the Agrabah Cafe. Unlike some more expensive restaurants it is all-you-can-eat so don't need to worry about getting ripped off with portion sizes.One last tip: shop around for park entrance tickets. Strangely, it is often more expensive to book direct with Disney. We got ours through Expedia and had no issues"
"The first and most important point I wish to make is about Marie.  Marie checked us into our room at the Art of Marvel.  Marie was absolutely outstanding and I was beyond completely satisfied with all that she did for us.  Although we had arrived slightly early, Marie was able to have the room ready for us by the time we had checked in at reception.  Marie had additional decaf coffee delivered to the room as my mother drinks a lot of decaf coffee, additional water, and bathrobes, with slippers.  Marie was extremely professional but equally kind and considerate.  All questions that we had for her were completely answered.  The room itself was wonderful.  We had a great view, it was very clean and tidy.  I used the fitness room and pool everyday and these were both a great experience.  The gym was a good size but could benefit with additional equipment as the strength equipment was very limited.  I would also recommend an antibacterial spray and tissues so that the gym equipment could be wiped down after use.  The pool was great and I would go in the morning as it opened so that I could enjoy the calm atmosphere with very few people there.  The boutique, I felt was very limited in stock.  The restaurants for breakfast were perfect as it was never full and there was a great selection of food.  The only complaint that I have is the Skyline bar.  We  went there on October 1st, in the afternoon when it was quiet, maybe 6 or 7 people there, and ordered 3 cocktails.  It took over 30 minutes for them to be prepared and served.  This seemed to be inadequate.  The coffee was also ridiculously expensive too, 5.50 euros was far too expensive.  All in all, the experience was amazing and I would definitely consider staying there again in the future.  Walt's restaurant was a highlight also, the food was great but the service was outstanding and Lucie, our server, was extremely professional.  Lucie was friendly, courteous, and unintrusive.  Lucie was able to , against all odds, seat us at a window table so that we were able to enjoy the parade."
"Lacks the magic of Disney!   Little service, poorly run. Prices are not high so that‚Äôs a bonus. Good was good and the rides still are decent."
Otherwise pleasant time spoiled by Dapper Dan. Dapper Dan picks and chooses who he would like to serve from day to day. Such exclusionary practices do not reflect well on the Disney ethos.
"I loved Disney land paris. But there were some Problems. One problem was i am gluten free and there were not a lot of food options. Second was that some of the staff where no as friendly as others, but apart from that great trip with my kids."
"I was extremely disappointed with the Disneyland Paris experience. Our daughter is only 3 and all she wanted was to meet Minie, we stood in line for 30minutes before being informed that Minie would leave before we reach her and that the line is closed. It was her last ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of the day which meant that the trip was a bit of waste.This combined with the expected commercialisation of the park left us with a poorer opinion of the entire franchise. Instead of helping our daughter fall in love with Disney, as she did with Lego when we went to Billund, she only thinks of Disney as long lines and disappointments."
"It has 3 areas; Disneyland main theme park, hollywood studios, and Disney Village. They are all closely linked together all in walking distance of one another. It is in close walking distance to the bus station and train station too. The hollywood studios and Disney Village is undergoing a number of refurbishments which makes their visits short. The main park youll definately need at least a day to see it all. Most the rides allow small children to ride attractions, even the scarier attractions such as pirates of the carribean, and phantom mansion is fine for 1 yr olds to ride too. The queues during September were around 10-30min but seeing a character took longer. We found it easier to eat in Disney village than in the park, although we did eat in Gephettos which was good value and did great portions too. I saw some families take their own food in- it is more relaxed not so strict in Disneyland Paris as Magic Kingdom, even has ppl walking around smoking. We had an enjoyable visit and hope to make another trip someday."
"Have been to Disney parks in California, Florida -and Paris a couple of times.On this occasion came with family to celebrate a family occasion.Must say that my experience was that DLP was okay but didn‚Äôt feel the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù that have previously experienced on the past due to a number of reasons:Smoking-although‚Äùbanned‚Äù in the parks (except for specific areas) people were freely smoking and vaping around children . Staff did nothing to stop this.Long, long queues-appreciate is necessary on some rides but  2 1/2 hours to meet the Disney princesses is excessive. Most rides were 40 to 50 minutes wait ‚Äì This must be butthis must be French time because it certainly took a lot longer than that to get to the actual ride once we‚Äôd started queueing.Poor maintenance- Tripped over paving stones on several occasions that were uneven. Walking up to the castle, there was no mortar in the joints in the surrounding wall over the moat!! In several areas, things are appreciably worn and although maintenance is ongoing, It felt that some TLC was needed generally.Hoarding boards everywhere! ‚Äì Lots of areas are under construction/refurbishment which gave the feel of being in a building siteFood queues- Staff had no sense of urgency in trying to serve . For example, queued up to get some coffees at a stall which also sold alcohol. The beer barrel had to be changed and although there were three people working on the stall, they all stopped to watch whilst one of their number changed the barrel. It was pointed out to them that surely they could, carry on serving others whilst this operation was completed. They did this begrudgingly! In another shop on Main Street, I queued for about 45 minutes just to get a sandwich and a cold drink. Staff were so slow, chatting to each other and seemingly oblivious to the queue of people which was stretching right out of the door. Frustrating is not the word!Character breakfast- booked this as a special treat for our party. However despite paying for this months in advance, when we booked in at the restaurant , we were told that we had only part-paid (2 people had apparently not paid). So as not to spoil the tree, we had no option but to pay ‚Ç¨100 for the ‚Äúmissing 2 people. ‚Äú.  Having just returned home, I‚Äôve taken this up with the travel company we booked through who advised that It was correctly booked and paid for and the issue is with Disney. I‚Äôm currently awaiting a response from them. However despite these issues , the children and grandchildren enjoyed their visit- which was after all the main reason for coming. However personally, I would choose to visit Disney in Florida if we ever went again."
"Fantastic place!! Yes cues can be long..... but come on it's expected. Seen reviews moaning about rides closing, well this is health and safety no Park will let you ride when it's not safe to do so."
It is real fun for whole family. We love this adventure and time we spent there. Magic show is magnificent! We would reccomend to our friends as mondatory to visit and enjoy.
We spent the day at Mickey's kingdom! It was a magical moment despite the crowds. My girlfriend loved it! We'll be back if we ever come back to Paris.
went to Disneyland Paris and my childness popped right out loved every min of the place from the helpfulness of the staff to the rides to th end of night show that was 9th sept went again on the 28th sept still the same excellent day loved every min of it sad to go
I've been to Florida and California Disney Parks and wanted to add the Parisian experience. So gladI can say I visited!  Different from the USA in size - everything seems smaller in Europe but still a fantastic experience. Loved the day!
"I consider myself a Disney Fan and I have been to Disney World many times and Disneyland once.  I had the opportunity to visit Disneyland Paris on a whim while being in close proximity.  I figured I'd drop in and check it out.  All I can say is ""Has Bob Iger visited this park lately""?  Upon entry  I noted a lot of people just casually smoking anywhere and everywhere they wanted.  Of course, this is not permitted in the USA and I can't believe that they would allow this.  Upon entering the washroom there was no soap in the soap dispenser and the bathroom looked dirty-- many stalls clogged with toilet paper and out of order.    As we entered Frontierland, again multitudes of people just having a casual ciggy and cast members just looking the other way.  We went to Coco's for lunch which was just okay.  Of note, the lighting in the cue for the pirates is so dim you can't see anything in front of you which is a risk that certainly would not pass standard in the US parks.  There is potential for this park in that some of the rides were longer and more intense than their counterparts in the USA, but the magic was lost on cast members who wore their sunglasses on the top of their heads and leaned against the wall and just really looked like they didn't want to be there.  Actually one encounter at a churro stand the cast members were just rude as they counted their change.  Small World - again lots of people just smoking a ciggy in the cue.  The water in the attraction had coins that people had thrown into the water - probably 20 years ago that were rusting at the bottom along with ciggy butts and dirt (magic is lost).  Where is the attention to detail?  You would not see this in the USA parks.  Shout out to the cast members at tower of terror who were in character and made the ride a great experience.  We wanted to find a place to eat and so decided on Colonel Hathi's which was supposed to serve Indian food.  I ordered "" Pakora"" which was definitely not pakora.  It was a dried up cold ball of what looked to be a falafel that was dried out and gross.  What was supposed to be raita was actually mayo.  Lets talk about the ""butter chicken"" and the ""dahl"".  The so called ""dahl"" was hard and chewy and the butter chicken was watered down.  They obviously buy a sauce and then water it down.  It was terrible.  In the washroom at this place, somebody had thrown a sanitary napkin into the toilet and the peeling paper as well.  On the whole, the washrooms in Disneyland Paris were not attended to and very dirty.So to try and be positive a little bit....I can say that the lines were not long and we never waited longer than 20 minutes but on the whole it is a sad and sorry park and I would say save your money and go to Disney World in Florida or Disneyland in California.  I will note that I am not an American and do not live in the USA"
Big mountain ride when opened  was over and hour long wait to get on the ride. A few restaurants  in the park you had to have reservations  in order to eat there. That would have been nice to know in advance.  (Also you had to walk to city hall which is at the entrance  of the park not near the restaurants )to get the reservations  or hoped your internet worked and did it o n the app. Which mine didn't.
"Its Disneyland Paris with some 1990s nostalgia! What more can I write? A must do on your journey in France in all seasons. But, get your big wallet and spend a week here."
Visited Paris Disney payed 130 for two adults long queue to pass security then inside could not get any proper information from staff as there english is very poor had to queue for 70 minutes to go on ride what a joke people must be starved for entertainment invthus part of the world to put up with such overpriced venue they are allowing far too many people in avoid. The Disney in Florida is away ahead
"Have been to Disney a number of times over the years here and in the states I can safely say none of the parks are as good as what they were 10 years ago  .  Yes you do stumble across that disney feeling and sparkle but more and more like the last visits to Orlando and here . There's more rides broken down more people In the park , less sparkle higher and higher costs. Is it worth it anymore ? Probably not.  Value for money there are so many better options now . Would we go again . Maybe but not for a long long time"
I went to Disneyland Paris with my sons for my birthday we got first class tickets on the Eurostar straight to Disney I went for the fireworks night many years ago it was ABSOLUTELY brilliant we stayed in the hotel sequoia lodge and we really enjoyed it my older two sons loved the rides the smaller ones and my youngest was too young for the rides. we dined in planet Hollywood and rainforest cafe my sons absolutely loved it. On fireworks night the fireworks were absolutely breathtaking they did the last fireworks to show the Micky mouse in fireworks it really was truly amazing.I would love to take my youngest again now he is older with his brothers I would definatly recommend it.
"It is a funny old place. I am sure some will love it. For others it won't appeal. I have to admit that I didn't expect to go wild over it but I was slightly disappointed. Possibly because I had incorrect expectations. I was accompanying a group of teenage schoolchildren. I think they had a great time but my honest view is that the place is geared to a younger age-group. That might cloud my judgment in this review! I did, however,  think the parades and shows were impressive but they weren't what I was seeking most. It was the rides that disappointed me. If you are looking for white-knuckle rides, Disneyland is not the place to go. If you are desiring an (expensive) day out with your young children, you may be more satisfied.Restaurants are expensive in my view for not very much food. Gardens and flowers are beautiful. Entry and exit into the main concourse is pretty straightforward but inside it is very crowded, but I accept that we were there in high summer.I am glad I went and I did quite enjoy my day but I am in no hurry to return.One final point of commendation. I was queuing for the hyperspace mountain (decent but not exceptional) when I realised my phone was missing. I worked out where I was most likely to have lost it which turned out to be true because they had my phone present and correct for collection. I don't know who picked it up but it was good to experience some honesty and to know they have an efficient system for lost property. That was a positive experience for me."
"Disney is always great with children, and without, however this is probably one of the worst parks. Yes it has great things to do, but you can see some attractions outdated and old (Pinocchio,  dumbo, peter pan, ....) you wait 1h for a 2 mins walk on something that feels like you've seen it at any travelers fair.  Compared with other Disney parks where you get better entertainment during waiting times (not to mention you wait under the sun with barely no shades ), or more modern attractions... some waits are not worth The food is a different topic, nice restaurants (some expensive but ok you see the princesses)  , but grab a sandwich is just bad, that pretzel bread, and barely filled,  just avoid it, eat outside.I'm not sure if it is because part of staff is French but in general, big smile bad attitude and rude, i thought the unspoken rule of not breaking a hug with children was real... well it is not, if you are on a queue to have a picture with some one and then time's up, the close the place, right in your face, come back tomorrow we were told (and we were the only ones/last ones waiting).MMerchandising is very limited, no movies, books, comics, same stuff everywhere, starwars and marvel is just anecdotal. In general, I'd recommend save a little bit more, get a flight offer to Orlando and go there, 3-4 days might cost the same (prices there are cheaper) than at Disney, better attractions, better food, better weather, way friendlier staff."
Very nice place for whole family.Lots of shows and characters to meet.If you want to see everything you need to book at least two day ticket.
"Total ripoff, but at least my daughter thought it was magical, I 100% knew it would be expensive I enjoyed the park,  but didn‚Äôt enjoy the long queues also loads of the water fountains didn‚Äôt work witch was very inconvenient considering the weather, all the restaurants in the park and the Disney village are over priced, you get nothing in return for your money, the food portions are tiny I‚Äôve had far bigger, better and massive meals from weather-spoons and other local pubs in England for far less money, and i couldn‚Äôt get a pint of Stella anywhere, and take your own tea bags their ones are gross, the food prices and food portions ruined everything for us, it should have been far better considering the price of everything."
"Disneyland Paris, the most magical and happy place on Earth. Or so we thought. This Tuesday outside of the holiday season, you would expect some quietness in Disneyland, but it was such busy that most paths were not walkable. However we tried looking through this and enjoy. We got a priority pass because we had a ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù (autism). With the idea that he did not need to stand in the queues and enjoy too the ‚Äúmost magical place on Earth‚Äù.To our deep sorrow and fright, it was chaos in the queues. One has to enter at the exit or premium gates at the attractions, but not only disabled use this, as well the ‚Äúrich premium people‚Äù who paid money to have a quick entrance. This is horrific because especially autistic people have trouble standing in queues/lines, therefore they have the disability pass to skip them and let them enjoy too. These people just bumped against him like he wasn‚Äôt there, and even the lines were much shorter, there were huge lines due to these ‚Äúrich premium people‚Äù.Also the Disney employees who are supposed to be happy and make people smile and appreciated, especially disabled, didn‚Äôt smile at all, were sometimes rude, uninterested/cold, tired and had poor English language skill. There were some exceptions of employees, one which was exactly how it was supposed to be. He took us personally all the way to the front, making sure nobody bumped against us (the people who were exiting). He took care with passion and love. He was sadly a rarity in general.We ate at a ranch restaurant, where we paid ‚Ç¨108 in total. The menu choice was poor and the portions incredible small. I wasn‚Äôt satisfied and felt hungry afterwards. The weirdest thing was uneatable desert, it was popcorn, vanilla tofu, jam and blue berries, it was horrendous.The worst of the day, which ruined all completely, was the sudden closure of parts of Disneyland around 19:45-20:00, this resulted into chaos, people were forced into a single direction and only one road was open, it felt like you had to walk the entire park through to get anywhere near the Castle of Sleeping Beauty for the fireworks/lightshow. For people with autism this is disaster, and feels like the disabled are left on their own and not taken into account.For the parade there is a section for the disabled, but as well here, the absolute ridiculous thing is that it is the same spot where the premium people are put. Resulting in a crowded place full of people, the disabled (also lower wheelchairs) not seeing anything because these people are in front, and the autistic are getting overstimulated. There is as-well no place to sit and you have to stand almost 1 hour.Disney employees are pointing with their flashlight sticks in your face, why can‚Äôt they normally warmly speak to you, to hive you at least some magic feeling.The show was somehow okeyish, the lights on the castle are beautiful, as is the projection. The show is long. The drones didn‚Äôt happen because it was bas weather. A pity but well not someone can do much about.When the show ended, it was only announced in French. A million people rushed for the exit I was crushed against a fence, and the only place to escape to was a security entrance gate (which is an entrance to go into the park) and I asked them kindly and with urge if we could exit through it (there was nobody, and the station was next to it) and the man first ignored us (and our disabled child) and than said rudely we have to go back into the crowd, he pushed us. I said we have a child with autism. He just laughed and pushed us back in the crowd. Unbelievable this is the way a Disney employee treated a disabled person (and his family).We didn‚Äôt see any Disney characters the entire day, we looked for them, but there were zero.All with all, a horrific day that has been remembered by our family as the worst day in the ‚Äúhappiest place on Earth.Please avoid at all costs"
"Best themepark of the world! Feel the Magic of Life! We've been for one week in the Caribbean Beach Hotel near the Skyliner. It's fantastic to fly to Hollywood Studios and Epcot by the Skyliner. We loved to go to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom by the very well organised Lyft taxis instead of the crowded shuttle bus or monorail. Our most visited and exciting park was Hollywood Studios with Galaxy‚Äôs Edge as Star Wars fans. The Blackspire Outpost and it's Rides represent a peak of Man's ideas and techniques of realising science fiction!  Thanks to George Lucas and Disney. The new Lightning Lane system is a perfect invention that people who are willing to pay extra get all their rides they want at the time they prefer in their holidays. It's better than the fast-pass years ago and I don't want to mention the awful Genie system. The Dining Plan with snacks, Quick Lunch and just one Table Service is not bad but there should be a rethinking if guests want table service only and pay for it.The shops were less than five years ago and there were less shops with for example jewelery or crystal figures. But there were many gimmicks and things we've bought my credit card confirms üòÄ. To put it in a nutshell THIS PARK IS MAGIC and THE BEST IN THE WORLD for all ages and all interests and all occupations. Disney World Orlando, WE LOVE YOU!"
"I have been going to Disney every few years since 1978.  Always magical!  Not anymore.  We returned from there after a five night stay in January 2025 realizing the magic is gone and the Disney brand has fallen far indeed.  The customer service was abysmal.  Cast members were rude, unhelpful, openly on cell phones and completely disregarding guests in lines, discussing their conflicts with their bosses in the gift shops, complaining of short staffing, and the list goes on.  When we returned, I reached out to them by phone.  Was told I had to email complaints.  I emailed and was dismissed and told that they were glad we managed to find two positive experiences in the midst of the experience and hoped we would return.  It took two more emails and a request for a call to discuss the poor service received.  They care nothing about the guests and only about the money.  They could have cared less that their staff appeared miserable and unfriendly.  They think that their brand will carry them.  We won‚Äôt be back and for those planning an Orlando trip go to Universal Studios.  Service was impeccable.  Parks were clean.  And it is cheaper."
"I recently had a disappointing experience with Disney that has left me frustrated and dissatisfied. In January 2025, I purchased a $100 shirt at Disney World Park in Florida, but when I got home, I realized it was the wrong size. I tried to return or exchange the shirt for a different size but was informed that it was no longer eligible for a return or exchange despite the recent purchase.Being unable to swap a simple item like a shirt, especially when the purchase was made within weeks, is I expected better customer service and more reasonable return policies for a company of Disney's stature, especially given the premium prices they charge for merchandise. Not being able to swap a simple item like a shirt, especially when the purchase was made within weeks, is really disappointing. It‚Äôs a shame that Disney doesn't seem to prioritize customer satisfaction in the same way it does its entertainment and theme parks. I won‚Äôt be rushing to buy more merchandise anytime soon. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars at the Parks, the Channel, and more. Never again! This is disturbing"
"We celebrated my daughters 12th birthday at Disney. We did Magic Kingdom which was amazing and had a very classic vibe, loved space mountain, the classic castle. Our ultimate favorites were Disney Studios because of the epic Star Wars area. OMG!!! If you want everything Star Wars that is the park for you. My daughter made her very own droid!! What an experience that was, we had drinks at the Cantina and even did the smugglers run in the Falcon! Next was the Animal Kingdom, let me tell you I was super emotional when I saw Pandora, they brought the movie to life. My daughter built her own Avatar on her Birthday. They really do it special. We did the epic ride on Avatar Flight of the passage, you feel like you are really riding on Na'vi, I balled my eyes out it was so real. Highly recommend and the Na'Vi river journey. Such an amazing experience. If you are leaving from Canada and you can go through AMA travel, do it!"
"Disney parks are no longer the wonderful fun parks üòï Far too expensive, not worth the money,  and  has lost its magicüòí  The whole complexes is run as a total business to exploit as much money out of you as possible while you're there,"
Experience was great! The only thing was I wish the fast passes were a bit better. You have to reserve a fast past spot and you cant reserve anything else until you are past that time. I don't know if it was becuase we were just coming back from universal with fast passes when we could go whenever we want but just don't buy the fast passes there not worth it my best part about this trip is Epcot. It was so fun we were there for new years eve( I know it says March 2024 that's the earliest I could go in my review but we went December 2023-January 2024) and I loved the fireworks!
When you experience the delays beyond the lines for rides you will never go back. Disney operations are behind the times and they could not care less. Security guards are inexperienced and have a hard time operating the old and outdated magnetometers for the tram to get from place to place. Long lines and rude guards cause constant arguments in front of kids. Not good for the Disney future and apparently the result of typical apathy by management that have given up. Buses are constantly late and behind schedules. These delays lead to missed rides and entertainment. Kids get frustrated. Old buses and unchecked traffic lights cause these problems. Again a problem from overpaid yet incompetent corporate executives. Consider other options or get ready to get upset
"Now I know it says my review was posted in February of 2024, but I actually went in October of 2023. So, Disney was not lying. Disney is ‚ÄúThe Happiest Place On Earth‚Äù. How? Glad you asked. Friendly staff, amazing food and beverages, amazing rides, it‚Äôs amazing! If you‚Äôre ok with spending some type of money, this is the place for you. I went with my friend, but family is also recommended!"
"The most miserable place on earth! Forget the lightning passes, some rides don‚Äôt even take it. Hours of wait times for short gratification. Tourist traps at best and I live in a tourist town in South Carolina. I hope once I leave Orlando I never have to return.  As far as Disney, I did have some fun at Hollywood Studios. Everything else was awful."
"Very nice resort. However, it is outragously expensive! It's hard to find a decent priced vacation for 4 adults and 2 teens under $3000.I'd like to add that I booked Universal Studios for 2 teens and 4 adults, 2 volcano bay resort view rooms, for 7 days with photo package and 4 day parks for only $2800. However, Disney wanted to limit my resort choices and charge me over  $5000 for a standard room for 5 days and 1 park day. We will have to consider Universal until Disney has better deals. Thanks."
