Absolutely magical experience for our first time  at Disneyland. We loved every second of it and can‚Äôt wait for our next trip.  We loved meeting all our favorite characters and the Star Wars ride was exhilarating  and so fun!  Seeing the castle for the first time was truly magical and was just brilliant. I really can‚Äôt wait for my next time!
"This was a very magical experience. Everything was at a high standard including service and interior. We stayed in a deluxe room which also included the d lounge for breakfast and afternoon tea. I wasn't sure what to expect for afternoon tea, however, it included miniature savories as well as dessert and treats including your drinks. So instead of lunch we would often come back to the hotel and have afternoon tea. The staff couldn't do enough for you. I wish we could have stayed longer, however, we are planning on returning again this year. We drove here so parking was nice and easy and very safe."
"I went with my husband and we had a lovely experience, in the night its very beautiful and different. Would love repeating itüòçüòçüòçüòç"
"I am going to write this review before visiting and will write another after we have been.  This review is based on the website and information gathering.  I think the website is shockingly bad.  To be able to gather simple information like location of rides, where to meet Mickey and simple information.  Terrible.  I have called 3 times to book into the Disneyland Hotel and each time the call did not deliver what I wanted.  First time the call handler was very off hand and did not explain all aspects, the second call I booked but did not get an email confirming the booking, the third call, I tried to book the Royal Banquet and it was not booked.  Really poor experience before arriving.  I so hope it improves when we get there."
"Excellent , again to come  with my family & friends , try to complete as much as rides which missed during the visit ."
"The kids loved it and enjoyed every ride they slept like babies on the way home, also found it easy to access by train. Will defo come back"
"I haven‚Äôt even been to Disneyland Paris yet however I want to comment on how poor Disney‚Äôs customer service is. I have booked a trip to the Davy Crockett ranch for may. After booking this I decided to add on character dining for breakfast. When I was making this booking the website had a glitch at the payment stage. I checked my emails to check if the payment went through and there was no confirmation email. So I tried to book it again and it was successful with confirmation straight away.Then I discovered Disney has charged me twice for the booking. However on the emails and account only shows 1 booking. I have been disputed this ever this. Almost 3 weeks and no resolution. I am ¬£206.26 out of pocket which might not seem much for a billion pound company but for me it is. Every time I call or email they just fob me off saying it‚Äôs with the accounts department. I am shocked by the lack of efficiency or urgency from Disney. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm getting my money back and making me second guess the holiday. Did not expect this, I thought it would be a first class service. If this happens to anyone else good luck."
"I love Disney and brought my kids up with beauty and the beast, Bambi and Mickey Mouse. Sadly I think I went there 20years too late and I didn‚Äôt get the whole magic thing. What‚Äôs the magic in queuing for hours for a 2 minute ride, standing in the cold for 30 minutes to meet a character and spending around 12/13 hours out each day with no real provision to relax. We spent a small fortune on food and hot drinks. The whole park runs like clockwork but it‚Äôs just so busy. Apparently according to the data we chose the quietest week to go ?? Really, it was packed everywhere so I dread what it‚Äôs like in peak season. I‚Äôll keep watching the films but sadly I won‚Äôt be returning to the park"
"I spent three unforgettable days at Disneyland Paris with my son, and it was truly magical! We met every character, took tons of pictures, and collected signatures‚Äîit was a dream come true for him.One of the highlights was having breakfast with the characters, which was so much fun, and the buffet was really good. Lunch at the Royal Banquet was also a great experience, with delicious food in a beautiful setting.The park itself is massive, and even after three days, there were still rides and attractions we didn‚Äôt have time for. Every moment was exciting, and the attention to detail in every corner of the park was incredible.The only downside was the long lines and waiting times, but overall, it was an amazing experience that we‚Äôll never forget. Highly recommend for families!"
Very long queues for rides.   Pizza and the pasta bolognese at the Stark cafe was awful.   Staff were friendly and helpful.   I would not recommend it as an attraction unless it is for very young children who seemed to enjoy the parade at 5:30PM.
Terrible customer service - payment taken 3 times by Disney which left us penniless with our two young children and still  not refunded  12 days later! Family of four split up for Princess breakfast which paid extra for! We had to return home as no money - at resort we were  told there was nothing they could do we had to email but we were unlikely to get a  response for at least 48 hrs. We received an automated email and are still waiting for our overpayment to be refunded 12 days later! Shane on you Disney!
"*Fantastic, extraordinary ‚Ä¶.Don‚Äôt miss it if u come to Paris. You can get there by train easily by about 4‚Ç¨I think it‚Äôs better to set a complete day for your visit and suggest you stay there till the night to see the Beauty of lightening too.It has 4 part: Frontier-land, Adventure-land,fantasy-land and discovery-land. I like fantasy and adventure more than the others.These places were more interesting to me:*Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril*Sleeping Beauty Castle*Pirates of the Caribbean*Pinaccio*Peter Pan's FlightYou can eat there by normal and average price.*Considering there is no place to charge your mobile except a place called ‚ÄúArcade alpha‚Äù (you can find it in the map) so go there with full charge mobile and your charger.*You should buy a ticket by 54‚Ç¨ and there is no need to pay more anywhere in any station. It‚Äôs priced is really fair.*The staffs are so friendly and supportive ‚ù§Ô∏è*Dress comfort and easy specially your shoes because you will have a long walking.*If you have kids take stroller and don‚Äôt take them to strange and dark places, some of the attractions may be offensive or scary for them.*The lines are too busy but you can pay more at the city hall and skip the lines üòêit‚Äôs too bad because they show the children: you can pass others by money üòí I think it‚Äôs not a good idea for making money, they can change the entrance price to the upper price to earn more, but act to all in a same way. It‚Äôs a bad role model for children so I decided to give 3 star to wonderful Disney land.* people have to stay in a long line for a 2 minute show or train, it‚Äôs no frustrating specially for the kids.* no need to get your."
"Disney land is an emotional roller coasterThere are times when you are in there where you think it's wonderful and then times when it is a bit of a nightmare My experience was that Disney land brings out the worst in people, most people are ordinary folks who have worked so hard   to get their families in here and they are desperately trying to get their money's worth, there is an under tone of desperation from people, running around trying to avoid long queues, trying to keep kids warm in freezing temperatures, screaming toddlers straped into prams ,  people worn out from queuing for 80 minutes for a 2 minute ride , it's quite soul destroying at times .  The merchandise in the shops is beyond over priced , don't feel the pressure to buy anything they are ripping you off so badly its kind of upsetting as it's heart breaking for us minions who are trying to experience the "" Disney magic "" My tip is download app before you go and familiarise yourself with it , you can check queue times on app , pick 3 rides a day you really want to go on and pay for fast track , it cuts about 20 minutes of your wait Bring in a phone bank for mobile as the app saps life out of phone Prepare yourself for long long long queues , so long I honestly can't see the point in going, it was so disappointing , try and bring in your own water and food as Disney food is not good, unless you book restaurants which I believe are nice but I shudder to think what they cost Be prepared for people vaping all the time , lovely big blow backs of some vile strawberry flavour 2nd hand smoke in your face constantly, Disney seriously wake up and ban vaping it's disgusting Also so many people taking photos obviously for their socials so they can show the world their "" Disney dream "" one lady actually asked me and my son to move so she could take multiple shots of herself with Disney in background, we were just taking a small break and taking in the surroundings , it was very annoying The whole thing has become about people  getting photos for social media pretending to the word that they are living the dream Unless you earn massive money avoid this place , it bleeds you dry"
I had planned our visit extensively for our visit on 23 December and thought I was ready.  We had purchased return transfers from Gare du Nord but on the day at the designated pick up spot  we were met by a Disney rep and had to walk 500 metres to another location to meet the bus.  Sense of arrival was great and we loved  the Christmas tree and decorations.  Wait times were crazy even early in the day. One of the highlights was the queen of hearts maze.  We spent 90 minutes queuing for its a small world and then discovered you could buy individual fast passes for as cheap as 9 euros per person.  We did this for most major rides to save hours in the queues.  This could have been better promoted.  Crowds were next level.  We loved being able to buy champagne in Disney glasses at top of Main Street but surprised they only took cash.  Overall the kids enjoyed their visit.  Pirates of the Caribbean was popular. Poor signage getting back to our bus meant we missed it and had to get a BOLT
I just don‚Äôt know why - but for me there is no doubt that this has to be the 2 worst Disney parks there are. The park is one of the most beautiful ones - Details in every corner - lovely theming and classic attractions. BUT - the Disneyland park has not seen anything new within the last 30 years. Not a single attraction is state of the art.The wait times are beginning to get outrageous .. even during off season. Why ? Poor operations and questionable ride opening hours. As hotel guest you get early entry- unfortunately not a lot of attractions are available at that time - meaning that you wait just as much as you do if you don‚Äôt show up early. The same for closing - why do most attractions close at 17 ? Why - just to boost wait times for no reason. Once the parade is over with small kids - you just have to sit there and wait for the firework to finally happen. And what is the deal with pins and the guest service building ? Why take out the few things that are free and fun - but don‚Äôt cost anything‚Ä¶ not really magical. Why make a big fuzz about not being able to enter that building - same here artificial created wait times- inside the building are more staff members than 3 attractions combined ‚Ä¶ not sure what they are actually doing there.
"Bought a 2-park 3-day pass for Paris Disney and it was the first thing we did on a 6 week family adventure so expectations were high. Mid December and the park was decorated beautifully for Christmas, with lights, trees and fake snow down Main Street throughout the day. A few rides at both parks were under redevelopment which was a bit disappointing but we still had plenty to do. We're not big on thrill rides but did do Crush's coaster and Thunder Mountain which were lots of fun for these 2 teens and 50-somethings. The classics such as It's a Small World and Pirates of the Caribbean were great and the Ratatouille ride was fantastic (although not good for vertigo!). Food was average and overpriced, ride queues averaged 30 minutes (we did wait 50 for Crush's coaster), we could have paid for a fast pass but hubby was not keen given how much we'd already spent on entry tickets. The stage shows were next level and production values are high throughout the parks. My nearly 18 year old got to live her disney princess fantasies and the 14 year old boy was impressed with it all. The evening drone show is particularly good.Thankfully we bumped into a fellow Aussie who gave us some helpful advice about meals. So after wandering around aimlessly on day 1 we used the Disney app to its full advantage for days 2 and 3. On day 2 we booked lunch at the PYM kitchen all you can eat buffet. Even if booked out it's worth refreshing and keep trying because people do cancel. The food here was actually very good. On day 3 we prepaid for burgers at cafe Hyperion and skipped the main queue to go to click and collect, Well worth doing.Beware - there is a disney tax in everything and you WILL spend lots of money on merch! LOLOnce in a lifetime Disney trip! Despite the cost, will do it again."
"I am a young woman who was physically assaulted by a man my father‚Äôs age in Disneyland Paris in August 2024.I have been going to Disneyland Paris for years and many times but that was the last time I would step foot in there after how badly they dealt with this.I have emailed and showed pictures from the assault and it is all documented in guest relations and with the security there and the email I received back from them they may as well of said ‚Äúwho cares, not our problem‚Äù.The incident took place in August 2024 in the line for Mickey and the magician. I was with my two sisters and we were all lining up. A man grabs me by my arm in the line and tugs me backward to get in front of me. This left a huge bruise on my arm with indents of his fingers from the force. I began shouting please don‚Äôt touch me and he laughed and said I didn‚Äôt. His wife then got in my face and threatened me, and his son was yelling that his father didn‚Äôt. I was roaring crying and when we went inside I went and said it to the cast member. While I was telling the cast member the son came over and interrupted and said his father didn‚Äôt touch me. I asked the cast member for the security footage so I could show them exactly what I was talking about and I was disgusted that there is no video footage in the lines (which is absolutely shocking!).I told the cast member it was assault and I was visibly upset. She told me she would get someone after the show to come over and talk to us. Looking back now what horrific way of dealing with this. They let a man who assaulted a girl sit down and enjoy the show while I can‚Äôt breathe or enjoy the show as I had a panic attack.After the show we waited (myself and my sisters) and went to the girl and were told the family left (of course they did they ran as soon as possible) and the security were outside looking for him. Security were nice and took it seriously however why would this be allowed ? We allow people who assault others to sit and enjoy the show? So Disney only care about its money and not the safety. I went further and made the report to guest relations where o was given a fast pass for the show.Like seriously? A fast pass for a show I have trauma for now and could never line up on that. I suffer with anxiety and the distress this entire situation was for me to this day is upsetting. I didn‚Äôt go back to the park the next day out of fear. I have been having therapy for 5 months now on how to deal with queues and lines and get over the assault. I will try attach the picture and show you how bad my arm was left and how Disney allowed a violent man to watch a show and roam around the park not caring the distress caused to others.Disney you should be ashamed. I have told everyone high and low and warned people not to go. Before I told people I allowed a saving grace of their email to redeem how wrong they were. The reply as mentioned earlier basically said not their problem and I can try attach the picture of this too. Ruby from guest relations who responded did not care in the slightest. You wouldn‚Äôt get this treatment in Disney world where they bend over backwards to protect and help guests. Disgusted.Watch out for your safety if you go. They didn‚Äôt for me."
"Unfortunately due to the red warning storm we had in Scotland last Friday, our trip was cancelled by the airline. @disneylandparis refused on the Friday to move the date, or refund for the 2 day tickets for the Saturday.Incredibly poor for a childrens theme park, never mind with one with such a wonderful reputation. We rebooked the trip at great expense to visit again this weekend, but it seems we have to purchase 2 days tickets once again. I provided proof of our trip cancellation, but they were unwilling to assist. Incredibly surprised and disappointed by this decision, as is my 4 year old."
January trip but found parks to be absolutely heaving with ridiculous queues and hated every minute never again I‚Äôm sorry ‚Ä¶ paid for half board and food was awful it used to be superb. Shame on you Disney. As for our room ‚Ä¶ turned on TV and no Disney channel ??? Are you kidding ! We needed a chill and nothing in English other than CNN ? Will never return
"This was our very first time visiting Paris and Disneyland Paris. We just couldn't get enough of the whole experience. It was the highlight of our whole trip. All of us adults and kids are still dreaming of the whole experience. The staff was amazing and super helpful. Walt Disney Studios Avengers Campus with the theme song playing gave us goosebumps every single time as we are hardcore Marvel fans. The character performances were fabulous. If only we could get a prior notification when each character comes out on the street or the roof would have been fantastic. I couldn't beleive my eyes when I saw my favourite character Loki. I missed the show as I didn't know when it was happening. It was a minor hiccup compared to the whole next level experience with superb rides, the Disney stars on parade. The younger kids loved meeting Mickey and Princesses. The Avengers Flight force ride was out of this world. Since we had only 1 day to cover most activities we missed out on most. It was surprising it was still really crowded during winter but queues moved fairly quick. Unexpected meet with Captain Jack Sparrow was epic. He was so kind to stop and take a pic with me. Web Slinger, Ratatouille, Phantom Manor, Small World are few main rides we did. The other family went in all the kids rides on Disneyland Park. The lights how at 8pm was so magical and standing outside in the freezing cold was totally worth it. The restaurants werenot too crowded but we grabbed bites from trucks as we wanted to do more activities. Wish we had more time to do more rides as 1 day is definitely not enough for the 2 parks. Will need atleast 3 days. Next time we will definitely choose   to stay at a Disney Hotel so we can enjoy extra magic time before the general crowd. Using the Disneyland Paris app was also super easy. Will definitely give this wholesome family fun experience a 10 out of 10."
"Spent 2 days at dlp last week, alot of people saying that disney has lost its magic,I agree with this to a degree and it must up its game in regards to make sure guests have a magical time,hardly saw any members of staff roaming the park apart from the cleaners,also a big reason why the magic is lacking is the state of society in general, angry rude ignorant people, who have no regard for other visitors openly smoking and vaping anywhere they please, pushing anyone in there way,still we made the best of it and enjoyed disneyland Park only waiting between 5 and 20 mins for the rides we wanted, we visited 2 years ago and thought the parades and nighttime show was far better than this time,as for the studios we thought this was terrible far to much work going on and very over crowded with nowhere to walk or sit down so left after 30 minutes and returned to the other park,disney village was also undergoing a big refurbishment ,will probably wait a few years before returning when hopefully the refurbishment will be completed.."
From the first gate it reminds you of happiness and joy that all of us have been experiencing since we were little. Disney gives you your childhood memories and takes you back there.
Worst place their behaviour quality is not good staff was not good I would never recommend you all to visit over here because when the entry become full they only allow Europe passport holders not give the priority of tourist worst place worst everything
"Always have a magical time at Disneyland Paris, where the staff, the shows, the night illuminations really help with the magic. The new show really was good with the projections in the main street, which we already had experience in Disneyland California but this was so nostalgic and right into the heart, so a top feeling just before you leave the main park. Staff was great, food was good and snacks as well. Stayed at Sequoia for the 1st night, got a really nice room and had a really good experience at check in with Nuno Lui, who made sure to let us know the luggage could be transferred to Disneyland Hotel in the morning, which meant we got straight into the parks in the following day. I didn't know this so the fact that he paid attention to what I told him was gonna be our plan and tailored for us, was TOP. We had our bags in our room around 6pm, which was before dinner, so were able to get ready for our Manhattan experience with 0 fuss. Once in Manhattan, we had a great experience, where Nicolas took very good care of us, food was great and he made sure the dishes my wife picked didn't contain tomato, as she is allergic. We had a great experience at the Royal Banquet, or so we thought, but sadly, my wife got sick in the middle of the night. I know this is a buffet but I still feel once I told the staff she was allergic to tomato we should have been taken around the buffet to understand what she could eat, as she did her best to pick the dishes she thought didn't contain but this is a bit of a mission impossible, resulting in a really bad night before our last park day.We had a good experience at the Stark Industries and at the food carts we got around both parks for some nice snacking / small bites and also, at the Disney Village at the Steakhouse and Annette's.There are a few things to mention here that for me are the reason why this trip will never be a 5 start for me and my wife. I paid 85eur for a photopass for my 3 days and came home feeling like I paid 8.5eur per photo. There was 1 single magic spot in all our stay, never see photopass photographers anywhere, a lot of characters don't have this as well, so why are we being charged so much for it? The difference between Paris and the american parks is huge, I always come home with so many memories from the american parks photo wise and sadly with barely any from Paris. The price of premier access is insane, will have again to mention the genie in Disneyland California, which even includes photos!!!! and is so much cheaper than Paris. I'd definitely prefer to queue 5/10 minutes and have more people access it than feeling that you need to be rich to have access to these experiences. Also, there's still a lot of main rides not included with it, I think after paying so much this should really feel premier. Also, aware of the state of Walt Disney Studios right now with the re-theming and understanding with that but it does mean place gets too crowded in the few tunnels where we can pass to go from one side to the other of the park, and really not feeling a lot magical right now. We still enjoyed the attractions there and the pixar show is always a good experience. A bit disappointed with the night show, feeling like it's lacking and was a waste of our time."
"Ok, Where to start‚Ä¶ so me and my husband booked a last minute trip to Disneyland Paris. The whole experience from start to finish have been awful. The buses running to and from the hotels to Disneyland are not regular you will be waiting atleast 45 minutes for the bus, by then lots of people are waiting already and you are crammed onto the bus like sardines.  If you have anxiety or are claustrophobic AVOID getting the bus. And when going from Disney to the hotel you have people shouting TAXI TAXI TO HOTEL GOOD PRICE every 5 seconds which was incredibly draining and not what you need after a long day out. Going into Disneyland everything is extremely lackluster.  There‚Äôs a lot of walking but not really much entertainment or things to see on the way. No where to sit down and relax.  Hardly any cast members around.  A lot of park works going on at the moment with boards up and stuff blocked off.  A lot of the rides were shut for refurbishment.  Me and my husband booked a table to plaza gardens and was left to wait outside in the rain before 30 minutes had passed so we just left.  The food prices are ridiculous.  In the whole of Disney. Nothing is run correctly and honestly Disney should be ashamed of themselves.  French people in general are incredibly rude.  They push past you ,barge into you and they do not apologise.  Honestly this has been the worst holiday I have ever been on and I have been a lot of places.   I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anybody to visit Disneyland Paris.  Go to Disney world Florida instead don‚Äôt waste your money here because you will regret it.  SPEND IT ELSEWHERE! If I could give this place 0 stars I would We also stayed at the grand magic hotel which was not a good experience but that‚Äôs for another review."
I booked a one day park ticket for my little sister‚Äôs 21st Birthday and we were in re so excited to go. Unfortunately 3.5 days before we were supposed to go we were informed by our airline that there was a Status Red warning all flights would be either cancelled or delayed. We rescheduled our flights to 2 days later so we could still celebrate. I informed Disney immediately but because I was 6 hours outside the cancellation period there was nothing that could be done. For a company that is centred around family and celebration of we were shocked that they refused to even change the date by 2 days.I cannot believe that such a huge organisation whose focus is family fun would not even try to be accommodating in such unforeseen circumstances and has really left a negative impression with me and ruined a special birthday.
"Spent Monday-Friday last week here, unfortunately lots of things were closed without any previous notice. With it being -5 at times, there was no shelters, no cafes & there wasn‚Äôt really a Disney feel going on. Rides were constantly down in hour before it opened to the public so it was no use being early.The rides themselves were amazing but everything else wasn‚Äôt great."
"Been here six times as a family of 4 and can say the magic for us isnt there anymore. Disney really needs to sort out the que system!  So many people push in to catch up with their family instead of que together. Happened so many times the three days just barging past like you don't exsist, no excuse me or thank you. The last family had done this to us, 4 of them was in front of us then next minute at separate moments 7 of them barged past us, no manners, no excuse me just pushing past physically touching. We are not a argumentative couple but did end up having a confrontation with this spanish family and apparently we are 'british people' ...  For a family that have to que in all ques all day and not in special assistance it can be a long day especially in the cold with two small children and the constant rudeness and que pushing from certain people is ridiculous!!  So many selfish people around but they dont care as there is no enforcement.  Disney has also swapped the dream factory to a Minnies Musical moment, what a rubbish swap! Such a poor show especially if you have seen the dream factory!! It is a standing show and i wouldnt rush to que as we was near the front but once you go first room you are pushed back with everyone rushing in a small door pushing you. Buzz ride is still backing up and you feel like you stop so much.Spiderman broke the first time but fortunately the staff kindly let us go again.Characters are a bit limited. We went to see Minnie mouse and luckily got there when we did as they shut the que off. It was a long wait as special assistance line was also full.We have been to both disneyland paris and disneyworld Orlando many times and would recommend you save your money and visit Orlando! Stayed in hotel Cheyenne which was disappointing and room wasn't clean, only good thing is its a walk away and magic hour."
"Fourth time here, and probably the last time. It was a terrible experience. Lack of animation in the streets, very poor. Waiting times specially for young kids it should be some kind of animation to help children enduring the waiting times. Restaurants that we tried overpriced and very poor food quality . Only show that we really enjoyed was the Parade as we went home shortly afterwards . Poor ‚Ä¶ very poor experience ."
"DLP is a waste of time, half of the rides & restaurants are closed, which means that you have no shelter from the freezing -2 weather at the moment. It‚Äôs full prices for half services, which is absolutely disgraceful. Disney should be ashamed of themselves although they don‚Äôt care one bit. Even the Disney shops look second rate, more like a character shop at the premium outlet in Florida than a proper Disney store."
Brilliant place not really into Disney but this place has so much to see and do must admit I did enjoy the studios more than the park myself but kids enjoyed it all and that‚Äôs the main thing.
"We went to Disneyland Paris on 18th January. We started in Disney studios and were let down that a lot of rides and attractions were closed for modernisation and renovation. Most of the Avengers campus was closed and Spiderman web ride was down due to technical issues. Also, the Disney characters were actively ignoring certain children, and not one cast member attempted to stop any queue jumping, in fact they condoned it by then pulling the children first who queue jumped! We moved over to Magic Kingdom which was a lot better managed, more fun, and generally better maintained. Other than the cold temperature i cannot fault Magic KingdomWe opted for Steak dinner in the Silver Spoon steakhouse which was delicious and we got a birthday cake for my son, the servers made sure to sing happy birthday too"
"So our daughter wanted us to come to DLP with her and our young grandson, as we‚Äôve done Disney World around 30+ times we said ok. What an absolute waste of money, Disney Studios only us 50 percent open you can walk round it in 15 minutes, queued to get a photo with both Antman and Goofy but obviously queuing is not something the French understand as if kids where in a Disney costume the characters brought them to the front and other little ones were pushed to the back, blatantly rude why would people pay for this I do not know. Went over then to the Magic Kingdom, which was better but again so many things closed and so many restaurants not open. We also went to the Silver Spur steakhouse cost ‚Ç¨180, for a second rate meal although we did pay ‚Ç¨25 for a birthday which was very nice.Truthfully this trip has cost me ¬£2k, when honestly it‚Äôs not been worth ¬£1k. Disney I think need to realise that when your only offering 1/2 the service why should the guests pay full price. In all in this is a waste of money and never again after this would I visit a Disney theme park."
"Went at Halloween 24, never seen it as busy, queued for absolutely everything, 1 hour 30 for 1 crappy ride in particular, ruined the experience for the entire family, wud never go back. Disney let about 10000 people 2 many into the parks, absolute joke, pure greed"
"We visited Disneyland Paris for the 13th time for 2 days (arrived on December 9th and left early on December 11). We were also visiting with two priority cards on green.The Disneyland park never disappoints. In just over half a day we were able to do all the rides (except Pinocchio and Casey Junior as they were closed).The Christmas decorations throughout the park were great, especially down Main Street.Walt Disney Studios is a great park with many good rides. The rides are normally doable in around 3 and a half hours (if not a busy day) and with a priority card 2 and half hours. We love the park but sadly a lot of Walt Disney Studios is boarded up which was a shame but we did find out during the visit it is apparently because of the renaming of the park to Disney Adventure land.The food at both parks can be unpredictable; it can either be the best you've ever had or the worst. Unfortunately, the Disney parks are not very accommodating for people with coeliac disease (gluten free). At many fast-food restaurants in the park (like Bella Notte), our only options were salads/vegan food or microwave meals that resembled and tasted like baby food. At buffets you also only have a small option of foods.Most of the staff members are very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. However, there were a few staff members who weren't very friendly.For instance, while we were getting off Big Thunder Mountain, a family member accidentally dropped their phone onto the tracks. Although we knew it wasn‚Äôt a ideal situation, they could have been more understanding and friendly. They didn't keep us informed about what was happening. When we tried to explain the situation, they just shrugged, as if to say, ""What am I supposed to do?"" We stood there without any information for quite some time and got the impression that they were annoyed with us as they kept shaking their heads at us and rolling their eyes. It would have been helpful if a staff member had quickly/briefly explained what would happen next and didn't do those gestures towards us, especially since the person who dropped the phone was only struggling to get out because she is disabled. Despite the behavior of a few workers, the majority of the staff were very helpful.The priority card generally works well, but halfway through, we realized that the green color assigned to one of our family members was not correct, as she was having difficulty with the steps and getting in and out of the ride vehicles. We were unsure what to do with the card as it wasn't the correct colour. Having the green card meant we used both the premier queue and if there wasn't one we used the disabled queue. Most of the premier queues only skip half of the main queue and then merge into the normal queue. In our opinion, there should be a staff member present at every ride where the premier queue merges with the normal queue, as we faced challenges with this merging process. For example , on the Indiana Jones ride, no one wanted to let us into the queue. When we finally found a space to join, a group behind us started pointing and yelling that we had ""just pushed in,"" which attracted unwanted attention and made us feel uncomfortable. The merging experience often leads to awkwardness since people are reluctant to let you join the line. A staff member's presence would greatly alleviate this situation.Another issue we encountered was at the ride ""Le Pays des Contes de F√®es"" (the storybook boats next to Casey Jr.). The boarding area for disabled guests has a significant gap and step between the platform and the boat, making it very challenging for those with disabilities. Staff members had to physically help everyone out of the boat. In contrast, the area where guests in the normal queue board actually has a smaller gap. It would be ideal to add something like a removable platform to make exiting the boat easier. On our second attempt at riding the ride, we went through the normal queue, which meant there was a smaller step the boat as the gap wasn't as big but the actual queue stairs and the moving boat were then an issue.Queue jumping can be a significant issue in the parks, we noticed it more in the disabled queues. For instance, While we were in the disabled queue, a mother instructed her son to run past us and duck under the barriers to get ahead in line. She then pushed us aside while waving her disabled pass in our faces, insisting that her disability allowed her to go in front of us. We tried to explain that it was a queue for everyone with a disabled pass and that it's not acceptable to push ahead or send children under the barriers then catch up. Two staff members saw this happen but did not do anything, for a brief second it looked like one of the workers was going to say something but he then backed down. The workers continued to watch, and one of them eventually walked away. The worker then allowed that family on the ride before us, despite witnessing them send their under the barrier and push past us. We also had people try push in front of us on several other rides (The Parachutes, Crushes Coaster, The Story boats) . When We were waiting for the Toy Soldiers Parachute ride in the disabled queue a large family of over 25 members in front of us repeatedly rode in groups, and when each ride ended, the group would quickly run off the ride and past everyone in the disabled queue to rejoin their relatives. This meant we were in the queue for 40 minutes and if the queue didn‚Äôt move. Thankfully on the parachutes, Crushes Coaster and the boats the worker made sure whoever was queues up first could go on first. However, sadly some workers like the slinky dog worker choose not to do or say anything at all. The Christmas parade was amazing. It was wonderful to see the festive floats lit up in the dark and the characters in their Christmas outfits. We arrived an hour early to secure front-row views. It's definitely worth the wait.The fireworks were good. It was our first time watching them in over seven years, but we were a bit disappointed to see that not much had changed. However, if you haven't seen the fireworks before, you will likely enjoy them! The Notre-Dame de Paris show was nice to watch, and it was exciting to experience something new. The Notre-Dame show was only on for a few days, so we feel fortunate to have attended. Although the Notre-Dame show replaced the usual drone show, we would still love to see the drone show someday, as we have never had the chance to watch it before.The shops at Disneyland Paris are really pricey, but you kind of expect that at Disneyland. There's not a ton of variety in what they sell, and it feels like most of it is just Stitch-themed stuff, which kind of takes away from the overall selection.I would definitely recommend a visit for all ages. There are things to do for every age group. There are many rides for thrill seekers as well as numerous rides that are slow and gentle. Even if you don't like rides there is lots of things to do like meet & greets, watch shows and parades, walk round the labyrinth, castle and also loads of photo opportunities"
The Park itself was excellent but the problem was we stayed for the display and it was late starting. The crowds were unmanageable. I saw one woman have a panic attack as she tried to leave and get through the crowds. We also tried to leave as were afraid we would miss our train ‚Ä¶there was no way out other than going through the crowds. I emailed Disney and got no reply. Just want people to know if you stay for the fireworks you cannot leave until it ends . If it is delayed you will have to wait as there is no way to get out . I would not stay for the fireworks as it was not worth the distress
"Yes, the lights are pretty and the music is Christmassy, but do you like to see Characters outdoors and actually like to eat? - Then forget it. Saw no characters outdoors all day - you'll only get to see them if you can get indoors and find somewhere to eat, but the places are always packed full, blocked by staff who'll say all day ""Sorry, we're full."" We got to the park really early and spent the day starving and judging by the misery of other people, so did they. Queues for rides are too long and it's December folks. Half of the studios was closed and what remained was underwhelming. Could barely see the castle show, as it was so rammed, so we really wished we hadn't waited until 10pm and left at 3:30pm when we were going to. This isn't the first time we've been to Disneyland Paris, but we wont be going again. A lot of money to walk around a bog standard theme park, cold and hungry."
"Another dream come true!! After 33 years of waiting I finally made it to Disneyland Paris! Like Disneyland USA our 1st ride was Space Mountain (Hyperspace Mountain) was which better than expected.  Some of the other highlights were the Dragon under the Castle, Dinner at Walt‚Äôs, BTMRR, Pirates and of course Illuminations at night. It‚Äôs now my 2nd favorite Disney Park that I have visited.."
"My husband, 5 year old son and I stayed for 2 nights in Disneyland Hotel and I feel disappointed as it was very overpriced for what we got. We had so many issues with our room, the door didn‚Äôt lock and had to be repaired twice, the phone cable was broken so frustrating when I tried calling reception, the jug didn‚Äôt work and every time we had an issue we had to go down to reception with took ages because the lifts are so slow. The manager gave us a late checkout but that was more stressful than it was worth as our keys stopped working after 11am‚Ä¶ so we had to go to reception twice and they still didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ we were lucky to find a cleaner to let us in so we could get our luggage to leave because I didn‚Äôt want to go back down to reception. The whole experience with the hotel was frustrating and very disappointing. The service was definitely not 5 star as we didn‚Äôt have a turn down service on the 2nd night so no fresh cups and restocking of the complimentary mini bar. As for the food, it was good but overpriced for what you get. Lucky we had the half board so not as bad but we‚Äôve had a lot better in France.As for the parks, we were lucky not to have to line up more than half hour for each ride but it‚Äôs an exhausting day trying to fit everything in. The cold weather didn‚Äôt help. There aren‚Äôt any nice cafes to sit and rest which was disappointing. Too many merchandise shops and not enough focus on comfort.Would we come back, no."
"Dont get me wrong, Disney is a magical place for all ages. There is always plenty of magical parades / shows and something always going on.However sadly they are slowly pricing out anyone whos not got lots of moneyThe longer you go the cheaper the admission, but most people only go for 1 or 2 days and admission costs on excess of ¬£100 for an adult per day. When its busy if you want rides and there are big queues you probably wont think that you have your moneys worth.Disney used to do a fast pass system where you got a time for a ride and could join the quick queue once you done that you could get another for another ride, but not before so that everyone got a fair chance, but now this has been scrapped and you can pay a premium price to join the fast lane for all rides, so therefore another perk for those who can afford it and not for the ordinarys.That and the expensive food and drink when you are in. You can fill your own water bottles (if you can find a working station) and bring your own food in but if you are spending all day there it can be heavy carrying lots of food.We used to go most years but it may be quite a long time before we return again"
"Awful experience, near to Surreal. 1.Terrible atmosphere 2.Don‚Äôt waste your money,This is my first time at Disneyland Paris, I have been to Disney World America twice I would rather pay the extra money and go back to the USA,.If you‚Äôre looking for a Disney experience this is far from it, 90% Of the staff are not friendly whatsoever they do not smile or have that known Disney happy attitude, they do not want to make eye contact and are Very unhelpful. Just one example, if they don‚Äôt know the answer to your question, they don‚Äôt even bother to seek help, they just shrugged their shoulders.Restaurants are shocking prices and disgustingly dirty, not just because they have a large volume of people using them, this is more like long-term dirt, the food is very low quality in every restaurant. Surrounding tourists‚Ä¶ It was almost like walking into a film, People were physically pushing (not bumping into you) and shoving walking around the Disney park and restaurants to another level, how there isn‚Äôt a fight I will never know.I‚Äôve Never experienced this to this level whether that be Disney world, Shopping at Christmas at a busy shopping mall, Night out on the town/clubs, this was really surreal, and it‚Äôs not just because of overcrowding, the people were pure rude, for example if you opened a door for shops or restaurants people would just physically push pass your family and walk in or out, with no manners and No thank you! IF YOU WANT TO RUIN YOUR DISNEY EXPERIENCE THIS IS THE PLACE!"
We had high expectations of Disneyland but were left disappointed. Not a single character was seen roaming around. The only time we saw any was during the parade and that was for a total of 2 mins and were not seen again. Majority of the rides were closed as were other shops. This was such a waste of time for us. We only managed to get onto 2 rides and during this other rides were also closing shop hours before the firework display. The firework was the only thing worth seeing. We will not be returning.
"Surprise visit to Disneyland Paris before the ride renovations started on 6/1, there is a lot of building work ongoing that others have mentioned. The Big Thunder Mountain ride was shut for most of the day (now closed for months for annual maintenance) and we had to pay for fast passes to get on it, no problem as best ride in the park.Very busy in the park on 4/1 with Christmas season finishing a day later. However able to do some rides we thought we would not get on, including Pinocchio, Peter Pan and Snow White. Some rides stupid times (Buzz Lightyear 80 minutes) for what they were.Weather was good for most of the day, some rain later which meant the drone show was cancelled but the light show was good, fireworks good as usual. Don‚Äôt bother with the parade, complete waste of time.Other gripe was Minnie was no where to be seen, replaced by Stitch at the usual character meet, sacrilege. Forced into Mickey character meet (2 hours).This place is still magical, however maybe next visit will be in a couple of years at least. Recommended."
"A magical experience with your children, the good thing about being a kid is they don‚Äôt notice things that an adult does in regards to quality, price etc. a lot of walls up for maintenance but again kids not bothered or even noticed. The whole place is so clean and has that magical feeling in the air seeing the kids faces light up at almost every turn makes it amazing so credit must go to the place.With the adult head on I must warn and be frank when I say the place once through the gates is disgustingly overpriced, for example absolutely everything is fast food at Michelin prices! We were ¬£65 for 3 microwave pizzas and a portion of pasta that was rank rotten! That‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg! The full place is just a glutton for money absolutely nowhere nice to just sit and have a drink or if you fancy a bite in a nice atmosphere, ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù are a mess with chairs and tables scattered everywhere but to be fair that‚Äôs not the staffs fault as it‚Äôs the clientele that visit the place that are so ignorant and entitled‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a place that highlights all what‚Äôs wrong with the modern world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶people would rather experience it through filming on their phones, folk constantly in the way and barging past for ‚Äòthe perfect pic‚Äô‚Ä¶..a girl was even texting whilst on a ride getting whizzed round whilst furiously typing‚Ä¶..we went to the show called ‚Äòtogether‚Äô which was amazing really well done and fabulous for the kids and grown ups too I may add‚Ä¶..full grown man row in front sat with EarPods in throughout!! Great place for kids ages 4 and above anything younger would say be a bit pointless.Be prepared to be annoyed unless you have a phone glued to your hand and are immune to being in the moment."
"We travelled here with our daughter, son in law and his parents and our granddaughters.  This was my husband and I‚Äôs 3rd visit to Disneyland Paris and this was for a double birthday celebration.  They have been more times than us. We always stay in the Newport Bay Hotel.  Although the public areas appear updated, the rooms certainly haven‚Äôt been.  The rooms are clean enough, and the beds are very comfortable, but the furniture is in a very poor state. The drawers are very hard to open and get stuck all the time and it all looks well knocked with marks. My family remarked it had not changed in the 10 years they‚Äôve been going there. All the furniture is old and marked, the carpets could do with a wash as ‚Äòcrunchy‚Äô in places.  The casement window fell off when we tried to get some fresh air in. We had to wedge it back.  The drainage in the bath and sink was extremely slow. The hotel staff were,however, lovely and nothing was too much trouble. I would especially like to commend Fiona from the Concierge desk who went above and beyond to secure an electric mobility chair from a trusted outside source for me as I am awaiting a knee replacement and my husband and family were struggling with push type wheelchairs obtained from the Stroller shop which were not designed for this extensive kind of use.  If you need a wheelchair, see the Concierge and they can arrange the delivery of ECV from their trusted local pharmacy at very reasonable rates. The concierge also recharge your appliance for you every night when you come in for the evening with no fee. So, venturing into the two parks we noticed immediately there is extensive building work being undertaken everywhere.  Studio Universal seems to have been brought up to standards we expect with a few fast rides and digital experiences in a much more modern setting although a lot is still under wraps for refurbishment.  Queues for nearly all rides range from 55 minutes to two hours.  The Magic Kingdom, Frontierland and surrounding areas seem to just be the same and our granddaughters (aged 10 & 12) found the rides a bit tame.  More suitable for younger children I think.  Nothing has changed there at all. A lot of the rides kept being closed for technical difficulties. Indiana Jones was the only fast coaster. Thunder Mountain appears to be closed for the foreseeable future.   A lot of the food kiosks and eateries were shut. This was troublesome as the weather was awful most of the time and a nice warm drink was hard to find.  The whole place was fully booked out so it‚Äôs not like it was a quiet season. The shops seemed to have less selection than on our last visit but the prices were very high.  Again, the parks were kept clean and the public toilets always clean. Queueing time much the same in all the parks.  Sadly, because the weather was so wet nearly all the parades were cancelled and that was disappointing. There was a distinct lack of characters in the parks as well. The meet and greets in the designated places were still there but with very long queues, which in the icy rain wasn‚Äôt pleasant and our youngest got too cold standing still waiting so didn‚Äôt get half as many autographs in her book as she had hoped. Would highly recommend you take your own crisps as at ‚Ç¨6 a packet it can be costly for a snack!  We all  agreed that for us, the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô is missing in what is essentially a special place for young and old to escape from everyday life.  This is just another theme park for day trippers of which there were loads! It may be a different story when all the refurbishments have been completed but I feel that will be a few years down the line.  It was full of French and Europeans. Very few visitors from the UK."
"We surprised the children on Christmas Day and Christmas became even more magical for the family with a trip to Disneyland Paris. It has been without doubt our best Christmas ever and we loved all the Christmas decorations, shows, parades and the overall atmosphere. Highly recommend a trip for an extra special Christmas. It‚Äôs cold so wrap up warm and be prepared to queue so have snacks and games ready for the kids!"
Booked for the whole day and both parks. The smaller and more modern park had the newer Disney franchises and we attempted a number of rides. Always said no roller coasters but those we went on were not too scary. Luckily they were inside and in the dark. The second park more traditional and the rides less exciting. Waited through to the two light shows. Best advice. Remember where you parked as the rush at leaving is massive. Worthwhile visit but missed Micky and Minnie
"First time at DLP for Christmas and what an experience ... the shows, the lights, the food were all fantastic (...the weather, not so much ... make sure you pack trousers!)We would absolutely go back for another New Years parade, the children loved it as much as we did, just so much to do!We stayed in the Santa Fe this time, and found the whole place clean and comfortable with great facilities for what you need whilst there (the only downside was no English-speaking TV channels except for the same 4 episodes of Timon and Pumbaa Wild about Safety!).100% recommend everything!"
"My first visit to Disneyland Paris began amazing up until the end of the day when we were told that there would be no drones for the illuminations. We waited until the end of the illuminations in hope that fireworks would occur, but sadly they did not. Due to weather conditions which would have been known much earlier during the day as it was pouring with rain and windy the entire time I was there, it wasn‚Äôt until the very end of the show we were told that due to wind, the fireworks would not occur. Whilst listening to ‚ÄòA dream is a wish your heart makes‚Äô, Disneyland Paris took my dream of wanting to see fireworks and crushed them. I am also very upset that Disneyland would have known fireworks would not be present prior to the show and did not state this until 8pm in which I and other families would have stayed and spent extra money on dinner as they waited for a show that unbeknown would not happen. If known earlier, I would have went home and enjoyed the rest of my day, rather than waste half my day waiting for fireworks. I cannot imagine how younger children felt or those who spent extra money to be placed at the front to view the show."
No words can explain the amazing and magical experience!!You have to see it and enjoy it by yourself!!
"terribly long lines, the food is scarse and small portions and way overpriced. It is an overall ripoff,  Also they yell at you in French are are visibly upset if you can't speak french."
"Having been there for Halloween 7 years prior - we were super excited to see Disney at Christmas. Would not recommend. There are crowds everywhere for everything. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel, as we had before, but the service and perks that were available then are no longer now. We opted for a superior deluxe family room for 5 and that too was a mistake. The amount you pay is not justified in any way (no close park access, no free daily fast pass for a ride, no special amenities for the kids or us. We went for new years, no special celebration at the hotel, if you want a nice dinner you won‚Äôt make a good spot at the park for the fireworks‚Ä¶ it was all in all disappointing. Obviously the team idea in general are good, the atmosphere as well. So not going for a negative rating."
"The ticket price is high.  About 290 Euros for a family of three where, jokingly, a teenage son is viewed as an adult.Once inside, I found staff to be generally rude.  We were stood waiting for the ""Parade"", something we waited 45 minutes for.  Then, along come the men in red jackets, telling us to move.  Even though we were stood in the same position as other families.  When I moved forward to ask them why we had to move when we were in line with other visitors, I looked around and our place had already been taken by others.  Did they move that family on?  Nope.  And merely for questioning why my family were being treated differently to others, I was surrounded by two security guards who tried to intimidate me.  All for the princely sum of 290 Euros.Queues for rides are long, and not well documented.  Imagine queuing 1 hour for a train ride, only to find that the queue is for a boat ride.  Were there any staff we could ask about why we were queuing.  No.  Were we the only ones thinking we were queuing for a train ride.  No.  Others were too.Also, during the stay, a lot of things were closed, or ""being improved for our future enjoyment"".  A bit of a joke, really, considering for most of us it is a once in a lifetime visit.DisneyLand in HongKong was a million times better, more polite, and more organised than this complete joke of a park in Paris.  The one great thing was the nighttime fireworks and electric show.  However, you have to arrive 1 hour in advance if you want to get to see  that too.  Basically everything is 1 hour, even at the start of the day,  Rides often last 2 minutes, no more than 5.For one ride we queued 45 minutes and suddenly they opened another lane which meant about 30 people who  were behind us were now in front of us.  A similar thing happened for the boat ride.  I am not talking about the people who pay extra for ""priority"", they just suddenly opened new lanes and let other people jump ahead.Look, I am not going to dissuade anyone from visiting DisneyLand.  All I am saying is that it is overpriced, poorly organised, and staffed by people who seem to be as miserable as many of the visitors looked.  Head to the HongKong one if you can."
"Thourghly enjoyed our trip. We stayed for 3 nights and had 4 days in the parks. Loved every minute. It was much busier than I expected and the queues were quite long. Fortunately the weather was very good, sunny but cold. On our departure very sad to leave, still lots of things we hadn't got around to. I  think my son and family, who we travelled with, will return."
"I am afraid that Disneyland Paris has gone downhill over the past few years. Having worked there in the early 2000s, and had more recent visits as a Mum with a family, I can see a stark difference. This park (of all Disney parks) now has the worst ratio of guest numbers to rides, meaning the queues are impossible. Small children cannot be expected to wait one hour for any single experience. Also, on our visit in early January 2025, there were numerous areas boarded for new construction, which should have been staggered, as it really detracts from the ""magic"". In addition, the ""Magic Hour"" (guests of Disney hotels are allowed access to the parks one hour before any non hotel guests), is now pointless, as only 3 rides opened within this hour. This was the same for each of the 3 days we tried. The management of this park have tipped many aspects into the negative, which unfortunately means the Disney magic is just not alive in this park. Despite previously being a complete advocate, I will not return to DLP. There are other parks in Europe, of other brands, that would offer much better value for money."
"A TOTAL RIPOFF !DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.Went to both Parks on 27 and 28 December 2024.Park Fully Booked over crowding- a case of pack them in - we have already got your ticket money when the reservation was made.Refurbishment work to 4 or 5 Rides and hence closed, meaning that all visitors crammed onto what Rides remained.With reduced capacity, they should have reduced the number of visitors.Freezing temperature and hence unable to sit on outside seats - totally inadequate seating inside any of the covered spaces; no benches in the queues of over 60 minutes for each Ride.No facilities to just bug a Coffee and sit for 10 minutes - they only want you to reserve in a restaurant and pay double the price compared to other restaurants outside the Parks.In one of their Theatre Shows, we were parked in with no seats, like a Cattle Truck.At the end of each of the two days, all of us were totally exhausted.Go to Efftelling or Six Flags instead - it's better value for money."
A family group of 10 persons ranging from age 5 to nearly 80 yrs old. Kids loved it despite long wait times on some of the attractions.
"Had an amazing time at Disneyland Paris! üé¢üè∞‚ú® The rides, the magic, and especially the grand closing fireworks made it unforgettable. Highly recommend this trip for anyone looking for a magical getaway! üéÜüí´ #DisneylandParis #MagicalMoments"
"We were excited to go to Disneyland, we purchased one day ticket, we chose to go to Disneyland Park.  We added the bus transportation.  So to start off, i wasn't able to download the tickets so I asked for help and one of the person that works there simply said go outside and download, which i still was not able to do.  I tried with different person and he was kind enough to help us.  The parade WAS SO SAD in comparison to the Florida Disney and the California one.  It was not what we expected.  The waiting online was not so bad, however the wait for the pics with characters was long.  It was a  very cold, day we didn't stay the whole day and took the train back to Paris which was SO EASY and direct.  There were not characters out for pictures, there are more shops  than anything. I was expecting the characters out and about so we can take pictures."
Worst holiday have ever experienced got taken back in ques as my son was questioned on height to be then told he's tall enough join back of the que staff were very rude and unhelpful avoid this place like the plague go to the America disneyland because this one is a dirty horrible environment...hotel was dirty used coffee pods in coffee machine tiles missing on the roof and the hotel room flooded from the bath leaking absolutely terrible experience
I loved it amazing the rides were amazing the hotel was amazing i went here for my birthday I loved it ü•∞ Should go there it is amazing I promise you
"Customer support just horrible. Waited more than half an hour on hold without any answer while calling on a paid line. Really terrible that to cancel a booking there is no other way than to call them on a French phone number which is not free, so the longer you wait in line the more you have to pay.An easy way to cancel your reservation online should be mandatory. This is not that advanced or difficult to implement. Fix your stuff"
"We are a family of 5. One child has ADHD and has his own access pass. One child has arthritis and has his own access pass as he likes thrill rides and other child does not. If you are entitled to a pass, get one, it's a game changer! If you didn't apply for one before you left the UK, take diagnosis documents with you and you can do there.We had a great experience with the passes. We rarely had to queue and this made our time here brilliant. Without them, I think all 5 of us would have not have had fun because of the nature of our family. We loved the rides!We loved the Disney magic. The cast members were great. We did not have one negative experience. We did experience one break down of a ride. We were on Pirates of the Carribean and the ride broke down. It took around 40 minutes for this resolved. The cast members wee great. This is something that they were used to as this ride regularly breaks down which points to a need to address is as people around us who had limited time were affected more by this. It's on every review but worth a mention..the cost of food is so high. We would have liked some hot fries so we could eat on the go but this proved difficult. At times we wanted a hot drink and this was not as easy to get as it should be.In some areas there was not enough seating. In one restaurant, there were rows of chairs but this area was closed. This is frustrating when you just want to sit and eat your food. We visited Florida last year and we naturally compared the parks.The Lion King show is better. Space Mountain is a better ride.Tower of Terror is much, much better. It is very dramatic!We didn't Ratatouille was quite as good but we still really enjoyed it. Overall, we have had a great few days here."
"Momma Mia !  I had to visit Paris Disneyland  no IF or But ! so I can bragging to  every one I  truly  been to all six Disneyland resort around the world , from Asian , USA  and Europe , USA is the best and bigger , I find Paris and Tokyo  location little small and very expensive compared  to USA , but still the Happy place in the world , fun to visit young  or old , Disneyland  Paris  is  made up  two park , Disneyland  Park and Walt Disney Studio , mountain of people very popular in Europe , some ride is over 60 mins wait ! do not set your expectation too high , you will 100%  disappointed special you been to USA resort ,  enjoy it , for a bottle of Coke is about $7 ,  we did not stop in any restaurants wait is too long ! so eat fully early before you visit here ! you need less two days to see Paris ! it is our final X'mas Holiday ! we been away since DEC 17 !  Happy New Year Every one ! Bonne Annee !"
Can‚Äôt believe this place had mice everywhere.. The staff were obviously ok with this cos they had even dressed them up in bloody clothes .. we left immediately. When I complained the staff laughed in my face.
"It was an extraordinary experience, I really enjoyed it, it's a shame that the time was very short and I didn't get to do all the games in DISNEYLAND, and the prices in the stores were acceptable."
"Staff were great, hotel was great but the visit to the Park was stressful due to overcrowding, wait times and many attractions being closed."
Overcrowded ‚Ä¶the queues for some of the attractions are over 2 hours . No matter which attraction you choose the waiting time is at least 1 hour. it does not worth the money .Never ever again. Waste of time and money.
"I have visited nearly all the Disney parks, and unfortunately, Disneyland Paris ranks lowest on my list. My family and I went there during Christmas, hoping for a ""magical"" experience filled with holiday cheer, but instead, we encountered poor service that soured our visit. The cast members in other Disney parks have always been lovely and charismatic, so I had high expectations for Disneyland Paris. However, the cast members here rarely smiled and often displayed unfriendly attitudes.At Pizzeria Bella Notte, the cashier seemed annoyed that we ordered the menu deal first instead of √† la carte, as though we were supposed to know the sequence that would make her job easier. Her attitude was off-putting and frankly gave me the ick. If entering orders is challenging, perhaps some training would help, rather than blaming the customers.Later, we had dinner at the Royal Pub, which was one of the worst service experiences I‚Äôve ever had at any Disney park. Our waiter ignored us, even after I repeatedly asked for tap water. Meanwhile, he promptly attended to the family sitting next to us, taking their order without hesitation. When I finally managed to get his attention again and reminded him I had already asked for water twice, he insisted I had asked for ice instead. Instead of apologizing for neglecting us, he gaslit us and continuously interrupted me, which was both unprofessional and infuriating.I was appalled by the cast members' lack of hospitality. Disneyland Paris would benefit from implementing better training programs to improve their staff's customer service and ensure the ""magic"" Disney is known for is consistently delivered."
"We stayed at the Disney Hotel for 2N/3D. The hotel is really beautiful, luxurious and conveniently located right at the entrance to the Disneyland. The service levels were a disappointment, it was not upto five star standard, We were there the nights before Christmas, the park was decorated in festival lights. The parade was awesome! They made efforts to spread the festive cheer in all shows and parades. The flip side was lot of crowd, long waiting times for rides and shows. We took Premier access which helped to gain quick entry with just few minutes waiting, it was worth the money.There are renovations going on in both Disneyland & Disney Studios. So could not experience all the shows and rides. Fortunately the weather was dry for most part of our stay."
It was magical!If you ever go to France you must visit disneyland paris!!Be aware though it will be expensive specially if you have children with you.
Disney has gone so far downhill - just do not go - no Xmas atmosphere. Disney staff not friendly - it's Xmas - for goodness sake Cheer up!!!!!   I know its France and gonna be lots of French people but the majority are just so rude!!!!
We booked this last minute and we absolutely loved it! Great to have some fun before returning home for Christmas
The tickets are sold out. NoWhere had chance to get if someone are traveled feom far far away and spent quite lot for fly/stay etc.
"It really is magical, we had a fantastic time, the park is very busy but why wouldn‚Äôt it be it‚Äôs DisneyLand. You really need premier passes as the wait times were around 60 minutes, with the premier passes we were on most rides in 5-10 minutes at the most. Some people have said you can do it all in a day which is nonsense, we didn‚Äôt do it all in 2 full 10hr days and we never stopped going from ride to ride.Lion King show was amazing, Together Pixar musical adventure with live orchestra needs to be seen to believe how great it was.Pirates of the Caribbean, Buzz lightyear Laser blast, Avengers Web were all super rides as were many others. Parade and drone show was visually spectacular. The only small thing I do believe the park could look at is the price of food, the ticket prices are high for the park already without food costing so much. Overall our family of 4 had an amazing time and hope to return soon."
"Disneyland Paris stands out for its quieter atmosphere compared to other Disney parks, which we appreciated. It is likely the most peaceful among them all, offering a less crowded and more relaxed experience. However, the rides felt less thrilling compared to those in other Disney parks.What significantly detracted from our visit was the prevalence of smoking, including among cast members who smoked in open-air resting areas. This greatly affects visitors seated nearby, who are forced to breathe in secondhand smoke. It is disappointing that Disney has not taken a firmer stance on managing smoking within the park.Considering that the park caters primarily to families and children, this oversight is particularly concerning. Secondhand smoke poses health risks, especially to young children, and goes against the wholesome family environment Disney strives to provide.We strongly urge Disneyland Paris management to address this issue by enforcing stricter smoking policies or relocating designated smoking areas far from where families gather. With so many children around, their health and well-being should be a top priority."
"Quite disappointing after visiting Disneyland in LA.  Too many rides that were just themed roller coasters rather than an experience related to the theme , a good example is the Indiana Jones ride which is a great ride in LA but just a roller coaster in Paris.  The Disney Studios Park was really sparse and not many rides.  One day was more than enough time here."
"Having visited Disneyland Paris back in May my girlfriend and I wanted to experience it at Christmas.This is a once and done for us, too busy, some of the staff quite rude this time and the food was average at best.Firstly the grounds and hotels, always kept clean, tidy, well presented and looking great. Part of the reason for the return was to do some of the rides which were closed on our previous trip and tindinthebOarisnChrietmss Market.Some managed to do all the rides we planned and wanted and they were as good as expected and as we remembered.Webslingers - very entertaining, fun and interactiveFlight Force - Superb, a re-themed rock'n'rollercoaster which never fails to deliveryToy Story Parachute drop - Not bad, good fun and very minimal in the intensity (looks worse than it is)Crushes Coaster - Awesome, very well presented and themed and prob quite high on the intensity for a family coaster, very good rideStar Wars Hyperspace Mountain - superb ride and better than the Florida Space mountain by farBig Thunder Mountain - Amazing, far superior to any other BTM we have ridden at other Disney parks Phantom Manor - I feel this is more true to the movies than the Florida Haunted Mansion and is a very good rideIndiana Jones Cosster - Another great addition which is very well themed and very funPirates of the Caribbean - Great but I cannot decide between this and the Florida one, I think Florida's or better tbh but this has an extra drop which is coolNow the tower of Terror... Wow this never fails to deliver, randomised drip sequences and superb theming this is a classic. We only ride it twice and both at night as it's much better then and its superb, although slightly shorter overall as it doesn't have the building swap like in Florida (this is the same setup as California), this however is imo more intense than Florida's version and is a must ride for anyone.Now the food. This is where Paris fails drastically.Firstly food options lacking, secondly seating, too many inconsiderate people sitting in food location on their phones without food and never ordering any or reserving tables when others need them as they have food. Annoyingly the staff  do nothing about this.When we ordered from Casey's corner we asked for the food in a bag to go, when we collected it was on a tray and when asked for it to be bagged the guy said should have when ordering. I did tell his we did and it was on the receipt if he'd have bothered to read it.Then the snacks, tasteless, bland and sickly at times with only a few exceptions. The Christmas gingerbread Micky was the best, soft, not over powering and very nice.The Chocolate Christmas tree - very nice and better than expected with a nice hint of hazelnut but possibly too much fake vanilla flavouring.The pistachio Boba Fett - Dry, bland, sickly and very disappointing (especially as he is my fav char) Chip and Dale cookie very cool looking but overall disappointing with next to no taste at all.Overall the trip was very good, we liked the decorations ones but it was very overcrowded, many rude people around and that was even more apparent when the parades and evening shows were on as people think it's fine to just push in trying to move you to take the spot you're in, or keep moving in front of you blocking views.Crowd control at Disneyland Paris is appealing and needs a lot of work as it's far less controlled than other Disney parks we have visited."
"I‚Äôm disappointed with Disney Land as We were refused access with no customer service assistance to rectify the situation.We purchased passes for two visits to Disney land, the first pass was excepted and we had a wonderful day in Disney land. The second pass we decided to execute two days later only to be told the tickets were for consecutive days, there was no second date or the word consecutive on the tickets or website, Disney land tried to say its customer error they was unable to prove and when challenged to indicate the documentation information they was unable to produce any tangible documentation evidence but still refused entrance to the park. Customer service is poor at the ticket sales office with little or no help other than pay twice although we had proven a valid ticket or at worst floors between the park and their ticket providers.In my view due to evidence submitted the park should have had a duty of care to ensure the tickets were fit for purpose. In short their customer service was as much help as a hand brake on a canoe.If visiting Disney land please ensure all the dates of your visit are printed on your tickets to avoid disappointment like we endured.Please"
"We visited on 17/18th December and stayed in Santa Fe. After seeing Halloween, I wanted to come back for the Disney Christmas Magic and I really enjoyed it! The decorations were fab and the theming as always was brilliant. Really enjoyed the Christmas parade and the Princesses. Yes it was busy, but we already expected that and we didnt really queue more than 20mins for a ride. Tried some of the themed Christmas snacks, were they amazing? No. But they were enjoyable and on par to expectations. Plenty of characters around to meet. After already going earlier on in the year, we knew what we wanted to do and see so it helped having a plan. Another good visit!"
"While I completely appreciate the fact that this is one of the most popular places to visit... the levels of overcrowding in the park really took away any magic that I was hoping for during my recent visit. I left with genuine safety concerns with the way in which crowds were being managed during particularly busy periods for parades and night-time shows. As someone who often tries to avoid the biggest of the crowds, this was simply impossible to do without PAYING for it. Overall, the park is beautifully presented and all cast members do their best to provide exceptional customer service, but this isn't always the easiest when the stream of customers is endless. There are also some areas that are in desperate need of cleaning and maintenance. I was shocked to see how dirty the dumbo ride was, with many of the effects switched off or rusting. During the visit, there were also some technical issues that were letting the park down. Another area that needs improvement is directional signage. Good luck trying to find your way round if you're not ready to explore and hope for the best that you stumble across something you were looking for. This is particularly true at night where many areas are essentially left in complete darkness due to lights not being on, or turned very low. The characters and interactions, most of the attractions and the overall vibes are still magical - the park is completely let down by the way in which you are basically funnelled into a very crowded central plaza even if you're not wanting to watch the parades. We got stuck at the side, essentially pushed against a railing while cast members told us to 'get off the road' during the parade. We had nowhere to move to and as more people began to push past, it felt really unsafe. There needs to be a specific route set for anyone wishing to bypass this area, and staff need to do better to manage crowds and move people safely rather than just assuming everyone is there for the parade. The same is true at night as the plaza fills up 2 hours before the fireworks start. We arrived in plenty of time, and did not see a single cast member trying to manage the crowds, other than those that were telling us that certain routes had now closed, unless you had paid for the reserved areas. Lack of signage, lack of direction and lack of crowd management took away all the magic I was hoping to feel. It just felt far too busy at all times."
"We usually go to WDW every year but this year opted for Disneyland Paris for the first time.Postives: Only 1 hour to get there... Park is very nice looking... Mine Train, Space mountain and Phantom Manor better than Orlando version...Gifts seem cheaper than OrlandoNegatives: Smokers everywhere, and i mean everywhere. Staff not interested. Not really any Disney magic, more of just another theme park.   Alot smaller and of course, the weather. Homeless beggar on the entrance of the park, and people wandering around the entrance asking to buy your tickets,Overall, I am glad i went so I can say i have been there, but if they had built this park in a better climate ( Spain maybe ) and they were STRICT on the Smokers, it would be a regular place i would go to. ( Our clothes stank of smoke at the end of the day)"
"Please remember our views below are just that, solely mine and my wife's alone. You may go and have the time of your lives and we hope you do. We are just reviewing from our PoV being huge Disney fans (mainly my wife!) and visited both USA and France parks many times now.Lets start with the package booked and hotelWe booked for the 2x of us for a 4x nights / 5x day stay. We stayed at the Sant√© Fe hotel, the cheapest on site budget hotel. We have stayed there before and liked it, it does the job. We planned to go as it was my wife's birthday, for her big one next year we are going back over to WDW Florida, but we felt we needed a quick Disney fix, a Christmas Disney fix this year. We also booked the half board meal plan and photo pass. We done this a good few months ago and pre booked all the restaurants we wanted to eat at etc at the time of booking. Highly recommended you to do this too. You will not get a seat anywhere on the day, so please avoid this disappointment. Now the cost for this 'mini' Disney fix.....just very shy of GBP 2,000 with the half board meal plan, park tickets, photo pass and birthday treat cake for my wife on her birthday. That is not including the LeShuttle train which came in at around GBP 150 -200.00 depending on time of travel, car size etc. Now in comparison, with the WDW Florida holiday we have booked for next year staying at All Star Movies, with meal plan, tickets, premium flights and photo pass included for 14 days it is GBP 7,000, you can see how relatively expensive DLP is and therefore what you would expect and want for the price you are paying. Now don't get us wrong, we will pay the money, but we expect the service and experience, the Disney experienceSo we rock up to the Sant√© Fe around 1400 hrs after good LeShuttle crossing and drive down. A very easy drive to from Calais, its about 3.5 hours. Roads are good, mainly two roads and that's it. It will cost you about 25 Euros in toll but you can use a debit/credit card for this, so don't worry about being cashless. We knew we would likely be too early for the room, but we wanted to get the photo pass voucher from reception so we could get some ride photos that afternoon. If we didn't want the photo pass that afternoon we could have gone straight to the parks (after parking the car at the hotel) and used our magic passes on the DLP App. Everything you booked beforehand and during your stay is kept on the app. I'll digress a little here sorry. The app overall is very good. But it stutters a lot, loses connection to the Wi-Fi and even mobile data if you have that switched on. Always at the most inconvenient time too. Also, so many people through the parks just gawp at their phones whilst walking aimlessly about, its endless dodgems in the park and combine that when its very busy and you will not walk a straight line longer than 20 metres! Oh and also do not expect an apology or excuse me from anyone if they bump you or block you etc. Its a European thing i think, no one cares at all. Just me, me, me. Anyway back to Sant√© Fe. The gent we spoke to at reception, nice guy told us that our room was not ready and that they will text us (checked my number with me) when the room is ready. Gave us a card key and said as soon as you have your text you can go straight there as your key will be activated. Will point out to you now that the key states 'Magic Pass' on it AND the reception guy said we could use this card in conjunction with the app. Handy that then if the app doesn't work at a time when you really need it to. we headed in to the parks. Come 1700 hrs, still no text. So by then after the travel day and the missus getting me on Tower of Terror as our first ride (blooming thing!), we headed back to reception. We saw a different guy this time. Again nice chap. We explained we still hadn't got our room number yet. He looked at his screen and said ''i am sorry your room wont be ready til 11pm'' then he smiled and said only kidding and am sorry that you didn't get your text, lets sort this out for you. My kind of guy with my kind of humour bless him. Now we did request a room on the ground floor close to reception and the La Cantina restaurant. Well they did exactly that for us, ground floor in the Sally building. Bang opposite the restaurant and reception, we even ended up parking the car right next door to the building, literally 20 secs from car to room, brilliant. We gave them our thanks and headed to the room. So Sant√© Fe is Cars themed. Rooms are themed nicely, but once again could do with a new refresh and refurb. Think they were just refurbed or freshened up after our last visit a few years back. But its still very clean and tidy. Room serviced daily too. They even left the trolleys out if you needed to grab some extra towels at anytime. The beds, oh my, they were divine. Some might find them too firm, but we thought they were just right and had good nights sleep even from the first night. The biggest let done of the room, the bathroom. Especially the shower. My word. I could dribble faster, the temperature control is none existent, so be prepared to go from scalding hot to ice cold in a matter of milliseconds. The shower curtain is of the flat variety, so if you are even the slightest bit bigger than an Oom-pah Loompa expect to be fighting a clinging war with the curtain. The plug mechanism didn't work in ours either, at all. I had to dismantle the thing so we could take a shower. The cleaners put it back when they cleaned through that morning, so when i had to dismantle it again the next morning.....we hid it! ;). So yes the rooms could do with a bit of a refresh and certainly a bit of plumbing maintenance. We had breakfast at the hotel each day apart from one day we did the character breakfast in the Plaza Gardens. The hotel breakfasts were fine, usual buffet type, plenty of choice and all fresh. The rolls are very crispy though, so go careful and perhaps avoid if you have a delicate palate or false nashers. We also had dinner in there a few times (on the half board plan). This is where we found issue with the 'Magic Pass' door key. It doesn't do anything but open the door apparently! That's what we were informed getting to the front of the dinner queue to check in. So traipsed back to room (luckily not that far away) to retrieve me phone. I left it behind just that time to have a blooming rest from it you know, thinking, as i was told and as it states on the card 'Magic Pass'. Also another dinner tip. Take some of your own drink with you. You only get one free soda each, once you've drunk that you cant refill it. It uses some fancy chip on the bottom of the mug. So they can use fancy chips on the bottom of the drinks mugs, but cant activate a room key to do anything else than open the door......even though the key says 'Magic Pass' and i was told it was usable for all the other things too. I am not over this yet am i??lolBuses to the park your usual fayre. every 12 or so minutes and its literally a 5 minute journey (if that) to or from the hotel. Expect to be bundled out the way by most as they vie for seats, but don't worry about all that nonsense, as long as you get on it, its only a five minute stand topsSecuritySo you now have to go through security checks before heading to either park. This can get extremely busy. Once again the staff are not very helpful at all.........sorry to say it again, if you speak English, expect more nonsense than other languages might suffer. One time through i was accused of carrying a knife in my bag! I offered to move out the way, over to the usual table where you would empty bag contents and empty my bag for them to search through properly, like a decent and proper security guard team should. Nope they (all 3x of them) continued (and wanted to continue) making a big fuss, holding up the line and machine, still accusing me of carrying a knife, but without actually allowing me to empty my bag to show them otherwise. You know what it was they saw on the x-ray machine? My credit card holder.  Didn't get any form of an apology or thank you have a good day, nothing. Embarrassing. For them not me tbh. Walt Disney Studios Park (the name for now)Basically, its shut! lol. Its not by the way, but it might as well be with the amount of refurb and construction going on. Instead of doing this and that bit by bit as they do in the States, they have decided, in their infinite wisdom here, to rip the whole park apart and refurb it all at once. Maybe a good idea, maybe not? But at present it resembles a building site more than anything else. Still nice and tidy as always. Very crowded though, even more so when you are being bottle necked into walkways surrounded by scrim. So yea its an alright park, that if you wanted to, at the mo you could complete in half a day. Tower of Terror just a classic as well as Ratatouille. One or two new rides in Avengers. The biggest disappointment is the Cars Road Trip ride. Just the Backlot Tour ride with the name Cars Road Trip stuck on the front of it, with blu-tak. Where's the Disney Imagineering with that?? Had the chance to really zazz that ride up. Gone for the idea of the Cars land in California, but no just a name rehash. Very disappointing. Cars not seen as woke enough these days i suppose to grant it any more than a name change rehash. some good food and snack stalls if you can get anywhere near close to any of them. Majority of the restrooms, if not all, extremely clean and tidy. Warning for the ladies though, unfortunately you still may have to queue for yours. Awful really, we put men on the moon almost 60 years ago, but still in 2024 ladies still have to queue for toilet space! Its the same in both parks by the way. Us lads though no problem though, no queues seen at all. Will say to the gents though, again this is for both parks, some of the toilets do not have many cubicles, so if like me you prefer a cubical......whatever your intentions, please be aware of thatMagic Kingdom (Disneyland Park)Looks beautiful in its Christmas fayre and d√©cor, it really does. But it just lacks the magic, the Disney experience, the bubble you know. If you have been to Disney in the states you know what i mean. A few years back when we last visited DLP it started to feel that it had. I think Disney had just come back in to it. They had previously sold their shares in it, for it to dive in to the depths of its despair. Well it seems to be slowly sinking towards that despair again. Ok Disney has always been about the money, BUT it still gave you that escapism, that running from the real horrid world, even just for a few days to escape, go back to that child like state, that comfort that we all love, even if many of us cant or wont admit it. But with DLP that's all it seems to be about. Money, rides and shows and how much they can make for it. Will get on to the Premier Access stuff shortly. But they just don't care for the personable service there they really don't. Its someone's birthday, throw a badge at them (once they have shown the date on their passport of course, can't have anyone walking around in a 50p badge saying its my birthday if its not, crime of the century that. But why not to be honest? They don't do anything special anyway for that person. Each and every staff member at WDW wished me a happy birthday when i was there celebrating, i even got some pixie dust treats. Nowt big, but say place you in the front row on a ride, or a fast pass on a ride to save queuing, but it felt special. When my wife and i had our honeymoon many moons ago in WDW we were given honeymoon badges and was treated like royalty. Everyone stopped to say congrats, we got asked to open the theatre doors to shows, our own ride vehicle on certain rides. It was amazing. DLP, they couldn't give a monkeys at all. Might as well have just stayed at Centre Parks or Alton Towers. No disrespect meant to either of these venues by the way, its just Disney should be different and run properly it is different than the rest. Again back on track, MK was also very clean and tidy. Very crowded. Some would arguably say that DLP may well not have a capacity limit it was that busy. Parade was nice, but very short and the same parade happens twice a day so they can get the floats back to the original position. Again where's the magic in that?? Plenty of room guys, reconstruct your behind the scenes better! Or make it one big parade and ferry the floats back after the park has closed. Still a beautiful looking park i will say that and do like the fact you can walk through and around the castle, room permitting of courseWalt's RestaurantWe booked this experience on our half board meal plan. It was one of the best experiences of my life and the best three course meal i have ever had. We had seats at the window over looking Main Street and we were there to watch the early daylight Christmas parade pass by. One lady that did know the Disney experience was our server a young lady called Clara. She was just the best, a credit to Disneyland Paris. The only downside, was yet again someone else that could not control their children. had one of them leaning across me food at one point! It could not diminish though what a fantastic meal and experience it was. Personally, do not think children under 12 should be allowed in there, there has to be somewhere for us adults just to enjoy the magic in peace, if only for a couple of hours. It is also adult themed in there, nowt to interest the kiddo's, so just give it to us!lol Biggest tip though if you fancy eating there, please book in advance like we did you will not get in on the day, or even trying to book a few days ahead, i think you will be disappointedUltimate Access - Gives you ONE ride on all rides named on the app which is the majority of the rides in both parks. This access is for both parks and has to be used in one day, not over the course of your stay. Its from 90 Euros each (child or adult), but it never is that price. We paid 120 Euros each for ours, 240 Euros total. We did it on the Friday as we thought being a weekday would be slightly quieterOne Access - Basically you can pay for this for one particular ride at a time on the day you are in the park. Prices from 5 Euros each a ride (child or adult).... yea right!Ultimate Access Experience (UA)Ok then. Take a free to use Fast Pass system used many years ago up until very recently and successfully. Now take that service, give it a fancy name at each ride 'Premier Access' charge people even more than a daily park ticket to be able to get on the rides quicker without queueing or a very short queue at most. Shall we let them have unlimited rides for that money?  No. Ok then shall we redesign the old Fast Pass queue layout so we can get the Premier Access customers to the start of the ride quicker? No. So then what we are saying here is we are going to use a once free service, that worked and make no changes to the queue layout and charge high end fees to place people half way down a queue, still to wait 20 plus minutes? Yep, that'll do!Now please don't get me wrong here, i know its an add on, not a compulsory service and you pay your money you make the choice. But if you are not going to improve the once free Fast Pass service at all, then don't charge the money you are charging. Some people like us, many if not all people are only at DLP for a few days and some would like to try and get on all the rides that they can and are willing to pay for that service. But don't rip people off and that's why it is a rip off. An answer to this would be for the UA to last for the duration of your stay, that would be more fair and look affordable. I mean even though there is only technically one and a half parks open at this time due to the refurb works, i challenge anyone to get all the available rides on the UA done within the day. It would be nigh on impossible. Some of the PA lanes at some rides where as long as the normal lines itself, Thunder Mountain springs to mind thereOne Access (OA)The following day we thought we might try this on a coupe of rides we didn't get to go on yet (yep even after a day of PA at 120 nicker each!) At 'from' 5 Euros a ride it didn't seem too bad.......ok. So cheapest ride was Phantom Manor at 7 Euros. Ok not too bad we thought. Only for it to breakdown literally as we were about to go through the door. You can wait and use the OA on the ride later when its fixed, but fixing time not guaranteed. So you could go use it on any other ride ''Any other ride'' as muted by the queue attendant at PM. Well Thunder Mountain be the closest one we will try there. But then told by the TM queue attendant, ''no the ride you go on must be an equivalent OA price as the one that broke down'' fair enough we thought but looking through the list we didn't really want to go on any of them. So we thought as we are here at TM and the actual queue time stated 65 mins (it never is that time by the way, here in Paris they seem to be longer than stated, total opposite to WDW which always seem to be less, strange) we thought lets book a OA pass for TM whilst we are here, on we go to the app, TM 16 Euros EACH!! 16 Euros!! I just laughed, i had nothing else left. So in conclusion are the UA and OA worth it? UA - well all depends if you've got the fitness (and inclination) to do two parks all in one hit in the one day, how many rides you really want to get done and of course the crowding of the parks and not wanting to see any shows or parades. OA - Avoid like the plague, unless you are really really desperate to ride a two minute ride, still queue for likely 20 plus minutes at least and loose upwards of 30 Euros, more if you are a family that want to ride, remember the price is EACH, man, woman, child or beast!Genie and Genie Plus crashed and burned in the States when people said enough was enough, i can see this happening with both the UA and OA too unless the pricing is drastically overhauled, or the Premier Access queue line lanes are redesigned Character Breakfast - Plaza GardensGreat experience. Our characters were Donald, Daisy, Goofy, Pluto, Tigger and Eeyore. They were all very attentive and great interacting with us all. Had time for everyone and hung around for the whole hour. Breakfast buffet was good too as expected with the usual food on offerBirthday cake treatThis was ordered when we booked the break back in the summer of this year. each time we booked in for dinner we were asked if we wanted the treat. No not this time thanks we are waiting for the actual day. Then the night we wanted it the system at the restaurant went haywire and showed we hadn't ordered it. I then tried to show the details on the app, but yep you guessed it, the app wouldn't work due to connection issues. Manager called in to try and sort it, the English language seemed to become more and more difficult, funny how it was all going smoothly until a glitch in the works. 20 minutes later with my wife getting more embarrassed and upset by the minute i just asked to forget the birthday cake we will just get it refunded after our stay. even then i still had to show the Magic Pass on my app that still wouldn't connect up. Had to wander down the corridor until it fired up again. All quite embarrassing and unnecessary. But at the end of all that, no apology, no thank you for our patience and please have a happy birthday, absolute jot all. In conclusion i am really sorry in saying that, I do not think it will ever change at DLP to be a consistent great addition to the the Disney world of parks. It looks great yes but lacks any substance whatsoever, apart from the odd event or staff member. But it just not do enough i am truly sorry to say. Save your money, head to Florida or LA instead. It was certainly our last visit to DLP"
"Sorry to say but for me disney did not live up to the hype.  Way too many people allowed in, making queues for food and rides ridiculous,  even with early access with magic pass. Food was ridiculously priced and poor quality. The rainforest cafe all the food was served cold. The food from the bakery was stale. The only semi decent food was in the Stark restaurant and even that wasn't great.  Shops all sold the same things and the selection inside was very limited. Hardly any characters wandering about. We did a character breakfast and they characters would disappear if you didn't get your camera out fast enough meaning we hardly got any photos with them , it was all very rushed. Although the food was OK. Main street was beautiful,  lovely decorations and very christmasy,  but no Christmas anywhere else in either parks. I was expecting more themeing around the park, but there was hardly any and it just felt like any other theme park, not the magical once in a lifetime disney experience people rave about. The parade was fantastic tho, really good ( get a spot near its a small world, it's was less crowded that end!). Didn't see the fireworks as they don't start until 10pm and my kids were exhausted by then. The rides are OK, but nothing amazing,  no better than a fairground in some instances, and some are just plain odd ( snow white!). The shows are very good but extremely loud. We stayed in the hotel ( done a separate review) for 3 nights and had 3 days in the parks. Lots of people seemingly more interested in getting a photo of themselves than enjoying the rides! And so crowded as to make the whole thing unenjoyable.  Toilets were clean and plentiful at least. Staff very efficient but not friendly really. It certainly wasn't magical and I wouldn't go back. But my kids did have a good time so there's that. Unless your a total disney nut I wouldn't bother!"
"Disneyland Paris was pure magic! The mix of Disney charm and European style made it so unique. The castle was stunning, and the rides were just as fun as in the U.S. parks. The parades and shows were amazing too. It‚Äôs a dream come true for any Disney fan!"
"We stayed at The DP Hotel this December for 3 nights and had a great experience. The staff were friendly and very helpful, the room was clean and neat, and as it is open 24 hours we could come and go as we pleased. Highly recommended by us."
"Always the best place on earth! Performance was great, food options was great. Had lots of fun there with the family. Will be back"
"A fun set of parks to visit. First foreign Disney park and decidedly different from the US versions. While smaller than the Florida parks, there was still plenty to do. December has the Christmas theming, with most characters in their Christmas outfits. Lines were not too long, but having the extra magic hour before park opening when you stay on Disney property makes it easy to ride the popular rides first."
"Great to visit anytime,We found the train the best way to visit,Two parks two days seems the right amount of time,Lines can be long on some rides,Recommend going short line rides a few times than wasting a hour for one.Firework display at night  brillant"
"I celebrated my birthday at Disneyland Paris, and it was an unforgettable experience! I enjoyed the rides, especially the Finding Nemo roller coaster, which was a thrilling adventure. Although Disneyland can be a bit pricey, the overall experience was worth it. One downside was the long wait times to take pictures with Mickey and the Disney princesses, which were around 2 hours due to the crowds. However, the night show made up for it, with an incredible display of music and lights that truly captured the magic of Disney. Overall, it was a fantastic birthday celebration filled with fun and excitement!"
"Awful. Been 3 hours and not been on a ride. Queues massive and not suitable for young children who need toilets and are cold. Overrated,over priced and far too busy, 50 minute queues everywhere.  More entertainment in a shopping mall with free entry. Caught fleeting glimpse of one character who ran away .,.no fun at all. Total waste of time and money. Rip off"
"Pros- park looks fab, really well designed and decorated Rides really goodParade really goodCharacters really great with children Cons- a huge issue is the amount of people smoking , there are smoking zones but people smoke all over and the staff do nothing The amount of work going on, major construction site at Disney village and at the studios is disappointing, really ruins the magic, they should do one at a time, there was also numerous barriers up in the park"
"We had the best time at DisneyLand. The parades, the rides, the characters, everything was awesome and my 6 year old niece loved it.They were also really accommodating to disabilities which made the day so much easier."
"This trip was really good, I was really surprised about the connection in the park and the service points, it worked really well. the rides and food was also really good and i loved the variety of rides."
"Disneyland Paris was pure magic! The castles and streets felt like a fairy tale, and the rides were bellissimo‚ÄîSpace Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean were my favorites. The food was delicious, though I did miss a proper espresso! The parades and shows were incredible, and the whole place was so well-organized. Perfect for Disney lovers or anyone wanting to feel like a kid again. Fantastico!"
We've waited all year to experience this holiday. And taking my young 3 children on they're very first trip abroad. We are staying in the Newport bay club and staff in the hotel have been lovely. Room is lovely and clean plenty of space etc. Bit of a que for some rides but that's fine and was expected. My issue is if you are coming here with young children don't expect some of the security guards to be helpful. I've had the most awful experience tonight and the attitude and professionalism of the 2 security guards I had the pleasure of bumping into has left me so angry. Infuriated and sent me absolutely crazy. We had left the park after a fabulous fireworks display myself 3 children (one in a pram) amd the rest of my family. It was heaving took us a while to exit. Myself and the baby in the pram got stuck in the crowd and my other 2 went ahead of me. I was stuck in the line as we all were like a heard of cows and I accidentally turned at the wrong exit quickly realised what I did at the gate and turned around quickly to catch up with my other 2 children who are 7 and 8. I was stopped by 2 security men who started shouting at ne that I'd have to leave and go in a direction I was unfamiliar with. I explained I needed to get my children and pointed at where they were heading which was just past Annette's dinner they said I had to go that way. I again told them my children are potentially on they're own I need to go to them they told me tough and that they didn't care and were pointing at where I should go. I got so anxious and upsett by this point I was trying to phone my other family members but couldn't get through I then started shouting out of fear they were so horrible and nasty. The whole thing was totally unbelievable. There I am standing there telling them my 2 young children are potentially on they're own and 2 security guards who are payed to assist and take care of paying customers of the park just didn't give a s##t.  I don't know how many times I tried to explain what had happened but they wouldn't listen.. I had no choice in the end but to scream the place down and only then they allowed me to go in  after causing such a scene. I got through to my dad eventually and thankfully told me my other 2 children were with my mum. My dad came down to meet me because I was so in shock and upset. He went to ask the 2 security guards for badge numbers one was very confrontational with him and pushed his upper body into him to show his badge. Got back to the hotel to make a complaint and found out they had lied to cover they're tracks and said I was trying to enter the disney village when that wasn't really the case so just shows they didn't listen to a word I said. Absolutely disgusting behaviour from 2 individuals who's duty of care basically is there to protect the guests but they couldn't give 2 hoots that a 7 and 8 year old could have been wondering the place on they're own. Them laughing at me when I was clearly upset says it all.
"Avoid this park. Prices are disgusting. Costing nearly 3pound for a bottle of coke also 16pound for a burger meal. The airport staff fobbed us off every chance they got and directed us to the wrong places resulting in us missing our train, which may I add are not as priced as online but 4 to 5 euros more. Costing us double for another ticket. We were given a room that was currently being occupied,walking in on another guest in there own room. And then the cost of snacks and merchandise etc which nothing was under 4 euros you can easily spend a couple of grand here if you are a family of four, Its all a big money grabbing scam. The happiest place on earth ,yeah If your financially able to or it ruins everything"
"Disappointed by the lack of festive decorations and also by the number of rides and areas closed due to renovations. Appreciate work needs to be done but you buy your full price tickets and don‚Äôt get full use. Main Disney park had more open than the Hollywood Studio park! Stayed at Sequoia lodge got a nice view, rough loo roll and rough paper thin towels. Supplied with lamp, coffee machine and kettle with only one plug socket."
Rides breaking down left and right Rudest staff ever. Overpriced and poor quality of souvenirs/clothes. Fix the problems or lower the prices.
"Spent a full day, well 5 hours navigating the many different rides and attractions, lots of things to see and do, maybe more lights and night, some places difficult to see, plenty of places to eat, toilets when you could find them, signs would help, but we still had a good time, cold and damp weather didn‚Äôt stop us and waiting time for rides was fine, us adults loved it!!!"
"Worst Disneyland so far (I‚Äôve been to the parks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and California). We left this place devastated and frustrated from our experience. We were treated so badly because we were Malaysian Indians and didn‚Äôt look French of course . Most of the staffs were rude to us (especially Casey‚Äôs corner, the waiter was Indian and assumed we were from India, started arguing with us, pushed us back ) . Some kind of racism going on around here . Some rides had technical issues while riding it. Kept stopping and restarting back. Rests of the guests were also rude to us, one man pushed us and his lady showed the middle finger to us. We were shocked to see this kind of attitude. There was also a point when a mother quickly pulled her child away when she passed by us. It‚Äôs not like we were gonna kidnap her child! The worst part was when we returned to the train station to board the train back to our hotel, we were targets of a pickpocket attempt at Marne La Vall√©e Chessy station. The pickpocket took my mom‚Äôs purse and to her dismay there was no cash/credit card inside (we have kept it elsewhere) , so the pickpocket threw away the purse and left the train. Honestly, we didn‚Äôt feel safe at all. Not even at Disneyland. We will not be returning to Paris ever. No one treats us well , always rude to us, and has some kind of stereotype about Indians. It was a mistake thinking Paris Disneyland would be a happy place! Regret our decision visiting this place filled with racism."
"Disneyland Paris is a nice place with good rides and fun parks with nice themes, and best of all the two parks are next to each other. But you mostly get good service if you speak french. They‚Äôre horrible at english - even though Disneyland Paris has existed since 1992. Everything is mostly in french (rides, shows and signs) and their merchandise is in french. There is no guest service in the park like in all parks in Disney World, so you‚Äôre on your own most of the time."
"I would strongly recommend a visit at Christmastime.  Despite it being colder, it was totally worth it and we just wrapped up.  Don't miss the shows, they are incredible!"
Absolutely shocking. Nothing there is edible service is terrible. The restaurant staff are dam rude. No Supermarch√©s in the resort or surrounding areas unless you drive so forced to pay extortionate prices for garbage microwave food. Just go your local theme park and save your money. Plus it‚Äôs that busy your like sheep in a pen
Loved it! So did my kids! Rides were very fun but food wasn‚Äôt very good. I think they could‚Äôve put the lands in better areas as it felt like stuff was randomly next to eachother.
"Good but if you‚Äôve done or planning to do America Disney‚Ä¶ save your money for that! Needs more rides, not as big as advertised and lots or regenerations happening currently. Was half term when we went so busy as you‚Äôd expect but queue jumping not worth the cost imo.Enjoyed the drone display but fireworks were poor.Shops and food expensive but the food was good! Everything comfortably done in 3 days."
Definitely need to check this Disneyland out- we had just a one day ticket luckily the snow had settled but it was still cold and luckily not as crowded as I know Disneyland can be. Different experience with cold and snow but the highlight was the Ratatouille ride-meal and the associated food chalets with cheesy food if we hadn‚Äôt booked for dinner I would have definitely eaten there. the lion king show was really good singing and dancing and acrobatic acts.It was great to tick this  Disneyland off our list not one of the bigger ones but still worth seeing.
"We stayed on site for 3 nights & easily got everything done. Mid week in December. One night was very foggy and you couldn‚Äôt see the drone show and they cancelled the fireworks.The fast pass was very expensive, over ‚Ç¨20 per person on some rides. So we didn‚Äôt buy it. We didn‚Äôt do drop drop, but these are the rides to head to if you do. Or wait until late when the fireworks are about to start. Our longest queue of just over an hour was Peter Pan & Crush Coaster. Both good rides. Our must do was to buy a plastic keepsake glass of champagne. ‚Ç¨20 each, but lovely. Only buy on food cart at end of Main Street outside Gibson Girl. I did get to keep a cork too.Favourite ride is Thunder Mountain. Better and faster than Florida. We did it after dark and the lighting make it even more thrilling. Indiana Jones is a quick moving queue & the upside down loop wasn‚Äôt that bad.Everyday at least 1 main ride broke down. Space Mountain & Pinocchio were. Loved for refurb. There is lots of disruption due to building works. Food and alcohol is very expensive everywhere.Lots of shops with same stuff. We found the jewellery quite reasonably priced. I agree with an earlier review, too much LILO & Stitch stuff. The park was crowded and the parade route is short. Very good light parade. There was something in the afternoon but it wasn‚Äôt listed on the App? We just bumped into it at the main entrance. Mickey, Minnie & Santa at the station & Goofy & dancers in street. This was 2.30pm.The drone show is good but could be better. The fireworks are really sad compared to Florida and the music was unmemorable. A lot of stuff is in French. Star Tours was in French. Why can‚Äôt they also have rides in English like they do with some of the shows.The park & the hotels are all looking very tired. Dull paint work and scruffy pavements. Not magical at all. We  love Christmas, but felt there should have been more decorations in Studios and Disney village. I think the parks must look really sad when not decorated. Most of the queuing areas are outside. So you are out in the cold or heat, also not shade if it rains or is really sunny."
"Me and my partner came here for 5 nights and stayed in the Newport bay hotel this hotel was lovely the room was Clean and big, we had a few issues with the bath not really holding the water properly and house keeping not changing the bed unless reminded too but we quickly got this sorted by speaking to reception, the park it‚Äôs self was good aswell lots of shops for all the merch we found different things in the shops so not all the same stuff everywhere the only slight issue we had was the food quality obviously we know this is a Disney theme park and the food wouldn‚Äôt be cheap but that wasn‚Äôt the issue the quality was not great in cowboy cook out and pym kitchen, however Walt‚Äôs, plaza gardens and remys were great overall the park was busy however does get quieter in the mornings and evenings"
"I visited Disneyland Paris in December with my partner and two year old son. I have been to Paris a handful of times but i have been lucky enough to also experience Disney World in Florida. Disneyland is split into two parks -:Disneyland which is the equivalent to Magic Kingdom and is basically the same as the US one and the other park, which is next door, is Walt Disney Studios, similar to Disney MGM studios in Florida but smaller..This review is merely about Disneyland. Firstly, i stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and although expensive it was really worth the money due to the ease of access with it directly next to the entrance to the park. I prefer visiting Disneyland at Christmas time due to the generic atmosphere and the Christmas Spirit, from walking down Main Street seeing the snow falling down to the christmas parades that take place. Each morning at opening Mickey and Minnie stand on the balcony looking down at the guests and waving and we noticed this was every morning which was nice for the little ones. I will break the review down into the main Pro‚Äôs and cons -:Pro‚Äôs - The Atmosphere throughout the park, especially at Christmas, is amazing and well presented with the Christmas tree and decorations and the spirit of Christmas throughout the entire park from the music to the various different stalls and drinks servers scattered around. I often forgot about the struggles of life whilst enjoying myself throughout the park. The staff were friendly and accommodating and there were many about. I don‚Äôt think i had any staff member who was rude or gave a negative attitude and many were forthcoming to help you where needed.The shops were not too badly priced for presents such as toys and the prices i paid is something i would expect to pay even if back in England. I did think it would be considerably more considering where we were but it wasn‚Äôt too bad.Cons-:There is literally shops everywhere selling the same stuff, i think this could be cut down and maybe consider more rides or activities instead of the constant shop after shop.Ensure you get to the fireworks early (from 9pm i would reserve) as this can get very very busy with crowds and you often find yourself being pushed or barged. Also check the weather as we watched the fireworks/laser show when fog set in and the castle could not be seen at all to which most people left. This will save a wasted trip, also if there is wind or any sign of bad weather the drones will not be flown which can affect the electric show. Speaking of the electric show i wasn‚Äôt really fond of it and i personally feel it is not Disney enough, if that makes sense.Where are all the characters hiding? We literally saw the same characters in the same place every day such as Winnie the Pooh at the entrance, Balou by Adventure Land however there was no Mary Poppins, Buzz Lightyear or any other main character at all however i personally saw Chip and Dale so many times but i don‚Äôt think i even knew who they were until someone told me. I think times have changed now where children watch more modern disney programmes/movies so therefore more options would be better character wise rather than the same ones.Very busy which causes the queue times to be very long. Fastpass is also around ¬£9 per ride which you can only use once, the ‚Äúunlimited fastpass‚Äù also only allows you to go onto a ride only once and cannot be used numerous times so be careful of that. i love Christmas at Disney and as much as i have mentioned the cons i still cannot get over the happiness on my childs face when he see‚Äôs woody or the lights and for that i will continue to come each year however i think people need to realise that this is Disney, it is a business which is famous worldwide so therefore they need to expect some of the prices to be higher than expected."
"This was our 15th visit to Disneyland Paris and we've been really impressed. We decided to stay at the Disneyland Hotel to enjoy a special experience, and I've reviewed this separately.Disneyland Park itself is beautiful as always. Christmas decorations this year are even more magical than ever, plenty of colour and the periodic Main Street USA events are great to experience. I'd definitely say to everyone that you must visit Disneyland Paris just for how beautiful the park is and exhilarating the attractions are, while providing a wide variety of intensities around different theming to suit all individuals unlike no other theme park I've visited can.Food has massively improved across the park. We visited Walt's - an American Restaurant, Captain Jack's Restaurant des Pirates and a few fast food restaurants within the park. Food is now high-quality, flavourful and consistent across all the outlets we visited while actually being a reasonable price to what I'm used to in the UK (3 course fine dining meal is approximately 55 euros). Service in restaurants was good in some and inconsistent in others, but still the magic atmosphere remains.Disney Illuminations are spectacular and I'm hoping the new version coming next year lives up to expectations! The Magical Sky Parade was a lovely addition too. However, I was slightly disappointed that the VIP viewing area was quite large and unavailable for purchase during my visit despite staying at the Disneyland Hotel, meaning members of our party got quite tight into a zone with plenty of VIP space next to it just to get a good view while Disney Cast Members attempted to strictly enforce the no-entry rule which didn't really compliment the experience and would make some uncomfortable.Merchandise has also improved since our last visit, I'm pleased they have gone back to varied merchandise throughout different stores which makes shopping more exciting. Christmas merchandise was more restricted but I appreciate the beautiful designs, more baubles like usual please!Service has got slightly better but significantly better on attractions, queues being much more organised and controlled. Premier Access is still quite expensive but worth it.I was hesitating whether to add a 4 or 5 star rating, however, I decided on 5 due to the massive improvements and our families' desire to return very soon. I'd highly recommend to everyone and thank Disneyland Paris for making these valid improvements which fans have suggested!"
"People say Disney is meant to be ‚ÄòThe happiest place in earth‚Äô but sadly that wasn‚Äôt my experience.  The facilities at the park were great and the food and drinks, and as expensive as to be expected. The shows are also great, and the rides are fun. Sadly the aggressive nature of a lot of the other guests really spoils it. We took my MiL who is in a wheel chair, and honestly so many times she was banged into and pushed about as people rushed to get in front of her, particularly on the buses between the parks and the hotels. We missed several buses that we could have taken purely because of this. The attitude of others really ruined the experience for me and my family. I also thought the merchandise went really heavy on Lilo and Stitch at the expense of some older but brilliant characters missing"
"Having visited disneyland paris 5 times in the past we couldn't wait to return, although it had been 15 years since our last visit, we still had many magical memories from previous visits but what a disappointment it was when we got there!The park is now 30 years old and it's clearly showing its age, from broken pavements to 90% of the rides breaking down, etc.  They clearly need to spend money on fixing this park and not spending money on the new frozen park which is certainly not going to improve things.The waiting ques are atrocious, we were waiting about an hour for each ride, we don't remember it ever being this bad, then they want 16 euro to skip the que for peter pan, this is just ridiculous!Almost 90% of the rides we went on broke down, including thr rail road train and crushes coaster, which was the only one who gave us a fast pass as an apology!Some rides have changed and not for the better, such as the cars road trip which is just awful now, it was better before!The shops sell the same old merch as each other, you used to get different stuff in each shop/different parts of the park and the prices are ludicrous ¬£8 for a plastic pen, come on?!There was a lot of meet and greets with characters, which was definitely an improvement from previous visits and the disney app had its advantages, although it wasn't the most accurate and really needs updated, such as the list of places you can use your food pass at and upto date menus.We bought a food pass which was definitely worth the money as the prices were just shocking for what you actually got especially at our previous favourite, Annette's diner which was absolutely disgusting.The park has definitely changed in regards to health and safety, with seatbelts on many rides such as the carousel and other rides but these seatbelts hardly fit adults (I'm only a size 12 and I'm struggled, the staff waste time checking everyone's seatbelt and giving out extensions surely they could put an announcement out and make all seatbelts longer to save time and cut down ques?I lost count of how many times I tripped and witnessed people tripping up over the kerbs and broken pavements, this is definitely an issue that needs addressed and as for cleanliness, there was rubbish everywhere, visitors don't seem to care!The weather was cold and icy when we visted but yet not a bit of grit in sight, which made the paths so slippery.The parades have definitely improved from what I remember from previous visits and was definitely worth seeing and the illuminations were really good, probably the best thing we experienced.The security has been increased with  lots of security checks, such as bag searches, sniffer dogs, police, etc which isn't a bad thing!I could go on but there is many things that need to be addressed at disneyland, as I doubt we wouldn't return anytime soon.The magic definitely isn't there anymore and many things need fixed to bring the magic back."
"We found this visit really disappointing unfortunately, for a number of reasons.1. There were NO photo pass photographers anywhere! Isn‚Äôt that part of the experience? In LA they‚Äôre everywhere. 2. The characters were few and far between, and you had to queue for ages to meet them/get a photo etc. In LA they‚Äôre everywhere.3. Limited options for food without making a reservation. I understand amazing places book up months ahead but everywhere else seemed to close up early so if you were at the park late you had really limited options. 4. Nobody seemed to know where I could buy stamps to post the postcards I purchased from Disneyland. I was sent on a wild goose chase! Hot top if anyone else needs them - I had to go to the booth where they rent out prams to get them in the end ? 5. I have a small baby and I‚Äôm breastfeeding. It‚Äôs also freezing cold because it‚Äôs winter. There was nowhere I could find to sit down indoors to feed my baby. Apparently there is one room available for this somewhere, but I couldn‚Äôt find it. I went into a cafe to ask if I could sit down - the lady snapped at me telling me I could only sit down if I bought food. That was fine, but my baby was screaming. She could see we were both distressed. Then while my husband went to get our lunch, I asked a man who was seating people if I could sit down to feed my baby while my husband got our lunch. He told me off like I was a child and pointed to a sign that said you can‚Äôt sit until you‚Äôve bought food. It was absolutely humiliating. I get it, there‚Äôs rules, but in a place like Disney that‚Äôs supposed to be family friendly, it really didn‚Äôt feel it. 6. In the same restaurant, we observed an older gentleman in a wheelchair being wheeled out by his son. TWO waitstaff stood doing nothing and watched them struggle to get through the door! In the end another patron stood up from her meal to get the door for them. 7. Not a huge deal but those iconic badges that say if it‚Äôs your first visit, your birthday, etc were nowhere to be found. Apparently it‚Äôs something only hotel guests get? Not sure if it‚Äôs just in Paris or everywhere but disappointing all the same. In LA they were so kind and helpful. In Paris they just didn‚Äôt seem to care. They‚Äôve lost the ethos of what Disney is about. Very disappointing"
A lovely day out with.interesting place for children‚Äôs.Quite expensive but every penny worth for sure.will be back again
"3 weeks after my trip and I still have the Disney blues! I have wanted to go all my life and it did not disappoint, DLP is an AMAZING place! Everything from the theming of the hotels, restaurants and shops to the rides and characters was perfect! We visited during Christmas so it was incredible to see all the Christmas decorations, the drone show and the Christmas parade. It jump started our festive season and felt like magic. Obviously it is not cheap to go, or when you‚Äôre there, but it is Disneyland and is to be expected. We fell very lucky with the weather which made the whole trip even more enjoyable. The app was great too and really helped us organise our day and overall trip. I loved everything about it and can‚Äôt wait to go again one day!"
Really great time. Weather was snowing for the first day but cleared after that. Atmosphere was wonderful. Some areas were closed for refurbishment but it didn‚Äôt kill the atmosphere. We stayed in Newport Bay Hotel. Really recommend going at Christmas
"Overpriced, crowded, lack of information. Had to pay extra for anything good and most of rides were not available. Took my son for his birthday and he was very disappointed. Was a lot of money to spend on a very bad experience. Would nit recommend"
"First thing to make clear: Disneyland Paris is 2 connected parks, Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park. We only did the Disneyland Park. Visited on a hot summer day in July. As we rented a house in Esbly we were only 8 minutes away. We arrived before 10.00 and passing security and the entrance went smoothly. Then the wait started. You can see in the app and per attraction what the waiting time is. 1 - 2 hours of waiting is no exception. The park is nice and the attractions are great but waiting 2 hours for a 2 minute ride is not funny. We were with teenagers and focused on the rollercoasters but also did 'it's a small world', Alice's Curious Labyrinth, Autopia and the railroad. It was nice to sit for a while in a cool place during Mickey‚Äôs PhilharMagic. We have seen and experienced it and we don't think about it to come back. The hot temperature and long waiting lines aren't worth it. The price (we paid almost USD 80 per person with a Family and Friends ticket) is also not attractive to try it another time. Restaurants, food stands, and souvenir shops are also extremely expensive, but they think they can justify it because it's Disney. The crew we interacted with is also not friendly and looks stressed but what you imagine with these big crowds? When we wanted to fill our water bottles (they have some water fountains) a lady started shouting to us because it was the area for the disabled people to watch the parade. Way too much stress. We have seen it, it was a nice experience, but the long lines, high price and stressed crew doesn't attract us to come back."
"This is my 5th visit since 2017 and sad to say it's lost the appeal and magic it used to have. I usually receive an email from Disney asking for feedback but it's been a week since I've been back and got nothing. That says a lot!The cost cutting is evident in the parks, closing earlier than last year, the parks open at 9:30am but some rides don't open untill 11.00am this is what pissed me off the most.If the parks open it should all be operational!The Christmas decorations are the same year in year out, this year tho some cheap red ribbons tied around some lampposts and fake poinsettias in hanging baskets. Once you leave main street and venture into the parks you'd forget it was christmas. The castle twinkling lights on the turrets weren't turned on and never saw the advertised Christmas drone show at all it was the normal Disney electrical sky parade.Walls (not a typo) Disney studios is a mess, an absolute mess. To be charged full price to enter that park is a joke. A one ride frozen land won't fix this either.It's split down the middle with one walk way to get to either side of the ""park"" so rammed with people. The avengers campus toilet's are bad, and others dotted around the parks, no hot water,some taps not working,hand dryers not working and no paper to dry your hands. Lovely.Food and drink are extortionate and honestly not worth it for such basic food.Smoking/vaping and smoking cannabis is an issue in the parks and village.The lion king rhythm of the pride lands is amazing! Cast and crew well done! Can't recommend a visit and have not been with when friends ask how it went. Save ya hard earned money and go on a beach holiday all inclusive for 10 nights for what these conmen charge."
"What I didn't liked and few improvements suggestions:- Frozen themed events and attractions were missing. - Long waiting queues (particularly for meeting the characters and for the shows). - Very expensive souvenirs. - When is a bit windy the night show is not using the drones which makes the show a lot less spectacular... - The restaurants in the parks are closed in the evening 9most of them after 16:00) making it impossible to have dinner at a decent hour and then see the night shows (after the show is over - 22:00 is to late to grab dinner outside Disneyland Park because everything is closed so you end up starving in the night).- After the night show the park is closing immediately so everybody is leaving the park at the same time making it very hard to get home with that huge crowd heading to the same busses/metro/shuttle stations.- more surprise appearances of characters would be great. we only met Captain Hook. Maybe princesses (especially since for Princess Pavilion you have to wait so long in line and then meet whatever comes your way), fairies, no Frozen characters or shows available- some sort of virtual queues would be nice"
"Three days at Disneyland Paris with the family. The park was good, but some things worth mentioning for future travelers. It was cold. And the cold, in my opinion, is an obstacle to enjoying the park fully, since you have to wear several layers of clothes, every once in a while look for a Disney store or restaurant to enter and warm up a bit, and if it rains (as it did one day) then it is really challenging - I was with both my grandsons, 8 months old and 3 yrs old - since you need to cover them up and try to keep them dry. Next time I would certainly opt for a warmer season, even facing more visitors. Another cold factor was the ""cold"" reception by some of the staff there at Disneyland Paris. My French is OK, but my English much better. When asking to switch  to English there was a clear change in the attitude o some Disney personnel I came in contact with, at the kiosks especially. It looked like many of them were stressed out (my impression). It also seems that they reserve the low winter season to revamp the park, so many you see many closed maintenance areas. Needless to say that food and drinks in general there are very expensive, but that is a given. My 3 yr old still enjoyed every minute, so Disneyland is surely worth it, but I would recommend going in a warmer month."
A strange Disney Park I normally go to the Florida one but fancied a mini disney break. Good stuff*Disney Staff were great...*Thunder mountain is better than the florida one.* The train station is literally at the door* Magic Kingdom is impressiveBad Stuff* Hollystudios is more like a building site at the moment.* Disney Village is rubbish compared to Disney springs and the redevelopment plans look rubbish too.*Indiana Jones ride is dreadful and its really a cheap funfair ride thats had theming slapped onto it.*French people - They have a cultural habit of walking straight at you and expect YOU to move. I got fed up of moving out of their way so one attempted to push me in the middle of main street (think about the space they could have used)*RUBBISH WIFI - sorry Disney I can't pay for stuff online like fast track if your wifi is rubbish.
"‚ÄúMagical experience! Disneyland Paris is a dream come true with its enchanting atmosphere, thrilling rides, and incredible shows. The park is beautifully themed, and the attention to detail is unmatched. Perfect for families and Disney fans of all ages. Highly recommend!‚Äù"
"This was my second trip of 2024 and it was just as magical as the first! My dad came with us this time for his first Disney Parks Holiday and he is already wanting to plan the next one!We saw Disney in the snow which was wonderful, however I did get soaked and cold because we were not anticipating this so I would personally pack waterproof shoes and lots of layers because you can take layers off if you get too hot!I would say it was lacking in the merch department but that could also be because I have been to Florida twice and I was spoilt for choice there! The prices were reasonable though for most things and I just adore my new Disneyland Paris Fantasia Spirit Jersey!Overall, it was the most magical way to start this festive season and I look forward to planning another trip soon!"
"Although I'm not such a big Disney fan compared to when I was younger, I visited Disneyland Paris alongside my brother in September as he really wanted to see this. It is only the second Disneyland park I've visited as I went to the Orlando one many years ago. And I can say that it was pretty good, with various attractions from different Disney Films, including both Pixar and films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe/MCU (the latter of which was quite nice as I've recently started watching some MCU films). I also enjoyed watching the Disney parade with different Disney characters in the evening. There were also different eating areas present and the food I ate in the Stark Tower inside the MCU area was relatively good. Another thing I liked was that this place is easily accessible by public transport with an RER train line connecting the area directly with Central Paris (very convenient for us and I can say most of the other Disneyland Parks in the USA definitely need to take note from this), and it is also possible to get there by bus, taxi and high speed rail, not to mention it is also possible to get there by driving - although if you're a tourist, I strongly recommend getting there by public transport.The only things I didn't like were that the admissions prices were quite expensive (although it was worth it just for seeing this area) and the website was a bit misleading as the website stated that tickets should be bought online and wasn't clear enough that you could purchase tickets directly from there (I'm glad we could still buy tickets there as we otherwise wouldn't have been able to see this place). I would also advise anyone going there to go there early in the day (or if possible visit it in the span of two days) as since the park is so large, it can be difficult to see most of the rides - I only managed to get on one or two rides as there wasn't enough time. But apart from those, I did enjoy my time in Disneyland Paris a lot despite only spending a day there."
AMAZINGFriendly and fun.Very cold xnd can't do it all in one day.Staff and entertainment made up for the dismal weather.Only down side was the length of time waiting in ques.  Otherwise brilliant Time
"The park is good. There are some very strong attractions like Avengers or Finding Nemo, personally it made me sick because of the twists and turns it takes."
"A bit of Disney magic, character meets, amazing rides, the animation academy, the snacks! Even if it's just once - treat yourself!"
The attention and quality that we are use to from Disney in the states continues in Paris. Genius to have a metro station next to the park. Great experience. We went through both parks in 1 day (start with Hollywood studios).  I‚Äôd recommend the express pass. It‚Äôs a lot but well worth it.
"We had a fabulous time at Disneyland Paris recently.  Flew to Paris then took the fast train straight to the Disneyland station, well worth doing the train as it only takes 10 mins though it was full and we had to stand.  Had a half day in Universal park then a full day and a half in the Disneyland park.  Went on lots of rides though had to queue for most of them but expected that.  The parade was amazing and the lights on the castle at night were fantastic.  An absolutely fab time was had by all and will def go again."
"We came to Disney for my girlfriend‚Äôs 30th for a single day. We travelled from the UK to be there. It snowed and almost all the rides were shut. One of the ones we went to broke down after a 30 minute wait. This was at the end of the day so it would have been our last ride. They gave 0 compensation‚Ä¶ not even a key chain which felt very stingey. So basically no rides, bad over priced food and no fireworks which is why we actually came to Disneyland"
"Hello, my trip to Disneyland Paris was a horrible experience.  Due to heavy snow and bad weather, 95% of attraction rides were closed . Definitely need a refund! We took our vacations just for this occasion to spend a wonderful and everlasting experience. And we had none of that.Please contact me on my refund .Best Regards Angelica Rodriguez."
"Where to begin... Maud in the restaurant near Star Wars needs a serious attitude adjustment, Other staff disinterested, talking amongst themselves and some glued to mobile phones while managing queues... Many of the rides are closed and there's building work right in the main area where you enter and leave the park... IMHO, having been to Orlando 3 times and here once, I'd never visit Paris again... Just poor in general."
"I wouldnt go again to be honest. The food was terrible, I dont mind paying over priced for decent food but Mc donalds food was better than the two restaurants we went to in the park. The que for chip and dale was 1.5 hours long with them having 3 'mini breaks'. The rides were never less than 30minutes mostly 45-1 hour. Not a lot of character viewing and all were spread so far apart making it nearly impossible to get to all. I think the buzz lightyear ride broke down not sure if it was part of the ride but it certainly diddnt make the ride any better. Lots of agro between people at firework and parade time, mostly adults arguing and pushing, one lady pushed my 9 year old to get more to the front feel this needs better arranging. The hotel offered 'free coffee' 2 free a day but when we finally found the machine you couldnt fit our standard size mugs in them. You have to pay extra to visit mikey. The 're fillable' drinks means going and paying for another drink with the same cup, you have a qr code that only allows one use. We paid for the lion king show and was 1 minute late and not allowed in, it diddnt state you needed to be half an hour early like the lady told us when she refused us entrance."
"We celebrated our wedding anniversary at Disneyland Paris, and it was absolutely magical! The park was beautifully decorated, and the atmosphere was full of joy and excitement.We loved the parades, meeting the Disney characters, and enjoying all the fun rides. The fireworks at night were the perfect way to end our special day‚Äîthey were breathtaking!We also had a lovely surprise waiting for us at our hotel room, which made our celebration even more memorable. The little touches made us feel so special!Disneyland Paris made our anniversary so memorable, and it‚Äôs a place we‚Äôll always cherish. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
"Couldn't believe the good value I got the park tickets for,half the price of the tickets on Disney website! Highly recommend"
"Another flawless visit to Disneyland. Having been to Disneyland in California and Japan, this visit to Paris Disneyland was as good or better. The ease of access to Disneyland from the Paris Metro is second to none. The park met all expectations, clean, friendly staff and amenities, great rides and lots to see and do."
"We had such a magical time with our 4 year old. You see a lot of grumbling and complaining in reviews but an unbiased view is just go to have a good time and immerse yourself in it. Plenty of characters to meet, rides were decent, shows were good but some were amazing such as lion king and the magical mickey one. Parades all awesome and firework show spectacular. We did lunch with the princesses which was brilliant, also reserved standing for the fireworks which felt worth the money. We found 99% of the staff were super friendly and helped to make the experience."
"This was my first time to experience Christmas at Disneyland Paris and have to say it was very magical.  The whole atmosphere was superb, the decorations were first class  I will definitely return again on future"
"Great first visit to Disney Paris‚Ä¶friendly staff, great atmosphere and a wonderfully clean park. The christmas lights and parade were amazing. Brilliant fun for the kids.Queues can be long but its expected. Highly recommend a visit"
"Too busy, overrated and overpriced. Once you've taken into account the rip off prices for literally everything, you can go to much better theme parks for half the price (eg Efteling). Considering the profile of this brand there are also surprisingly few serious rides here. Needs serious investment and new rides rather than just sticking a new theme on old rides. Studios is currently a dump... Just a giant building site. Two rides I was on today broke down while I was in the Q. Ride times generally long because they are letting too many people into the park. Overall. Very poor. You have been warned"
"If you want big mouths from park employees and improper treatment, this park is the place to be, otherwise don't go there"
Me and family went to Disney land in March and it was amazing the rides were great not as long as a queue as I had thought universal Studios were really nice  we all enjoyed it but then we went over to Disney land and had the time of our lives the music was phenomenal and so was the food definitely gonna come again!
"Poor experience at Disney Park with family. Major issues: inaccurate map directions, extremely long wait times (80+ min for Mickey) with no seating, and lack of staff assistance for directions. Restaurant had no Disney characters as promised. Stroller rental was overpriced. Couldn't enjoy many attractions due to exhaustion and poor navigation. Overall, basic amenities were overpriced and the park failed to deliver the promised magical experience for young children"
"Uphill struggle at Big Thunder Mountain! Mountain malfunctions in the middle of the big thunder mountain experience. I travelled day and night, over sea, queued for a lifetime to go on big thunder mountain. How would you feel if you waited forever to do something and it smacked you in the face. At full speed, as fast as a cheetah, the ride came to a sudden jolt. Smack. ""Staff will be with you shortly to help you off the ride,"" said the announcement.   We walked down Mount Everest to get back to land.All was not lost though as we went on it multiple times and it was exhilarating! We also had a thrilling time on Tower of Terror, Hyperspace Mountain, Peter pan's flight and Crush's Coaster.I recommend bringing your own food, as its very expensive for small amounts. Be kind to your wallet."
Where have all the characters gone?!? We saw 2 characters around the park through a whole weekend here. Nothing like it used to be
"Loved it, a bit too long walk to parks from hotel but it is fine. Amazing rollercoasters and attractions , my favorite was toer of terror or something like that.  Workers really bring that disney magic vibe.  Everywhere is super clean, gardens beautiful. I have so many good pictures and feelings from that place. I highly recommend, but make sure to choose right time to come as some attractions can be under maintance. I have been there 2 times from another country."
"As a family, we went to Disneyland for 4 days, which was great. The only downside, the toilets wasn't kept clean, and when you have young ones, it wasn't great as the staff didnt keep on top of it with checks."
"Ticket worked fine, we were able to skip the line, and go right in. Disneyland Paris is much smaller than Disney in Florida, but it was a nice day. Fun to say I‚Äôve been to Disney Paris too!"
"We visited last weekend in October and the parks were at full capacity! It was very busy, que for the toilets, que for a drink/snacks, que for lunch, que for rides etc. we did manage to get quite alot of rides in though surprisingly, the app helps telling you the ride queue times so you can plan the day better. We have been before so we knew what to expect and we had a plan of which rides we wanted to go on. My son is just 1.2m tall so we were able to go on some really big rides and his first upside down rollercoaster (avengers). We had a great weekend, the drone and fireworks show is very impressive.Next time we will come mid week though and avoid the weekends.The halloween decorations aren't anything special so not really worth coming in october just for this."
"I've been coming to Disneyland Paris for the last 20 years, but this is the first time I've felt that the Disney magic was missing. There are lots of renovations and new building works going on particularly at Disney Studios. The background noise of diggers and hoarding erected everywhere were intrusive and made the area feel even more crowded. We visited during the week after half term, and it was crazy busy. It feels that there is no control over visitor numbers, and this has resulted in ridiculously long waits on all rides. Not sure if I am likely to return any time soon."
"Staff are rude and arrogant.We expected it to be expensive, but they really take advantage of parents in a parasitic way. Hong Kong one was better despite being smaller, the staff have a huge impact on the experience - well not be returning any time soon. The children enjoyed themselves, but they're quite easily entertained luckily."
"Wow, where do you start. Firstly I went to Disneyland Paris 20 years ago and had a fantastic time so I was looking forward to sharing this place with my family. I booked the family of four tickets and arrived at 10:00. We had the app and booked lunch at 12:00. We decided to go to Big Thunder Mountain as the app said it was a 55 minute wait. We got to the line at 10:50 and finished the ride at 12:40! Almost two hours and missed our lunch. We ended up buying four pretty average burritos and four drinks for ‚Ç¨75 and set out again. In the eight hours we were at the park we 6 hours were spent in queues. We managed 5 rides in that whole time. Even buying a hot chocolate took half an hour and so we just gave up around 18;00. Unless you are willing to spend big on queue jumping passes (which I morally object to) you need the patience of a saint to come to Disneyland Paris. The magic has drained out of this place which is unbelievably sad"
"A fantastic trip to Disney with my family, shame the Disney magic isn‚Äôt present in the Disneyland hotel my daughter has autism and was collecting the stickers at the hotel etc and went in to see the princesses at the hotel so asked at reception who gave her one then at the concierge who just said your not a resident show me your magic pass if your not you carnt have one !!! Wow were is the magic in that hotel !!! Left my daughter really upset after the interaction !!!"
Not to bad....apart from the time in the Qs waiting...if it says 35 mins it's usually over a hour etc etc!!!Still a good experience though ..good luck for the future
"As expected, all of the parades, lights shows and most of the rides are great. What is poor is the interaction in the park. We'd been telling our little girl to expect to meet all her favourite characters but over 2 full days in the park we only saw the D list characters Pluto, Tigger and Jafar (all in photo areas with long lines).We booked a character breakfast so thought that would improve matters but instead we got Pinocchio, Gepeto, Captain Hook, Smee and Eeyore. Not a single child new who Gepeto and Smee were. For the obscene amount of money this place rakes in, surely they could afford to populate it with some Mickeys, Minnie's, Princesses or the parks unofficial mascot Stitch who is just everywhere.We stayed in Sequoia Lodge and for the price, you'd expect luxury but all meals are extra cost (25 euros for a buffet breakfast, 45 for evening meal) and the only luxury was a kettle and coffee machine (but no mini fridge for milk and the like)"
"Disneyland Paris delivers exactly what you would expect: a magical and fun-filled destination packed with music, entertainment, thrilling rides, and shops brimming with Disney-themed treasures. The park offers so much to see and do, all while being impeccably maintained to the highest standard. Adding to the experience are the friendly and helpful staff who go out of their way to ensure that guests have a memorable time.One of the downsides, however, comes not from the park itself but from some of the visitors. The sheer number of guests with camera phones can be overwhelming, especially those who seem to be there solely for photo opportunities. It‚Äôs not uncommon to see people changing into various outfits and posing with props, which can make popular spots like the iconic castle more crowded than usual.That said, if you can manage to look past these camera-focused visitors and enjoy the park on your own terms, the experience remains highly enjoyable. The key to having a great time at Disneyland Paris is to embrace the crowds and plan accordingly. Yes, it‚Äôs busy‚Äîbut that‚Äôs to be expected. By using the official Disneyland app to track ride times and plan your day, you can maximize your experience and cover more ground. The app is an invaluable tool for navigating the park efficiently.One visit to Disneyland Paris is best spread over several days to truly take in all the attractions and entertainment it offers. And be prepared for lots of walking; it‚Äôs a sprawling space that will have you getting in plenty of steps by the end of your stay.In summary, Disneyland Paris is a vibrant, well-maintained theme park full of fun and wonder. While the crowds and camera-centric visitors can be a slight drawback, the overall magic of the park more than makes up for it. With a little planning and patience, it‚Äôs an experience that‚Äôs definitely worth it."
"Had such a wonderful Halloween trip to Disneyland Paris.  Stayed in the beautiful Newport Bay Hotel in a Compass Club room.  The hotel and the staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble.  They made the whole stay fun and really engaged with our granddaughter.  The staff made sure that we had everything we needed for a perfect stay.  The park looked beautiful with the Halloween decorations and the 'villains' who were located at various areas of the park were great fun.  The rides, although busy, were worth the wait.  There was a good range of food and drink available around both parks and the parades and shows were very enjoyable.  Our granddaughter visited the princess pavilion and also had a princess breakfast which she absolutely loved.  We were also lucky enough to get the Royal Dream for her and she was treated like a princess from start to finish!  This was certainly a holiday she won't forget!Although the Studios park is under renovation at present, there was a good range of rides and the shows available were excellent.  There were also Marvel characters roaming around the area so we had good interactions there too.We would definitely visit again at Halloween - or any other time of the year in all honesty!!"
"We visited Disneyland Paris over the Halloween period, and it is definitely a must. The Halloween decorations was amazing and everywhere tou looked, you knew it was Halloween. The shows were very good and I would highly recommend them. We had 3 and a half days at the parcs, and we managed to do most of the rides and 3 shows. The children loved Micky mouse and Mini and all the other characters. we managed to get 11 signatures and pictures of a few more. Would highly advise the breakfast with the characters if you can afford it, if not, don't worry, you can see most of them around the parc but you will have to que anything from 10 - 30 minutes all times are on the app and locations.The disney app is very good and accurate on waiting times. Most of the time, one day it was a bit off but you can look for yourself.We managed to do all of the things we wanted to do in the 3 and a half days and I will tell you now you need your walking boots we covered 75000 steps in the time we where there.There are plenty of toilets on the site and very well located.There are water dispensers in many locations so to save money we used water bottles and used squash to top it up and add flavour. We had the small squeeze bottles that give you about 20 fills.The place is amazing as with everywhere similar the cost of drink and food is a bit pricey but the place is magical and make the most of it."
"It is 1 million % worst it to visit. We ourselves were in 2 minds because the kids are close to teens and we thought kids might not be interested. But wow, forget the kids, we ourselves as adult enjoyed it so much that can't describe it.all ages of people come there and have so much for all to have fun. It is an experience of life time. We as adults go back to our childhood. So many rides and waiting time is not much on a weekday. I mean 15 to 25 minutes but chit chatting, taking pictures, munching few stuff, the time passes and then when you go through that experience then you realise it was worth the wait. Amazing amazing amazing experience and one must go to Disneyland if in Paris.both the parks can be done easily in one day, no need to buy 2 day pass."
"The park is in need of renovation. In general you will experience long queues for fairly old rides, poor theming of areas and overpriced food options. The Star Wars area has particularly bad theming."
Excellent hospitable staff members who helped me with tickets üéü as I missed my dates  and were kind enough to swap the dates.
"An amazing 4 day trip with family and greater family. The parades were brilliant, shows we worth the early que and wait. recommend the lion king and mickey apprentice, but legroom was too restricted for me and i had to leave. planning your timings for rides was the best thing. early pass allowed us to focus on the big rides and the disneyland app allowed us to see the real time wait times and move on to other rides. Thunder mountain went down several times, but being flexible was the best route. Allow for wet weather gear in the spring and whilst others were hiding we hit big rides with no wait times at all. we loved every minute, the kids went on almost every ride. if you don't like heights avoid tower rides but there is plenty to go and see. at 6ft 3 i could fit in every ride. tight on a couple but i was never unable to go on. walking across the park soon racks up walking distances. so good shoes are a must. Early passes in and staying late allowed us all to get extra rides. Can't wait to go back"
"It‚Äôs a Disney park, so we all know what to expect. The rides were decent, albeit short. The character meets were wonderful. Plenty of access to food, drink and toilets. The parades were excellent as was the light and fireworks show at the end of the day. Staff throughout were brilliant and helpful.Now, onto some more negative thoughts.We stayed at the on-site Newport Bay Hotel which is a 10 minute walk to the park gates. This is mostly pleasant, alongside the lake which has Santa Fe and The Marvel hotels on it too. However, once past the lake you get rudely ushered through a tent with paramilitary-looking security people to scan/x-ray everything. I understand that security is important but surely there is a way of making this more in keeping with the Disney theme and less oppressive? Maybe dressed as Storm Troopers or something? Then through the Disney village into another ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù before finally being able to get through the park gates themselves.After dark the park is very dark, the lighting isn‚Äôt great. Golden Hour with the hotels is pretty much useless as the vast majority of rides are closed. It also seems that no one queues, personal space is a problem, and no one smokes quite like the French. Despite signage, the park is full of people walking round smoking and vaping."
"Worths going. Children are happy, adults too. Long waiting times but with the right companion it feels almost acceptable."
"I Went with my granddaughter and we had so much fun! We took the metro from Paris, which took us straight to EuroDisney!  It was a fun experience that I highly recommend!"
"The parades, shows and evening light/ firework shows are amazing. My one suggestion is do NOT bother doing the princess meet and greet! Queued for 2 hours, nothing to entertain children during this time, moved a metre every 20mins, for my two daughters to get 3minutes with Mulan! üôà"
"If I had visited before going to Disney, florida I think I would have enjoyed myself but nothing can compare to floridas disney"
Staff in the park were rude and aggressive towards my children and argued with myself over things that were avoidable
"Hugely overcrowded with massive queues for most rides (1 hour plus for 5 minute ride), made worse by those paying even more than most to jump the queue. Rides themselves were good once on. Parades were great. Light show great, fireworks  very late for children and seemed poor compared to 30 years ago when we last went. Few staff around the park to ask for directions. Accept that we went at peak time  but still far too many tickets sold for the capacity of the park. Rides frequently broke down, though mended quickly.  Many rides did not start till 9.30  so an early entry ticket at 8.30 did not help. the shows in the Studios  the highlight of the trip"
"Great day with the grandchildren 10and 12 so they could go on all the rides,  had fast tract tickets which were very expensive but saved queuing."
"Fantastic experience for our grandson, very stressfull for the adults with the amount of people, however, for all the faults from an adults point of view the happiness it gives the youngsters makes it all worthwhile, topped off with a fantastic end of evening show that is worth the wait, food seems expensive but not that much more than family meal out in the UK, just happens to be every niight"
"everything was magical, especially Mickey Mouse. we had a great time at the hotel we chose. we never could have imagined that a hotel stay can have such pack in such a magical experience!"
"All tickets on the Disney Website were sold out- thanks, TripAdvisor, for the same day tickets for the normal price!! We had a blast."
Very disappointed with how jame packed the park was. There was clearly no regard for reasonable capacity in this park. I've been to disney in California and it was way better. There are no timed tickets at this park so forget about being able to go on all the rides. We were there from 9:30-7:30 and were able to go on 6 rides and see 1 princess. The cue for the princess was 1.5 hours and you don't even get to know whay princess it is. Spent less than 5mins with her. Do not go for one day unless you pay the crazy fee for the skip the line pass. The rich get rewarded here.
"An excellent family experience spent over three days in the park. A truly unique place, offering a wide range of activities and attractions.On the first day, we mostly didn‚Äôt use Premier Access for the rides. Queuing wasn‚Äôt too bad, but most waits were around 40 minutes, so we managed about one ride per hour. On the second day, we made extensive use of Premier Access, which made for a much more enjoyable day as we were able to experience everything. While it‚Äôs very expensive, purchasing individual access for rides turned out to be much cheaper than a general day pass. We used our final day to catch a couple of shows, both of which were brilliant.While the park certainly aims to maximise spending, it offers an experience unlike any other theme park. We found many of the rides to be quite unique‚Äînot only Disney-themed but also mechanically different. There‚Äôs a great use of cinematic effects on many attractions.We first visited when our children were 4 and 2, and nine years later we enjoyed a very different visit‚Äîmore rides, fewer princesses. The park caters brilliantly for all ages."
3 Days at Disneyland were perfect. Magic all over. The weather was fantastic and so all the waiting in lines was fine. We actually did the 90% of the activities in the 2 parks. If you have a good program and use the app will be very easy to not just wait in long lines for hours. All the rides where fantastic and full of excitement and thrill. Already planning on coming back in 2026 for the Frozen Park. Thank you Disneyland Paris for the incredible memories.
"After having problems with tickets two years ago, we stupidly gave this place a second chance. We entered the Studio park unaware we could only visit one. Big mistake as most of it was boarded up, so a complete waste of time. Then after lunch went to other park and refused entry. So ¬£240 to walk around a building site - disgusting NEVER AGAIN avoid at all costs ALSO rip off prices, extortionate"
"My partner, brother in law, 2 nieces and myself went to Disneyland for the first time and boy was it busy. Most rides took at least 40 minutes to qu√© up for, pirates of the Caribbean and phantom manor. Big thunder mountain took over an hour to qu√© up for (it was a good ride which is why this is a 2/5 rather than a 1. 2 small pizzas cost ‚Ç¨40. A bottle of coke ‚Ç¨4.50. Lunch for 5 people where we had burritos cost over ‚Ç¨80. A bubble blower cost ‚Ç¨30!! That was the most overrated priced thing we bought. The staging of Disneyland is nice and seeing characters dressed up makes slightly special moments but overall for the price you pay to go to Disney to just stand in ques it's not truly worth it. I'm unlikely to go back."
"Went to celebrate my daughters 30 th birthday whilst we stopped in Paris for a few days. To be honest wasn‚Äôt particularly looking forward to it but she wanted to go , so we did . We had the 2 park Pass and got on 5 rides in the time we were there. Never queued for more than 45 mins apart from the photos with Chip and Dale . We ate in the park and found the food good quality and very reasonable price wise .  Being October the park  was decked out for Halloween making it a little more special, giving you lots more photo opportunities.  The 5.00 pm parade was very entertaining being Halloween based , with the drone show adding a brilliant end to the day . These parks really bring out the child in you and we want to go again next time we are in Paris ."
It‚Äôs just a seriously overpriced shopping and food mall with a few rides ‚Äòthrown in‚Äô that you may well have to wait an hour and a half to get into!
"Overrated, very crowded, and very limited rides. Except for the experience and ambiance, the rides are very average. If you think it will be like Orlando, you will be disappointed.The drone show and the fireworks were amazing; but it is very late in the night and if you are dependent on public transportation, it is risky to reach back."
me and my family were totally satisfied and surely visit next timeeverything was completely professional
"We visited Disneyland September, now I must admit it has never been a dream of mine to go here, but I am now converted.Booking was super easy, I booked about 6 months in advance and it allows you to make part payments.Arriving at the park by Eurostar train is super easy and then you just hop on a convenient bus to your hotel.Managing everything via the app is super easy and a must. The park is spectacular with so many things to see, do and eat.The staff are absolutely fantastic."
"This was my 3rd time. Last time 2015, we were able to enter both Disneyland park and Disneyland Studio in 1 ticket. We got to watch many shows and enjoy fast passes. The parades were long and beautiful. Now we can only enter 1 park with 1 ticket. Shows were with additional charge and you have to buy the ticket for Disneystudios. Forget fast pass unless you pay extra for ""Premier Access."" We waited 1.15 hrs for 1 minute of Peterpan ride. This might be the last time I wasted my money here at Disneyland Paris. The good old Disney days are gone."
"Second time returning to Eurodisney. We stayed in an apartment close to Eurodisney this time, rather than a Disney hotel as we wanted to get away and experience serris also. We travelled on the buses to and from the park. It was as usual very crowded and long queues during the daytime but when we returned for the evening it wasn't so crowded. The castles were lit up beautifully.  The daytime parade was spectacular. The illuminations and fireworks brilliant! Be prepared to be exhausted!"
"I have no words, a perfect animation for children, adults, all ages. You live a fairy tale, everything is colorful and very special."
Had two great days and really enjoyed it. The only thing is the waiting time for a ride. We spent 2 hours in line just for one ride and on average 50 minute for some of the attractions üëé. The parades are great but have to stand a least 30 minutes before and then you get someone pushing and standing in front of youüëé. The night display with lights is awesome and well worth the waiting completing with a firework di8üëåüëç‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ the best part.
We had a fantastic family experience.I would recommend if possible to stay all day.This means that as the evening draws in queuing for rides is much reduced.The parades are excellent creating a wonderful atmosphere and although waiting time can be long the rides are great fun and enjoyable.Fab  time and happy memories.
"We spent the October School week at Disneyland Paris and stayed in the Cheyenne Hotel. There were 9 of us  and we were allocated 3 rooms next to each other, very close to the path that leads to the parks. The hotel was great. Staff were friendly and couldn't do enough for you. The rooms were large comfortable and cleaned every day. Before going I applied for a disabled Priority Pass and spoke to the concierge on my arrival at the hotel. After I presented the written evidence of my disability I was given the pass. This was a perfect for my trip. I was allowed to avoid the queues and could take up to 4 of my family with me. The staff in the parks were also brilliant and very helpful. Before going on this trip I was worried about how I would manage and with the pass and the help of my family and staff it was brilliant. We ate in several  places in the 2 parks and also in the Village as well as the Buffet at the hotel one evening. I cannot fault any of the places we ate at. The food was good, plentiful and freshly cooked and the staff were were always pleasant and helpful. My grandkids loved it, I am 70 and I loved it and can't wait to go back."
"Overall, a very enjoyable stay.We are a family of four; with a 2 year old and 9 year old.We found the theme park to be really well presented with all of the Disney magic you could expect.The park was busy, but not too busy.We managed to get on most of the rides that we wanted to, and the rides with larger queues we waited until post 7pm, and then it was pretty early to get on.The electric show was great, so were the shows.What‚Äôs stopped the 5 stars, is the amount of people smoking, having visited the Orlando parks, I didn‚Äôt even realise Disney allowed smoking.Minor issues are people pushing in the queues, and there seemed to be phases during the day when quite a few rides were broken down.Overall, highly recommend"
"Disney just cancelled without any reason our reservation for Plaza Garden. I hear they did that for more people. We‚Äôre staying in one of the hotels (the most expensive), booked for multiple nights, no point in calling because they can‚Äôt do anything. So yeah overpriced and underdelivered, it‚Äôs that we have kids who are really looking forward to this."
Had a perfect first visit to Disneyland Paris for our daughter‚Äôs fifth and eleventh birthdays this Halloween.
I think if you are going to promote protecting the planet you need to significantly reduce the plastic from your merchandise.
Had a lpvely visit but not quiet disabled friendly. They allow way to many im so very overcrowded and after the lumination show ots very dark an not enough lighting to make way out the park. The kerbs are not highlighted so not easy to manoeuvre about
Lots to like about Disneyland and lots everyone will already know and love. Well worth it for the experience it leaves on your children. Yes it‚Äôs expensive and yes it‚Äôs a massive corporation but hence it is what it is.
"Easy way of booking, trouble free. Directed linked to the park app. Hassle free. Great option overall, would do it again."
"AMAZING experience. I‚Äôve been to Disneyland Paris (then called EuroDisney) 30 years ago and now we came back to celebrate my son‚Äôs 13th birthday. The kids (13, 9, 9 and 8 months) had SO much fun with all the rides, shows and parades! A definite must"
"Amazing experience, a must come place!However!!! Be aware of the employee Leane from the Dumbo Elephant carousel attraction. She was aggressively screaming at people, and considering the fact that there are mostly families with kids, it was completely unprofessional and created an unpleasant and unwelcoming atmosphere. A large group of people, my family included, was standing in the wrong waiting line because the guiding signs were obstructed from the view, so Leanne started screaming loudly with her high pinching voice that we must leave immediately because we don‚Äôt have any right to be in the priority line. When I tried to explain to her that the signs were not clear, and we were standing there already for 10 minutes waiting, she raised her voice even louder and aggressively kept pointing to the exit, so I grabbed my kids and rushed out just for them not to get scared of her behavior. We laughed at the situation, but it was a very strange feeling inside of me that something might be psychologically wrong with this employee.  Hoping to never see her again, we had to start over in another waiting line, because my kids really wanted to fly at the Dumbo Elephant. When our turn came 40 minutes later, Leanne was there again‚Ä¶ She was yelling again because she needed me to move in order to find a smaller group of people, but behind her yelling I misunderstood and I thought that she was telling us to hurry, so she yelled to my face that I can‚Äôt cross the turnstile and I have to wait where she points to. At this point I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore and I asked her to please speak respectfully without yelling, I mentioned that it‚Äôs the second time she‚Äôs unnecessary rude and that she creates a horrible atmosphere for the families and little kids especially. I had to say it loud because she kept yelling, and people around started to nod and say things how unprofessional and aggressive this girl is. When Leanne was yelling back to me, I just asked her to call the manager because it was truly unacceptable. Leanne‚Äôs excuse was that she has earphones in her ears so she‚Äôs forced to scream. But other employees at this attraction also had earphones, however they were nice and welcoming, and we felt their respectful attitude towards us and other guests. The manager apologized for Leanne‚Äôs behavior and this situation in general, but he insisted that she is a very good worker. I asked him to check the cameras, if there are any, and to judge the situation himself. I was very disappointed with this experience and I wished my kids didn‚Äôt have to encounter such a rude incompetent attendant who creates an aggressive atmosphere in the kids environment. I hope someone from the Dumbo Elephant carousel attraction will read my feedback and take into consideration."
"Revisited here after first visiting back in 1996. It's a good idea to download the Disney app as it gives you the times of parades, shows and queueing times of the attractions but found the app was a bit useless unless you had WiFi access. We visited here on a Monday outside the main school holidays but found it still to be as busy as if it were the peak times.The park is beautifully maintained as you'd expect from Disney but there are a number of building works going on and some of the rides were closed. There's still plenty of stuff for all ages to do and there were shows and parades which we missed because we wasted so much time queueing. Most of the rides were great with some quirky rides too and a few white knuckle ones which'll please the older kids.The highlight for me was the fantastic fireworks and drone show at the end of the night. We had to stand at the back of main street much of the area is closed off 30 minutes before the display starts. We spent almost 12 hours in the park walking just shy of 10 miles and were totally shattered by the end of the day. I would like to go back again in the future but my advice is give it a few years when Disney finish doing all of the building works.A tiring day, but great fun."
"Overall:The trip had some extremely magical moments thanks to the hotel, the characters and some extras we got staying here. I booked directly through the Disneyland Paris website and it was a simple process and there were a number of options for paying. The Studios park, despite the ongoing works was great fun, and I‚Äôm excited to visit here in the future but the Disneyland park was a bit of a let down. The magic has seriously been lost in this park, between people queue jumping (I don‚Äôt mean priority pass but literally grown adults hoping barriers), shoving small children to the ground and miserable cast members, the experience didn‚Äôt live up to expectations (I‚Äôll explain more below). Overall however we had a great few days and we‚Äôre already planning our next Disney adventure (possibly a UK cruise ü§û). Day 1 - Travel and Hotel:I ordered the express luggage service through Disney which meant we could head straight to the park on arrival and do some attractions before our hotel was ready. I would recommend this for anyone who thinking of booking it. We met Darth Vader (shout out to cast member Fredric managing the queue here who was wonderful), and did a few extra . Great start to the trip! We headed over to our hotel, Hotel New York - Art of Marvel which is simply wonderful, from the artwork to the interior design, we loved the experience. That evening we had dinner in the Manhattan with wine included for me, which I thoroughly enjoyed, followed by drinks at the skyline bar and a trip to the kids club to draw some superhero‚Äôs. We loved the whole superhero‚Äôs in the city vibe everywhere in the hotel. Day 2 - Hotel Extras and Studios Park:The morning at the hotel we had breakfast delivered to our room, which came to ‚Ç¨24 for two of us so we could eat and get ready for the day at the same time. I wish in hindsight we did this more or got a meal plan because breakfast options aren‚Äôt great (or much cheeper) in the village. Our morning was taken up exploring the hotel and meeting Captain America at the superhero station before we headed off to the pool for a dip. The pool was warm, Jacuzzi was really nice and the sauna was lovely to relax. Only downside here is the depth of the pool which isn‚Äôt great if you‚Äôre not a strong swimmer (like me). My son loved it however because he can tread water, but there‚Äôs lots of floatation toys and free armbands if your little ones aren‚Äôt swimmers.  By midday we were strolling over to studios park and using the app to plan stops we managed all the ‚Äúbig rides‚Äù and the Pixar Show. A tip for Crush is to wait until the end of the day when people are heading over to the main park for the fireworks. We joined the queue at 7:30pm and were able to ride and still have time for another go of ratatouille before closing at 8pm. We loved the Studio park despite the work ongoing, the different worlds are beautifully designed here and can‚Äôt wait to see frozen / lion king. For dinner we ate at PYMs which is perfect for families and a big winner for any marvel fans, with lots of options for fussy eaters.Day 3 - Disneyland Park:We decided to grab something on the way to the park for breakfast and stopped at Starbucks which is fine but it lacked that magic we had in the hotel breakfast. It also came to ‚Ç¨18 so wasn‚Äôt a massive saving. As it was Halloween season the park was decorated but Frontierland was amazing. Probably our favourite area of the park. Fantasyland was looking very rundown and in desperate need of a paint and discoveryland is a bit off with the mix of Star Wars, Buzz and the Jules Verne vibe, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs been thrown together rather than thought out. Maybe it‚Äôll get updated after studios. Again I used the app as much as possible to do the rides, Peter Pan wasn‚Äôt open for magic hour so missed out here. I would recommend anyone thinking of it, just buy a priority pass for this ride, we queued for 1.5 hours. The app said 50 minutes but I don‚Äôt think it accounted for the number of people queue jumping. It seems in this park particularly the etiquette is that one member of the group will wait in line while others go about the park and come back to join the queue with the person waiting. Frustrating but not really Disney‚Äôs fault. All other rides we queued 5-20 minutes for because I used the app, which I think is pretty good and managed to get done everything we wanted including doing Pirates and Phantom Mannor twice. We skipped dinner today and instead wanted to try lots of the Halloween/Disney snacks but this was very hit or miss. Churos, burritos and a batwing doughnut in Frontierland were nice and suited the theming. The corn dog and popcorn from fantasyland was our favourite. Cafe Hyperion where they sell the Micky Halloween burger was atrocious. We waited 20 minutes to get served, the poor guy at the till kept getting up and going to the counter because the server couldn‚Äôt work fast enough for the orders coming though so he was trying to chip in and catch up the orders. When we did get our food and went to find a seat one cast member shouted at me for trying to sit at a 4 seat table when there were only two of us. She made us get up and follow her around the restaurant looking for a two seater table. People were looking and it felt very uncomfortable being paraded around when there was a number of empty tables. She then had to make us up a 2 seater space near the exit ramp which was even worse because prams and wheelchair users were blocked but she told us to sit and eat very abruptly. I just wanted to get out of there so badly so we quickly ate the burgers and left. There was no drone show on the evening which I expected because there had been poor weather all week and we didn‚Äôt see much of the fireworks either. The one thing that topped me over the edge in this park was a grown man pushing my son to the floor where he was seriously hurt, he is still bruised from how hard he was pushed and a number of people were annoyed along with me and were telling this man to apologies but he simply shrugged his shoulders and went about filming the fireworks. Cast members used to be dotted along main street and would stop pushing and shoving but this has died off which is a shame. I would recommend anyone with children try and buy a priority pass simply from a safety perspective. Day 4 - Last Day / Check out:We got up early and headed to the parks for a few last rides, as well as a trip to the dragon and meeting with Maleficent before heading back to the hotel at 10am. When we got back the hotel staff were already in the middle of changing the room so we had to get our cases and sort ourselves in the corridor. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for me because we were leaving but if people are waiting until the 11am check out this might be slightly annoying.All in all we really enjoyed, the hotel and extras were outstanding and anyone planning to stay at the hotel you will have an amazing time."
"Omg it‚Äôs amazing stuff childhood dreams are made of and you definitely won‚Äôt want to come home , from the minute you enter it‚Äôs wonderful for children and adults we got a 3 day ticket but next time will do 5 days as there is so much to see and do the rides the shows the parades are outstanding , every single detail is magical , I would suggest and hope everyone visits at least once in there lifetime , believe me you will return"
"Visited for the 1st time, two adults & two teenage boys.  We arrived half an hour before the park opened & got to the front of the ques for it opening. We went at it all day only stopping for food & left at the fireworks at the end. We managed to see all the parades, do most of the rides & attractions apart from a few small ones.  I have been to Florida & yes, as a comparison this doesn't have all the attractions Florida does, but it's pretty much the same as the Magic Kingdom! Remember it's not 'Disneyworld', it's 'Disneyland'. It's a brilliant day out, has something for everyone & is still a great Disney park! Wear comfy trainers, get a good sleep the night before & be prepared to be tired out if you're going to try get round everything in one day!"
"Just returned from our first every trip to Disneyland  Paris and cant wait to go back.  The Pixar and Mickey the Magician shows are just outstanding.  I went to both twice over two days and would have went again if we hadn't run out of time.  Even the storm on our first day didn't ruin our trip although it rained heavily for the entire day.  Our teenagers aged 16 and 13 loved it. Make sure to have ponchos and silicone shoe covers or wellies for the little ones to keep dry.  Its a long day and being wet from head to toe isn't ideal.  We purchased our park tickets direct and were surprised not to be allowed to change the dates in advance when a storm was forecast.  My husband had a major spinal surgery in January and only just received a letter from the surgeon the day before our trip which didn't allow us to go through the proper channel to get a pass .  The letter unfortunately didn't suffice at customer service so we had to buy fast passes as he could not stand in the queues.    I would recommend if buying this to be prepared that the 90 euro per day for the pass as shown on the app is from 90 euros and in fact was 120 euros per pass.  Also you can only use it once on each ride.  I would also advise you get the digital pass and a printed pass as you can loose signal in the park.  One thing that surprised me was the food situation.  I had read really bad reviews but we had a great food experience in the Rainforest Cafe.  We also stumbled across Toad Hall based in Fantasyland.  With its  beautiful stone exterior and old world charm interior it had the best fish and chips we have had in years, newspaper and all !!  Highly recommend.  I had read about rides closing without notice etc and that is unfortunately the case,  they can be closed for many hours.  Hopefully its a safety issue and not a staffing issue as the later would not be acceptable.Unfortunately due to the storm on our first day we only got to catch the light show on the second night.  The crowds are daunting however it was beautiful.  Renovation works aside the gardens and planting are just beautiful as are the little shops.  I would love to return in both summer and at Christmas over the next few years.  We had stayed in Centreparcs which is one of the Disney hotels.  I would heavily recommend you avoid this accommodation.  Having walked Disneyland for 12 hours the last thing you want to do is get a bus back only to walk another 15 minutes through a pitch black forest to your very basic bordering on unclean accommodation. The lighting situation is disgraceful I don't know how they are getting away with it.  Trying to get up and get breakfast sorted to get out early to the park is a rush.  When going again I will definitely stay in a hotel  close by. Roll on the next visit !"
"Disneyland was as magical as you‚Äôd expect. We went with the knowledge that we‚Äôd need to prepare to queue and that there would be crowds of people. So it wasn‚Äôt a shock to have to wait 30 - 60 minutes for some rides and weave in and out the people. All staff members were friendly and helpful. If, like me, you didn‚Äôt take any paracetamol, just ask for directions to the first aid room and they‚Äôll issue some after taking a few details and your temperature. The illuminations and fireworks show is great. Expect people to be a bit push/shove and kids will go on their parents shoulders - which I understand as there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd see otherwise. My advice would be, be assertive. Just like kids, if you give an inch, they‚Äôll take a mile - almost literally when watching the end of evening show. Overall, I‚Äôd be delighted to return and enjoy some of the attractions we missed."
"Disney, who haven't seen or heard about Disney movies ? Nobody ! So why didn't you go to Disneyland Paris ? Personnaly, this park took me back to my childhood 'cause i'm a big fan of Disney ! The atmosphere, the landscape, the attraction, ... Everything was beautiful, it was breathtakingly !! So I can just advise to go to Disneyland if you want to return to your childhood !"
"We had a nice time here, enjoyed the park and the fireworks show. Managed to get on a few rides and saw some characters, plus it was lovely to see the Halloween decorations and parade. All of the Cast Members we came across were wonderful and friendly, they are always willing to help!The low rating is to do with the amount of work going on in the park itself, construction walls great you in nearly every land. Yes, the park desperately needs the work as it is starting to look very tired but there must be ways to do all this work without impacting the guest experience. While we managed to meet a few characters, we felt slightly disappointed with the amount and length of time they were in the park. After having brilliant character experience in the Tokyo Disney Parks in 2023, it felt very lacking in Paris. The other main issue we had was the crowds for the firework show at the end of the day. The crowd was so dense that we waited until the hoards of people dispersed so that we could safely exit the park. In general, the crowd control was not Tokyo Disney standards but has gotten better over the years here. One thing that I want to warn others about is not a Disney problem but a human problem is the amount of selfish, self centred guests that are in the park. Not only rude to other guests but to the Cast Members as well. I found that these rude guests ruined the magic more than anything else. Also, on our last day, we were unable to reenter the park with our Magic Pass despite paying for the 3 nights/4 park days package through Disney. Luckily, a Cast Member let us back into Disneyland Parc with no problems but we found it quite embarrassing and annoying. Would we go back? Yes! We always enjoy our time in Disney, it is a nice escape from reality that is needed!"
"Disneyland Paris is truly magical! From the enchanting rides to the stunning shows, every moment is filled with joy and wonder. The attention to detail in the parks is impressive, and the staff is friendly and helpful. It‚Äôs a fantastic experience for all ages, and I can‚Äôt wait to return! Five stars!"
"I‚Äôve been before but this time was very disappointed, many rides were closed, we had early morning passes because we stayed in the new port hotel, which was lovely, but when we entered the park at 8.30 for our hour privilege only one ride was open, flying rockets, all the rest didn‚Äôt open until 9.30 so was a complete waste of time getting up early, we had a booking to have lunch with the princesses, which cost extra money, when we got to our reservation they had put me and my husband in a different restaurant to my daughter and grandchildren, after a lot of waiting and checking our passes over and over they put us all on a table in a cove separate from the main restaurant, by which time many of the princesses had disappeared, my granddaughter was pleased with the ones she got to see but it was meant to be a treat and turned into a disaster, several of the old rides could do with an overhaul, I went 20 years ago and nothing had changed except bits missing from rides due to usage over time, in the Alice labyrinth the metal caterpillar on the mushroom obviously corroded over time and fell off, and never bothered to replace, lots of construction going on, boarding everywhere which spoils the overall magic, along with rides not working like great thunder mountain, cars breaking down on the car track repeatedly and although the hotel was lovely the swimming pool was shut, so when we got torrential rain there was very little to do, for the amount it cost us we could have gone and stayed for a couple of weeks abroad full board , but wanted to go somewhere for our grandchildren, they had a good time but it should have been magical as promised"
"No where near as good as Florida. Barely any good rides THAT ARE OPEN, especially in Marvel studios. Saw this random fight show thing that's half english half french, so I couldn't tell you what on earth was going on. I highly recommend the Avengers ride though. (THEN LEAVE) Disneyland itself was slightly better. But it was  VERY busy. Its a small world is my favourite and we went on it, but the boats are so close it doesn't feel like a boat ride, just a continual snake-like conveyor belt that goes round and round. And when we wanted to go again at only 6, we go and it says ""closed but back in 5 mimutes"" SO WE WAIT. AND WAIT. AND WAIT. an hour later ITS STILL CLOSED!!!There was big thunder mountain that was pretty good as well. There was building work so the map wasn't accurate and 2we got lost multiple times.BUT THE WORST PART WAS THE FOOD.we had a food voucher that you can only use in like 6 restaurants. It was only 5pm, but it said lots of them were closed. finally we find  one on the app THATS OPEN, so we walk all the way across the park to get to it in the rain, but guess what? ITS CLOSEDü§ØThen at 7pm we find a pizza place; but with the voucher you can only get like 2 things. I got the pizza, and after a MASSIVE QUEUE, it came and we had nowhere to sit. Then we find somewhere, and the pizza is Mickey mouse shaped. Cute, you might think, but NOOOOOOO. IT MAKES IT SMALLERüíÄDO NOT RECOMMEND"
"we bought the hotel n tickets for the parks directly on the website of disneyland paris. we LOVED it at disneyland park. if u like disney n/or amusement parks you will also like or maybe also love it. we've been at both parks in 2 days which was enough, but we've been during the week and not during the main season. waiting time at the activities was very good. didnt wait too long, 45min was the longest. we had no fast lane tickets."
"I've just came back from DLP and it was OK.  Kids enjoyed it as there was plenty to appeal to them. Im happy if they are happy. Everything else that parents deal with was a Croc of S. Parades , firework shows,and leaving the park was chaos. A real frenzy. These are areas where they can't get money out of you so it really shows what they think of you as there is no attention to make it comfortable for all. BUT these are the areas that scare the crop out of kids and stress parents out. I really wanted to enjoy and come away smiling but i felt let down and disappointed at the end of each day.I've read past reviews after my experience and I laughed at the parks caring replies to others. Saying thank you for informing us, we will do better, give us another opportunity ( at a cost to you of course) and all replies to same issues going back years...  but I can confirm the same issues exist as of Oct 24. Obviously there's been no action taken  but replies show intent ;)  Looking forward to a caring acknowledgement reply and empty promise after this. My advice, Go with eyes open. Do reseach on the little things that would make a trip of a LT. etc If you know what to expect then it won't be so bad."
Absolutely loved doing this with my family & 100% would do it again. Travelled on Eurostar  to Paris then travelled in a pre booked people carrier to Disneyland Paris. Stayed in the Sequoia Hotel on site. Lovely experience had‚Ä¶ food & rooms were both really nice. 15min walk into the park with 2x security checks.
"Goodness, this is a tough one! I LOVE Disney, and the last time I visited Paris was 2019, so it‚Äôs been awhile! DLP has a lot of sentimental and nostalgic value to me, but even I couldn‚Äôt ignore how downhill this place seems to have gone‚Ä¶I just feel like they need to spend some major money on improving the Disneyland Park, it‚Äôs so outdated now it‚Äôs almost laughable: the rides are so old-fashioned and janky, I find it hard to believe that anyone is finding them impressive these days, particularly ones like Phantom Manor and Pirates of the Caribbean with their decrepit animatronics: both classic rides with stories I love, but not fit for 2024 onwards, especially with the price tag of a Disney ticket. The parade was the same one from back in 2019 but missing several floats/dance units, very disappointing and difficult to view as it was so busy in the park! The Halloween cavalcade is one I love, but again difficult to view as it was so busy! We barely saw any characters out and about, which again was very disappointing, it honestly felt like an average run of the mill theme park rather than a magical Disney experience‚Ä¶To top it off, after we waited over an hour for the nighttime shows, in huge crowds, 5 minutes before starting they announced there would be no drone show - so disappointing as that‚Äôs the main reason we stayed! No contingency in place, it really felt like they‚Äôre riding on their profits knowing people will return time and time again, without putting in any effort to make it special anymore.Even the merch has gone downhill, the quality of products is terrible, and the range to choose from is nothing special, nothing sentimental about it - you can genuinely get nicer things from Asda or Primark these days for less than a quarter of the price!Overall a disappointment, which is such a shame as it has the potential to be incredible!"
"POSITIVE THINGS: We loved our three days at Disney and even rode rides more than once. The park has a lot of good options for all ages and some of the rides are just fantastic, very well done. Ratatouille, the haunted Manor, Spider-Man, buzz lightyear just to name a few. The lines weren‚Äôt too bad but it did rain on and off. You need a good few days in the park, it‚Äôs hard to get all rides done in one day. Have a plan when you go in so you don‚Äôt run from one end to the other, it‚Äôs a lot of walking! NEGATIVE: Lack of signage, it was hard using the app as it took you on a walk about. The food options. Some of the restaurants were terrible. We purchased the full board food plan and hardly used it as the options were limited and awful. You‚Äôd be better off going to the diner and ordering from the small food truck like places. We ended the trip with the ‚Äúit‚Äôs a small world after all‚Äù and it topped it off for us! Back to Australia üá¶üá∫"
"I was expecting a stress-free magical day given we had spent ¬£600 on tickets for a family of 4 for 2 days. Wasn't the case unfortunately. I can definitely see some evidence of where the money goes; the parks are not run down at all, very well maintained and clean. I'd imagine the daily parade and closing ceremonies are expensive to hold, and the Pixar show was absolutely fantastic. But unfortunately it was difficult to really enjoy many of the things our tickets had paid for due to the sheer amount of people they allow into the parks. At the parade and closing ceremony you have to literally fight for somewhere to stand! There just isn't enough open space for each person to stand which is a bit outrageous given both are outside, open-air activities and there should be ample room! Now I know why they try to sell you extra tickets for a VIP viewing platform for these displays. Shouldn't be needed at all! Imagine my shock when I look at a crowd calendar website online which shows the park was actually only half full when we went! What volume of people are they letting in when its close to 100% capacity?! Which brings me onto my biggest gripe, fast passes. of course they are given a fancy name (Premier Access) but is a clever way of legitimising pushing-in. Don't get me wrong, I am aware most theme parks have rolled out this morally defunct concept but its so much worse at Disneyland due to the fact you're paying 2-3x as much and should be treated like Royalty with a standard pass! To have queued for almost an hour with small, stressed, bored children to have someone sashay past you and walk right onto the ride is a slap in the face given I've saved all year for this trip. There will be people reading this thinking ""Well, they've paid for the privilege"". Yes, they've paid Disney not me or anyone else in the queue. There are rude practices that go against human nature that money can't buy your way out of, and one of those is pushing in. Long queues is an issue that Disney has created by allowing too many people into the park and they are also the ones profiting from it.On the plus side, the rides themselves were very enjoyable and magical (if not a bit short, e.g. the Peter Pan ride). And the restaurants were amazing, especially the Agrabah Cafe. Unlike some more expensive restaurants it is all-you-can-eat so don't need to worry about getting ripped off with portion sizes.One last tip: shop around for park entrance tickets. Strangely, it is often more expensive to book direct with Disney. We got ours through Expedia and had no issues"
"The first and most important point I wish to make is about Marie.  Marie checked us into our room at the Art of Marvel.  Marie was absolutely outstanding and I was beyond completely satisfied with all that she did for us.  Although we had arrived slightly early, Marie was able to have the room ready for us by the time we had checked in at reception.  Marie had additional decaf coffee delivered to the room as my mother drinks a lot of decaf coffee, additional water, and bathrobes, with slippers.  Marie was extremely professional but equally kind and considerate.  All questions that we had for her were completely answered.  The room itself was wonderful.  We had a great view, it was very clean and tidy.  I used the fitness room and pool everyday and these were both a great experience.  The gym was a good size but could benefit with additional equipment as the strength equipment was very limited.  I would also recommend an antibacterial spray and tissues so that the gym equipment could be wiped down after use.  The pool was great and I would go in the morning as it opened so that I could enjoy the calm atmosphere with very few people there.  The boutique, I felt was very limited in stock.  The restaurants for breakfast were perfect as it was never full and there was a great selection of food.  The only complaint that I have is the Skyline bar.  We  went there on October 1st, in the afternoon when it was quiet, maybe 6 or 7 people there, and ordered 3 cocktails.  It took over 30 minutes for them to be prepared and served.  This seemed to be inadequate.  The coffee was also ridiculously expensive too, 5.50 euros was far too expensive.  All in all, the experience was amazing and I would definitely consider staying there again in the future.  Walt's restaurant was a highlight also, the food was great but the service was outstanding and Lucie, our server, was extremely professional.  Lucie was friendly, courteous, and unintrusive.  Lucie was able to , against all odds, seat us at a window table so that we were able to enjoy the parade."
"Lacks the magic of Disney!   Little service, poorly run. Prices are not high so that‚Äôs a bonus. Good was good and the rides still are decent."
Otherwise pleasant time spoiled by Dapper Dan. Dapper Dan picks and chooses who he would like to serve from day to day. Such exclusionary practices do not reflect well on the Disney ethos.
"I loved Disney land paris. But there were some Problems. One problem was i am gluten free and there were not a lot of food options. Second was that some of the staff where no as friendly as others, but apart from that great trip with my kids."
"I was extremely disappointed with the Disneyland Paris experience. Our daughter is only 3 and all she wanted was to meet Minie, we stood in line for 30minutes before being informed that Minie would leave before we reach her and that the line is closed. It was her last ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of the day which meant that the trip was a bit of waste.This combined with the expected commercialisation of the park left us with a poorer opinion of the entire franchise. Instead of helping our daughter fall in love with Disney, as she did with Lego when we went to Billund, she only thinks of Disney as long lines and disappointments."
"It has 3 areas; Disneyland main theme park, hollywood studios, and Disney Village. They are all closely linked together all in walking distance of one another. It is in close walking distance to the bus station and train station too. The hollywood studios and Disney Village is undergoing a number of refurbishments which makes their visits short. The main park youll definately need at least a day to see it all. Most the rides allow small children to ride attractions, even the scarier attractions such as pirates of the carribean, and phantom mansion is fine for 1 yr olds to ride too. The queues during September were around 10-30min but seeing a character took longer. We found it easier to eat in Disney village than in the park, although we did eat in Gephettos which was good value and did great portions too. I saw some families take their own food in- it is more relaxed not so strict in Disneyland Paris as Magic Kingdom, even has ppl walking around smoking. We had an enjoyable visit and hope to make another trip someday."
"Have been to Disney parks in California, Florida -and Paris a couple of times.On this occasion came with family to celebrate a family occasion.Must say that my experience was that DLP was okay but didn‚Äôt feel the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù that have previously experienced on the past due to a number of reasons:Smoking-although‚Äùbanned‚Äù in the parks (except for specific areas) people were freely smoking and vaping around children . Staff did nothing to stop this.Long, long queues-appreciate is necessary on some rides but  2 1/2 hours to meet the Disney princesses is excessive. Most rides were 40 to 50 minutes wait ‚Äì This must be butthis must be French time because it certainly took a lot longer than that to get to the actual ride once we‚Äôd started queueing.Poor maintenance- Tripped over paving stones on several occasions that were uneven. Walking up to the castle, there was no mortar in the joints in the surrounding wall over the moat!! In several areas, things are appreciably worn and although maintenance is ongoing, It felt that some TLC was needed generally.Hoarding boards everywhere! ‚Äì Lots of areas are under construction/refurbishment which gave the feel of being in a building siteFood queues- Staff had no sense of urgency in trying to serve . For example, queued up to get some coffees at a stall which also sold alcohol. The beer barrel had to be changed and although there were three people working on the stall, they all stopped to watch whilst one of their number changed the barrel. It was pointed out to them that surely they could, carry on serving others whilst this operation was completed. They did this begrudgingly! In another shop on Main Street, I queued for about 45 minutes just to get a sandwich and a cold drink. Staff were so slow, chatting to each other and seemingly oblivious to the queue of people which was stretching right out of the door. Frustrating is not the word!Character breakfast- booked this as a special treat for our party. However despite paying for this months in advance, when we booked in at the restaurant , we were told that we had only part-paid (2 people had apparently not paid). So as not to spoil the tree, we had no option but to pay ‚Ç¨100 for the ‚Äúmissing 2 people. ‚Äú.  Having just returned home, I‚Äôve taken this up with the travel company we booked through who advised that It was correctly booked and paid for and the issue is with Disney. I‚Äôm currently awaiting a response from them. However despite these issues , the children and grandchildren enjoyed their visit- which was after all the main reason for coming. However personally, I would choose to visit Disney in Florida if we ever went again."
"Fantastic place!! Yes cues can be long..... but come on it's expected. Seen reviews moaning about rides closing, well this is health and safety no Park will let you ride when it's not safe to do so."
It is real fun for whole family. We love this adventure and time we spent there. Magic show is magnificent! We would reccomend to our friends as mondatory to visit and enjoy.
We spent the day at Mickey's kingdom! It was a magical moment despite the crowds. My girlfriend loved it! We'll be back if we ever come back to Paris.
went to Disneyland Paris and my childness popped right out loved every min of the place from the helpfulness of the staff to the rides to th end of night show that was 9th sept went again on the 28th sept still the same excellent day loved every min of it sad to go
I've been to Florida and California Disney Parks and wanted to add the Parisian experience. So gladI can say I visited!  Different from the USA in size - everything seems smaller in Europe but still a fantastic experience. Loved the day!
"I consider myself a Disney Fan and I have been to Disney World many times and Disneyland once.  I had the opportunity to visit Disneyland Paris on a whim while being in close proximity.  I figured I'd drop in and check it out.  All I can say is ""Has Bob Iger visited this park lately""?  Upon entry  I noted a lot of people just casually smoking anywhere and everywhere they wanted.  Of course, this is not permitted in the USA and I can't believe that they would allow this.  Upon entering the washroom there was no soap in the soap dispenser and the bathroom looked dirty-- many stalls clogged with toilet paper and out of order.    As we entered Frontierland, again multitudes of people just having a casual ciggy and cast members just looking the other way.  We went to Coco's for lunch which was just okay.  Of note, the lighting in the cue for the pirates is so dim you can't see anything in front of you which is a risk that certainly would not pass standard in the US parks.  There is potential for this park in that some of the rides were longer and more intense than their counterparts in the USA, but the magic was lost on cast members who wore their sunglasses on the top of their heads and leaned against the wall and just really looked like they didn't want to be there.  Actually one encounter at a churro stand the cast members were just rude as they counted their change.  Small World - again lots of people just smoking a ciggy in the cue.  The water in the attraction had coins that people had thrown into the water - probably 20 years ago that were rusting at the bottom along with ciggy butts and dirt (magic is lost).  Where is the attention to detail?  You would not see this in the USA parks.  Shout out to the cast members at tower of terror who were in character and made the ride a great experience.  We wanted to find a place to eat and so decided on Colonel Hathi's which was supposed to serve Indian food.  I ordered "" Pakora"" which was definitely not pakora.  It was a dried up cold ball of what looked to be a falafel that was dried out and gross.  What was supposed to be raita was actually mayo.  Lets talk about the ""butter chicken"" and the ""dahl"".  The so called ""dahl"" was hard and chewy and the butter chicken was watered down.  They obviously buy a sauce and then water it down.  It was terrible.  In the washroom at this place, somebody had thrown a sanitary napkin into the toilet and the peeling paper as well.  On the whole, the washrooms in Disneyland Paris were not attended to and very dirty.So to try and be positive a little bit....I can say that the lines were not long and we never waited longer than 20 minutes but on the whole it is a sad and sorry park and I would say save your money and go to Disney World in Florida or Disneyland in California.  I will note that I am not an American and do not live in the USA"
Big mountain ride when opened  was over and hour long wait to get on the ride. A few restaurants  in the park you had to have reservations  in order to eat there. That would have been nice to know in advance.  (Also you had to walk to city hall which is at the entrance  of the park not near the restaurants )to get the reservations  or hoped your internet worked and did it o n the app. Which mine didn't.
"Its Disneyland Paris with some 1990s nostalgia! What more can I write? A must do on your journey in France in all seasons. But, get your big wallet and spend a week here."
Visited Paris Disney payed 130 for two adults long queue to pass security then inside could not get any proper information from staff as there english is very poor had to queue for 70 minutes to go on ride what a joke people must be starved for entertainment invthus part of the world to put up with such overpriced venue they are allowing far too many people in avoid. The Disney in Florida is away ahead
"Have been to Disney a number of times over the years here and in the states I can safely say none of the parks are as good as what they were 10 years ago  .  Yes you do stumble across that disney feeling and sparkle but more and more like the last visits to Orlando and here . There's more rides broken down more people In the park , less sparkle higher and higher costs. Is it worth it anymore ? Probably not.  Value for money there are so many better options now . Would we go again . Maybe but not for a long long time"
I went to Disneyland Paris with my sons for my birthday we got first class tickets on the Eurostar straight to Disney I went for the fireworks night many years ago it was ABSOLUTELY brilliant we stayed in the hotel sequoia lodge and we really enjoyed it my older two sons loved the rides the smaller ones and my youngest was too young for the rides. we dined in planet Hollywood and rainforest cafe my sons absolutely loved it. On fireworks night the fireworks were absolutely breathtaking they did the last fireworks to show the Micky mouse in fireworks it really was truly amazing.I would love to take my youngest again now he is older with his brothers I would definatly recommend it.
"It is a funny old place. I am sure some will love it. For others it won't appeal. I have to admit that I didn't expect to go wild over it but I was slightly disappointed. Possibly because I had incorrect expectations. I was accompanying a group of teenage schoolchildren. I think they had a great time but my honest view is that the place is geared to a younger age-group. That might cloud my judgment in this review! I did, however,  think the parades and shows were impressive but they weren't what I was seeking most. It was the rides that disappointed me. If you are looking for white-knuckle rides, Disneyland is not the place to go. If you are desiring an (expensive) day out with your young children, you may be more satisfied.Restaurants are expensive in my view for not very much food. Gardens and flowers are beautiful. Entry and exit into the main concourse is pretty straightforward but inside it is very crowded, but I accept that we were there in high summer.I am glad I went and I did quite enjoy my day but I am in no hurry to return.One final point of commendation. I was queuing for the hyperspace mountain (decent but not exceptional) when I realised my phone was missing. I worked out where I was most likely to have lost it which turned out to be true because they had my phone present and correct for collection. I don't know who picked it up but it was good to experience some honesty and to know they have an efficient system for lost property. That was a positive experience for me."
"Disney is always great with children, and without, however this is probably one of the worst parks. Yes it has great things to do, but you can see some attractions outdated and old (Pinocchio,  dumbo, peter pan, ....) you wait 1h for a 2 mins walk on something that feels like you've seen it at any travelers fair.  Compared with other Disney parks where you get better entertainment during waiting times (not to mention you wait under the sun with barely no shades ), or more modern attractions... some waits are not worth The food is a different topic, nice restaurants (some expensive but ok you see the princesses)  , but grab a sandwich is just bad, that pretzel bread, and barely filled,  just avoid it, eat outside.I'm not sure if it is because part of staff is French but in general, big smile bad attitude and rude, i thought the unspoken rule of not breaking a hug with children was real... well it is not, if you are on a queue to have a picture with some one and then time's up, the close the place, right in your face, come back tomorrow we were told (and we were the only ones/last ones waiting).MMerchandising is very limited, no movies, books, comics, same stuff everywhere, starwars and marvel is just anecdotal. In general, I'd recommend save a little bit more, get a flight offer to Orlando and go there, 3-4 days might cost the same (prices there are cheaper) than at Disney, better attractions, better food, better weather, way friendlier staff."
Very nice place for whole family.Lots of shows and characters to meet.If you want to see everything you need to book at least two day ticket.
"Total ripoff, but at least my daughter thought it was magical, I 100% knew it would be expensive I enjoyed the park,  but didn‚Äôt enjoy the long queues also loads of the water fountains didn‚Äôt work witch was very inconvenient considering the weather, all the restaurants in the park and the Disney village are over priced, you get nothing in return for your money, the food portions are tiny I‚Äôve had far bigger, better and massive meals from weather-spoons and other local pubs in England for far less money, and i couldn‚Äôt get a pint of Stella anywhere, and take your own tea bags their ones are gross, the food prices and food portions ruined everything for us, it should have been far better considering the price of everything."
"Disneyland Paris, the most magical and happy place on Earth. Or so we thought. This Tuesday outside of the holiday season, you would expect some quietness in Disneyland, but it was such busy that most paths were not walkable. However we tried looking through this and enjoy. We got a priority pass because we had a ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù (autism). With the idea that he did not need to stand in the queues and enjoy too the ‚Äúmost magical place on Earth‚Äù.To our deep sorrow and fright, it was chaos in the queues. One has to enter at the exit or premium gates at the attractions, but not only disabled use this, as well the ‚Äúrich premium people‚Äù who paid money to have a quick entrance. This is horrific because especially autistic people have trouble standing in queues/lines, therefore they have the disability pass to skip them and let them enjoy too. These people just bumped against him like he wasn‚Äôt there, and even the lines were much shorter, there were huge lines due to these ‚Äúrich premium people‚Äù.Also the Disney employees who are supposed to be happy and make people smile and appreciated, especially disabled, didn‚Äôt smile at all, were sometimes rude, uninterested/cold, tired and had poor English language skill. There were some exceptions of employees, one which was exactly how it was supposed to be. He took us personally all the way to the front, making sure nobody bumped against us (the people who were exiting). He took care with passion and love. He was sadly a rarity in general.We ate at a ranch restaurant, where we paid ‚Ç¨108 in total. The menu choice was poor and the portions incredible small. I wasn‚Äôt satisfied and felt hungry afterwards. The weirdest thing was uneatable desert, it was popcorn, vanilla tofu, jam and blue berries, it was horrendous.The worst of the day, which ruined all completely, was the sudden closure of parts of Disneyland around 19:45-20:00, this resulted into chaos, people were forced into a single direction and only one road was open, it felt like you had to walk the entire park through to get anywhere near the Castle of Sleeping Beauty for the fireworks/lightshow. For people with autism this is disaster, and feels like the disabled are left on their own and not taken into account.For the parade there is a section for the disabled, but as well here, the absolute ridiculous thing is that it is the same spot where the premium people are put. Resulting in a crowded place full of people, the disabled (also lower wheelchairs) not seeing anything because these people are in front, and the autistic are getting overstimulated. There is as-well no place to sit and you have to stand almost 1 hour.Disney employees are pointing with their flashlight sticks in your face, why can‚Äôt they normally warmly speak to you, to hive you at least some magic feeling.The show was somehow okeyish, the lights on the castle are beautiful, as is the projection. The show is long. The drones didn‚Äôt happen because it was bas weather. A pity but well not someone can do much about.When the show ended, it was only announced in French. A million people rushed for the exit I was crushed against a fence, and the only place to escape to was a security entrance gate (which is an entrance to go into the park) and I asked them kindly and with urge if we could exit through it (there was nobody, and the station was next to it) and the man first ignored us (and our disabled child) and than said rudely we have to go back into the crowd, he pushed us. I said we have a child with autism. He just laughed and pushed us back in the crowd. Unbelievable this is the way a Disney employee treated a disabled person (and his family).We didn‚Äôt see any Disney characters the entire day, we looked for them, but there were zero.All with all, a horrific day that has been remembered by our family as the worst day in the ‚Äúhappiest place on Earth.Please avoid at all costs"
"Best themepark of the world! Feel the Magic of Life! We've been for one week in the Caribbean Beach Hotel near the Skyliner. It's fantastic to fly to Hollywood Studios and Epcot by the Skyliner. We loved to go to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom by the very well organised Lyft taxis instead of the crowded shuttle bus or monorail. Our most visited and exciting park was Hollywood Studios with Galaxy‚Äôs Edge as Star Wars fans. The Blackspire Outpost and it's Rides represent a peak of Man's ideas and techniques of realising science fiction!  Thanks to George Lucas and Disney. The new Lightning Lane system is a perfect invention that people who are willing to pay extra get all their rides they want at the time they prefer in their holidays. It's better than the fast-pass years ago and I don't want to mention the awful Genie system. The Dining Plan with snacks, Quick Lunch and just one Table Service is not bad but there should be a rethinking if guests want table service only and pay for it.The shops were less than five years ago and there were less shops with for example jewelery or crystal figures. But there were many gimmicks and things we've bought my credit card confirms üòÄ. To put it in a nutshell THIS PARK IS MAGIC and THE BEST IN THE WORLD for all ages and all interests and all occupations. Disney World Orlando, WE LOVE YOU!"
"I have been going to Disney every few years since 1978.  Always magical!  Not anymore.  We returned from there after a five night stay in January 2025 realizing the magic is gone and the Disney brand has fallen far indeed.  The customer service was abysmal.  Cast members were rude, unhelpful, openly on cell phones and completely disregarding guests in lines, discussing their conflicts with their bosses in the gift shops, complaining of short staffing, and the list goes on.  When we returned, I reached out to them by phone.  Was told I had to email complaints.  I emailed and was dismissed and told that they were glad we managed to find two positive experiences in the midst of the experience and hoped we would return.  It took two more emails and a request for a call to discuss the poor service received.  They care nothing about the guests and only about the money.  They could have cared less that their staff appeared miserable and unfriendly.  They think that their brand will carry them.  We won‚Äôt be back and for those planning an Orlando trip go to Universal Studios.  Service was impeccable.  Parks were clean.  And it is cheaper."
"I recently had a disappointing experience with Disney that has left me frustrated and dissatisfied. In January 2025, I purchased a $100 shirt at Disney World Park in Florida, but when I got home, I realized it was the wrong size. I tried to return or exchange the shirt for a different size but was informed that it was no longer eligible for a return or exchange despite the recent purchase.Being unable to swap a simple item like a shirt, especially when the purchase was made within weeks, is I expected better customer service and more reasonable return policies for a company of Disney's stature, especially given the premium prices they charge for merchandise. Not being able to swap a simple item like a shirt, especially when the purchase was made within weeks, is really disappointing. It‚Äôs a shame that Disney doesn't seem to prioritize customer satisfaction in the same way it does its entertainment and theme parks. I won‚Äôt be rushing to buy more merchandise anytime soon. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars at the Parks, the Channel, and more. Never again! This is disturbing"
"We celebrated my daughters 12th birthday at Disney. We did Magic Kingdom which was amazing and had a very classic vibe, loved space mountain, the classic castle. Our ultimate favorites were Disney Studios because of the epic Star Wars area. OMG!!! If you want everything Star Wars that is the park for you. My daughter made her very own droid!! What an experience that was, we had drinks at the Cantina and even did the smugglers run in the Falcon! Next was the Animal Kingdom, let me tell you I was super emotional when I saw Pandora, they brought the movie to life. My daughter built her own Avatar on her Birthday. They really do it special. We did the epic ride on Avatar Flight of the passage, you feel like you are really riding on Na'vi, I balled my eyes out it was so real. Highly recommend and the Na'Vi river journey. Such an amazing experience. If you are leaving from Canada and you can go through AMA travel, do it!"
"Disney parks are no longer the wonderful fun parks üòï Far too expensive, not worth the money,  and  has lost its magicüòí  The whole complexes is run as a total business to exploit as much money out of you as possible while you're there,"
Experience was great! The only thing was I wish the fast passes were a bit better. You have to reserve a fast past spot and you cant reserve anything else until you are past that time. I don't know if it was becuase we were just coming back from universal with fast passes when we could go whenever we want but just don't buy the fast passes there not worth it my best part about this trip is Epcot. It was so fun we were there for new years eve( I know it says March 2024 that's the earliest I could go in my review but we went December 2023-January 2024) and I loved the fireworks!
When you experience the delays beyond the lines for rides you will never go back. Disney operations are behind the times and they could not care less. Security guards are inexperienced and have a hard time operating the old and outdated magnetometers for the tram to get from place to place. Long lines and rude guards cause constant arguments in front of kids. Not good for the Disney future and apparently the result of typical apathy by management that have given up. Buses are constantly late and behind schedules. These delays lead to missed rides and entertainment. Kids get frustrated. Old buses and unchecked traffic lights cause these problems. Again a problem from overpaid yet incompetent corporate executives. Consider other options or get ready to get upset
"Now I know it says my review was posted in February of 2024, but I actually went in October of 2023. So, Disney was not lying. Disney is ‚ÄúThe Happiest Place On Earth‚Äù. How? Glad you asked. Friendly staff, amazing food and beverages, amazing rides, it‚Äôs amazing! If you‚Äôre ok with spending some type of money, this is the place for you. I went with my friend, but family is also recommended!"
"The most miserable place on earth! Forget the lightning passes, some rides don‚Äôt even take it. Hours of wait times for short gratification. Tourist traps at best and I live in a tourist town in South Carolina. I hope once I leave Orlando I never have to return.  As far as Disney, I did have some fun at Hollywood Studios. Everything else was awful."
"Very nice resort. However, it is outragously expensive! It's hard to find a decent priced vacation for 4 adults and 2 teens under $3000.I'd like to add that I booked Universal Studios for 2 teens and 4 adults, 2 volcano bay resort view rooms, for 7 days with photo package and 4 day parks for only $2800. However, Disney wanted to limit my resort choices and charge me over  $5000 for a standard room for 5 days and 1 park day. We will have to consider Universal until Disney has better deals. Thanks."
"Hi All!  I want to share that Marriott Bonvoy Dolphin does NOT give you the 7 day experience for LIGHTENING LANE.    Sadly it is so much extra time to link Marriott reservations to Disney tickets.   We have stayed at other resorts numerous times with no issues.  It has taken many hours to ensure all is ok.Now, I escalated to supervisor who shared all my LIGHTENING LANE RESERVATIONS could be CANCELED.   Sad experience for something that we are so excited to celebrate as a family.  It is BOTH DISNEYWORLD and MARRIOTT are VERY DISAPPOINTING with this experience."
They did not honor the Capital One cash back offer for Trip Advisor. I was supposed to receive $250 back. I wouldn‚Äôt but from Trip Advisor again.
Amazing holiday at Disney World All star movies resort with 4 park hopper day tickets. We had a blast at all of them and the Christmas decorations were amazing too
"I have poor things to say, but primarily it was clear some employees there did not like me. Even though I‚Äôm LGBTQ+, I was treated by some as very unwanted. I complained, and it was ignored. Don‚Äôt go here."
"Here is the formal complaint that I have just sent through to guest services for which I am still awaiting a response.....It fills me with great sadness that I find myself writing this formal complaint directed at a company that I had come to believe were inclusive and the most welcoming towards children, particularly those with disabilitiesWe had booked what was supposed to be the holiday of a lifetime with 7 members of my family who had travelled from the UK and Canada to spend the holiday period in Orlando Dec 2024. Prior to our departure, I had done as much research as I could with regards to how Disney in Florida could account for my sons additional needs who is medically extremely complex with both physical and cognitive disabilities. I had reached out to various departments of yours to advise that all links associated with your disability access service were not working when browsing from the UK and I was told that I could do nothing in advance to get arrangements in place and simply had to visit guest services on the day of our arrival to make the necessary arrangementsOther than thinking, we may lose a little time through queuing at guest services, I suppose I was ok with this and thought nothing more of it.Upon arrival at the magic kingdom on our first day, we were greeted with a queue of around an hour and once speaking to guest services, I was told they would need to arrange a virtual consultation via zoom to establish the support/accomodations that could be provided for my son. It was at this point that things started to go very wrong. An interview was conducted with myself and both my son that appeared to focus on why my son could not queue for an extended period of time; I went on to explain why this was physically not possible for my son due to his cerebral palsy and why cognitively this would not be possible as my son does not really understand the concept of queuing and would get upset which could lead to anger and aggression.The individual that I was speaking to on the phone quite simply infuriated me. After stating that the DAS would not be appropriate for my son I challenged him and asked him how he could make such a judgement based on a short virtual consultation and asked him how he has was qualified to make a decision about physically disabilities when he himself stated he was a phycologist. DAS was rejected and no other accommodations offered were suitable.I was simply referred back to guest services whom I continued the conversation with in person.After being told that there was no one in guest services that could overturn the decision or discuss the specifics of further, I asked to speak to a manager whom although, very understanding could not also overturn the decision. This lead to a very difficult 30 or so mins where both myself and my wife were getting very upset with how we and particularly my son had been treated which for me left me in tears as I could not believe we were having this issue with Disney. I had to ask my son to wait outside as I could also not bear for him to hear what was being said and he himself was getting upset. The manager at guest services went on to say that the DAS has been recently changed and that many customers were unhappy not only because of the decisions being made but because the decisions were being made by a separate team that no one could speak to in person which is far from ideal from a customer services point of view.In essence you had simply stated that my son was essentially not disabled enough to benefit from the DAS which I have no words to describe and again, I cant begin to explain to you how much this infuriates meWe have had many experiences of this sort in the past. We have visited Disney Land Paris on may occations whom are extremely accomodating where they essentially issue a ‚Äúfast pass‚Äù which allows my son to not queue. I had understood that the DAS scheme would offer a specific time slot for when we could entire a ride and hence we would not need to queue but this was not available. I should go on to note, that we visited Universal Studios the day before whom had offered this type of pass which did help and should also not the airline companies for example allow us to board first so that my son does not need to stand in a queue when boarding a plane. This is also something that is offered in airports were we are guided to a much shorter disabled queue to avoid queuing for a long period of time (in passport control for example) when the main queue is long. In essence, during this trip, Disney has been the only company that has not tried to accommodate the needs of my son in any way at all!I could simply not understand the decision Disney had made and quite frankly it ruined both days that we spent at Disney Parks. We managed very few rides, simply because my son could not stand or sit in his wheelchair for that amount of time. Any healthcare professional with an understanding of cerebral palsy would have understood this and we even brought documentation from Theo‚Äôs Healthcare providers in the UK that clearly stated that Theo could not stand in a queue for an extended period of time and that other considerations should be provided because of thisDisney made no effort to accommodate my son‚Ä¶In fact what we noted during our time at Disney is that there were actually very few disabled guests utilising your lightning pass or disabled queues other than elderly individuals that clearly had more physical capacity than my son when we observed them transitioning. I will go as far as to say that Disney simply seemed to be more concerned about selling lightning passes rather than accommodating the needs of disabled guests.With the process that Disney currently employs you are simply introducing more discrimination and further lack of equality amongst disabled guests‚Ä¶decisions which appear to be made by individuals that are not qualified to make such decisionsThe above is my formal complain and I expect you to take this very seriously as I am prepared to make a lot of ‚Äúnoise‚Äù about this particularly with the disabled community through social mediaThere is much you can do to improve your existing DAS process if you chose to listen and action the feedback that you are receiving from your guestsThe original manager that I spoke to at guest services offered to refund the money that we had paid for the 2 day passes for all 7 guests. The very least I expect from you is to honour this gesture but I expect far more as far as an appropriate response to this email as well as stating how you will address the issues that we faced as well as offering an element of compensation if you ever expect us to return as guests and to not escalate this even further through social mediaPlease take the above seriously and provide a timeline response that does not include any generic response!"
"It was everything plus some ! I ENJOYED every minute. I genuinely would recommend anyone, even if it's once , to go here and LIVE IT UP."
"This is our third trip to Disney (2018, 2023, 2025). The last two trips were enjoyable. This recent trip has been anything but. The amount of people being allowed into the parks is ABSURD. The wait times are out of control. For instance, frozen was a ‚Äú65 minute wait‚Äù but we stood in line for 2.5 hours before getting on. Ratouille was up to 225 minutes at one point. You have to wait forever for rides, food, and even using the bathroom. And yes, I know about the multipass and lightening lanes (which is not only another chunk of money to spend, but can be tricky to purchase if you don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôre doing on what day, and / or you are late to purchasing them and you weren‚Äôt ready exactly when they became available.Our past trips I remember cast members being friendly and generally happy in their interactions. This trip every single one of them looked miserable, and I don‚Äôt blame them. Even our kiddo who has loved past trips is over it. The most fun she had was at the pool.SAFETY ISSUE: fireworks at magic kingdom is dangerous. someone is going to get really hurt. The amount of people that are pushing their way to the front is scary. We found our spot 50 min before the show, and we were eventually pinned in by people coming at the last minute. We were pushed, elbowed, and shoved. All it takes is one person to cause chaos. The walkways to get in and out (that should have stayed clear) did not. staff couldn‚Äôt even get through. We were scared the entire time watching the fireworks and couldn‚Äôt enjoy it as we were truly looking for routes out, and bracing ourselves with all the pushing and shoving. It was terrifying.For the amount of money being spent, this should not be the case.I own the fact we came right after the holidays; so it‚Äôs a busier time of year. We expected that. But this was awful. I talked to so many other people while waiting around who said similar things. This is their last trip. The magic is truly gone unless you have A LOT of money to spend.This trip was stressful beginning to end. I never ever want to do it again. It was a magical place once upon a time, but things are not the same. It‚Äôs okay to criticize when things are getting out of control - that‚Äôs the only way it may change."
I love Disney but they have lost their way in greed.  The people and facilities are great but the crowds are to the point they take the joy out of the parks.   Over two hours for every key attraction kills the body but also takes the joy out of the trip.   I took my adultfamily to Disney and at every turn including food options were over crowded.  In my view this is the result of accountants and not park lovers leading the system.  I have been to the parks perhaps 10 times with my family and this time it left me frustrated because everything was overcrowded even the stores.
"Way too overcrowded!! This lead to anxiety for my whole family! We loved our 2022 trip which was magical but the park was strict to their capacity of people! I feel as if the staff was exhausted and less hospital this year.  In fact, one staff member was extremely rude with one of our family members as embarking on a ride. They claimed he moved a red bag from his seat which he knew nothing about. They sternly raised their voice at him and said ‚Äú Get Up!‚Äù It was so rude I thought they were acting in character. My brother stood up confused and then they realized they were wrong and then asked him to sit down. This was not the Mickey experience I have had in the past! The Workers I am sure are exhausted from the amount of people that were there to tend too and didn‚Äôt notice all the fine details like they did in 2022. My boys had special ears made by their grandmother that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 5‚Äùand this year it said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 8‚Äù to ring in their birthday! 3 years ago just about every worker said happy birthday and gave them a balloon and pin right as they entered the park. This year, nothing! I feel as if they are now putting profit over people. Sadly we will probably never go back like we said we would! This year I lost the magical feeling I had a few years ago. Just makes me sad more than anything! Also the lines were unbearably long so unless you have a lightning ‚ö°Ô∏è pass don‚Äôt expect to ride more than few rides in a day. It‚Äôs just impossible to ride them all on busy weeks like new years! We went to parks 28th-Jan 4th. So glad to be home and recover!"
"What happened to the Disney I remember from my childhood? As one online reviewer said, Disney is now a place for influencers and the wealthy elite. $200 per ticket, $30 to park, and $40 per person for Lightning Pass = little bang for your back.If you want to go on more than three rides (and not wait in line for 1.5 hours PER RIDE!). you will have to update to the ""Lightning Pass"" for an extra $40 per person. That's right, the regular $200 ticket is basically worthless, so Disney milks you for more money... and after 12+ hours in the park, we were still unable to go on all the rides.Disney lets too many people into the parks, the rides are constantly breaking down, and the Lightning pass is great ... IF you are wealthy and can afford the extra money to guarantee THREE rides. That's right, you will spend roughly $80 per ride, unless you have the endurance to wait in line for 1 - 1.5 hours PER RIDE.This makes me so sad that I think I am done with Disney after four decades of enjoying it with my parents and later introducing my own family.  There is very little value in going anymore."
"(Would give zero if I could).My advice buy a car, buy a holiday anywhere else (Universal Studios, Smithoion Museums, invest, or just save it.Having spent close to $8,000 USD for Disney World and the premier pass, for 4 days at a top hotel.My disappointment is with the overall experience, from the app (convoluted, clunky, and slow ) which you must use with the spotty park networks.  To the bad information available from Disney's own web sites (multiple maps had wrong information) to park information being wrong and then directing you to the website or app.  To the outdated Broadwalk hotel with it broken vending machines, and rooms with broken blinds and curtains and non functioning showers.  To the Magicbands that were not setup correctly and then stopped working after 1 day.To the food that comes from a can, is over cooked, and cold. But still charged a premium.To being overcharged after changing hotels and not deleting credit card information after 1) doing via their sites and 2) after calling (2 months in advance of overcharge).It is the most illogical and  expensive place  and so far away from a magical place.  Save your money and sanity."
DANGER!!!!!!!!!!! DANGER !!!!!!!!!!!!!DANGERI have just left Disney Magic Kingdom a very shocked and relieved parent!Over crowded to a level that I and several others were afraid for there children. After the fireworks we found ourselves jammed in tight with no possible escape routes. I spoke with a lady beside me trying to take care of two small children and one in a stroller who was struggling to protect her family and then watched as teenagers stepped over her stroller that had an infant in it. With no help from staff the crowd started to work together to make it safe.I was there as part of a 20 plus people family trip with my young kids all waiting to see the magic so I chose to stay when the rest of our party left within 2 hrs of arrival. Not willing to repeat this experience I went to the office to get a refund on the second day on my tickets to be meet by very pleasant staff that although pleasant point blank refused to refund anything to us. I suggested these tickets should not have been sold to people if they are not in a position to protect there guests. I was then even more shocked to be told they were running at just over 50% capacity.Shame on you and I suggest you review your safety protocols before the world get to see a headline news story!
"I took an overview of this place as I walked. Everywhere I looked I saw tidings of hate. The unhappy faces of the rushed crowd, the morbidly obese patrons waddling down Main Street, the absurd price tags on a piece of cloth with eyes. The FED has some blame there, but let's not enter that rabbit hole. Then there were the rides. I beheld a broken, corrupt and ruined political message in Splash Mountain. The once kid friendly, imaginative ride has become a tottered weed of small worth held. I witnessed the desecration of Pirates with its dismissal of humor in favor of political thinking. The once sex driven, ruthless pirates are now Gen Z alcoholic camarades. A perfect representation of our current culture really. The lady in the barrel is gone. Where is the maelstrom and the horizon? Where is the redhead at the auction? They have passed like rain on the mountain, like  wind in the meadow."
We had an eight day vacation scheduled for Disney. Any attraction you want to go to is an hour or more wait. After going to Disney for four days our vacation is over due to catching Covid. Will not be coming back!
"My wife and I were at Disney on the first day of what should have been a 2-day park hopper visit. We went to Magic Kingdom but as it was very busy, transferred to Epcot. This was where the problem happened.We decided to do the Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind ride. We queued for over one and a half hours for this ride. There was no indication the queue would be this long. We were filtered into large rooms where people were let in behind us as we funnelled through to very restrictive areas. It did not feel safe or comfortable and was very claustrophobic. This was borne out when someone collapsed in the queue. The ride was fine but had we known the queue would be this long and uncomfortable, we would not have bothered.We were really upset and put off by what happened and just wanted to leave. We didn't want to come the next day and my wife was upset as her previous visit had been so different and she was very disappointed in the organization of this ride.We went to the Customer Service and they charged us for a full day with park hopper and refunded the small balance as they said that was all they could do. We had no choice but to accept this. We went to Hollywood Studios but our hearts weren't in it and we left after 30 mins. The whole day had been ruined.Back at the hotel in the afternoon, we realised we had paid over $500 for 3 hours, most of which had been spent queuing. This seems extortionate and unfair for what was a situation created by them. We did talk to them by mail but they seemed only interested in feedback on how well they had responded: honestly, incredibly poorly. This was supposed to be the highlight of our US trip and has ended up being a very unpleasant experience. If you're looking for rides and better organisation and customer care, go to Universal instead."
"Have a family of 4.  Twin 14 year old daughters.  We‚Äôve been here 4 times plus some Disney cruises. This was by far the worst experience and I spent by far the most money.  Hotel:  Stayed at Boardwalk Inn.  Actually a decent spot if you are going to Epcot or Hollywood studios. You can walk.  It‚Äôs expensive ($1,000 a night).  On the 3rd night our plumbing (like all the plumbing) in the room backed up.  Sludge coming out of the shower drain, the bathtub, the sink.  Woke up to this disaster.  I‚Äôll give the maintenance crew credit for responding quickly.  Literally zero apology from management, discount‚Ä¶nothing.  Just gross experience. Parks:  Not sure what was going on but 75% of the rides had issues.  Delays.  Made us miss some of our lightning passesRestaurants:  overall fine.  Really expensive and not that great.  We missed the whole fireworks show at Magic Kingdom because our reservation at Liberty Tree Tavern was 40 minutes delayed.  Why make a reservation? Anyway.  Magic is gone.  The prices are up.  The pipes are clogged. Yikes guys. Go to Universal. They are not perfect either but the rides are better. Maybe they can turn it around, but this was a horrible experience overall."
Disney has lost its care and empathy. This was my 14th trip to Disney which has always been made comfortable with DAS with ADHD I find the lines a completely sensory overload. Along with time blindness and needing structure it always helped me be able to cope in my ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù. The lightning lane we purchased was awful. The times can be 8 hours till your next ride line. This time I visited got told I wasn‚Äôt disabled enough‚Ä¶ wild concept that they can decide who can cope and who cannot. It was absolutely traumatic. A really bad holiday experience. I truly wish could function like a normal human being and be able to stand normal lines but sadly my brain is not wired that way. The whole time it was so mentally painful we cancelled our trip we had booked in 2025. I will never step foot in Disney world again. Disney is no longer my one break I got from life‚Äôs struggles. Since childhood I have been Disney for life but now. Absolutely nothing makes me want to go or even watch any move it‚Äôs so triggering. So I would say if you‚Äôre neurodivergent avoid it! The simple solution would be for them to ask for medical proof as I am aware the system got abused. Genuine people are now suffering but Disney does not care. üòå All about the dollar and greed over guests comfort/experience. The bad thing is they won‚Äôt refund your tickets once you‚Äôre through the gate.. but you can‚Äôt apply for DAS as an international until you are through the gate!!
We were so excited our oldest had a wrestling tournament in Orlando the week before Christmas. We were in Disney November 2012 and the holiday magic was beyond special. We wanted our 3 children to experience it and finally remember it now that they are older. What a disappointment. Ticket prices were beyond expensive and the magic was gone. None of the special landscape and holiday decorations that filled the park. Cheap projected images on the castle. Less of everything in the park. Less entertainment. More money for everything AND less of a special experience. Truly broke this mom's heart my children do not remember the magic Disney once provided for the holidays.
Worst experience ever if you have a disability don‚Äôt come to disneyworld Das program the worst thing ever doesn‚Äôt recognise physical or hidden disabilities at all In the 29 years of visiting Disney this was our worse experience nothing magical about this trip Staff don‚Äôt care unhelpful rude sitting on a phone they have no knowledge about Disabilities at all Very expensive trip don‚Äôt waste your money coming here it‚Äôs no longer a magical experience it‚Äôs a very rude experience
"I started dating my husband in 1999. In 2000 when i was 26, he took me to Disney for the first time, our first vacation together. (He had been coming here since December 1971, three weeks after it officially opened when he was 4; he had already been to WDW many, many times). This was magical for me to say the least, as I had an unfortunate childhood and had only dreamt of going to Disney, never thinking it would come true one day. We had such a wonderful time, that Disney World became a regular thing for us (we are from NY, so time off, air travel, and resort stays were always factored in). In 2004, we got engaged on a yacht in front of MK during the Wishes grand finale. We got an annual pass for a couple of years and I started running the Disney races and marathons. They were a blast! Disney World became such a magical place for us, I eventually decided that I would like to get to Disney 50 times by my 50th birthday. Well, it happened! Shortly after i turned 50, we flew to Disney for my 50th WDW trip! We have stayed at every resort at least once, and this time we stayed at Port Orleans Riverside. We went to Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party for the first time, and we also visited EPCOT where i went on my favorite ride of all time, four times in a row, Guardians of the Galaxy. We made Disney ours. Some people don't get it. They don't have to. But for those of you who get it, IYKYK. Here's hoping you all get a piece of that happy magic we got! Attached you will see a picture of us at our first trip to WDW in 2000, and my 50th trip about 24 years later."
"I am writing as a longtime Disney devotee, who has visited at least one of the parks (often two) with my entire/extended family every single year without fail, for the past 28 years.My wife and I got engaged at the Port Orleans Resort in 1996, we honeymooned at the Caribbean Beach Resort in 1997, we brought our first child as a baby to All Star Movies in 2000...well, you get the picture.Disney parks have long been part of our lives..our two daughters have practically grown up in them.They hold so many fantastic memories for us...and I've¬†always recognised the commitment to maintaining Walt Disney's original ideals, integrity and family values.But our latest trip will be our last.For us, the magic has gone.And the charm, personality and dedication to incredible customer service has gone also.Prices have been hiked, while previously-included services have been cut.""What's the very best we can aspire to?"" has been replaced by ""What can we can get away with?""""And what can we charge extra for?""More importantly, cast members who would routinely go the extra mile for every single guest, have been replaced by an entirely new breed, who don't know the answer to your question...and really don't care.I'll give you an example.A security supervisor at the main entrance to the Magic Kingdom...older guy, with a bad attitude and a power complex.Surely the worst 'cast member' I've ever witnessed, in almost 30 years of annual Disney visits.With his attitude, he should NEVER be allowed anywhere near members of the public - he's literally a lawsuit waiting to happen.The friendly, welcoming security staff of the past have been replaced by clowns like him.Aggressive, abrasive, impatient...and absolutely charmless.I'll explain...I was looking for a smoking area outside the park, and was directed towards a nearby bench, having asked another cast member.Wrongly, as it turned out...apparently he didn't actually know where the smoking area was, and had just guessed (!).The security guard ran over, and screamed ""PUT THAT OUT!!"" at the top of his voice, scaring nearby children.When I tried to explain I had been directed to that exact spot by a cast member, he screamed even louder: ""I DONT CARE!!"", much to the horror of parents and other cast members nearby.Twenty years ago, staff of that 'calibre' wouldn't have got near a job with Disney, let alone be allowed to assume a position of responsibility.I saw him bark at several other families in the same way, just in the following minutes that I was watching him.Now, is this really the first Disney cast member they want welcoming families from all over the world, as they visit their flagship park?There was also Casey, a dim-witted bus driver who inexplicably drove off with most of the spaces on his bus left empty, leaving three lines of frustrated guests, shouting after him.And the entire Disney Guest Relations team at the Dolphin Hotel..six of them, sat chatting among themselves behind the desk.Now there was a time when we described Disney Guest Relations staff as the 'Special Forces' of Disney....there was literally nothing they couldn't or wouldn't do for you.You'd go in with a complaint, and come out with a smile.Not any more...as when I asked if any of them knew where I could buy cigars, they all just looked at each other, shrugged and said: ""No idea...""When I pointed out there was a stocked humidor less than 100ft away from them, at the Shulas Steakhouse on the same floor of the hotel they were currently in, they hurriedly tried to backtrack.""Ah yes, ask the concierge..he often finds out if anyone from Shulas comes in early with a key?""Hang on....a moment ago, you claimed not to know anywhere that sold cigars?Either way, someone's not telling the truth.Smoking is a contentious issue, and I appreciate they probably don't want smokers at their parks and resorts, hence dramatically reducing the number of smoking areas.Thats absolutely fine and understandable, but if this is the case, why not just be honest, so we can all book our holidays elsewhere?Far better this than hiding designated areas, not putting out signs, not training staff to deal with it and generally pretending we don't exist?I had this very conversation several times a day with dozens of other smokers, all of whom felt unwelcome and unwanted.The smokers are often the bill-payers, and this seems like a really good way of driving all of us and our families offsite and into non-Disney bars and restaurants in the surrounding areas.For the first time ever, we had dinner off-property every single evening on our recent trip, and from conversations with other families, this seems to be a fast-growing trend.Previously, we'd go two or even three weeks without once leaving Disney property, but this actually opened up a whole new aspect of Orlando for us.Offsite restaurants have always been cheaper, especially with Disney's dramatic price hikes in recent years, but I always considered them inferior, compared to the food and service of onsite staff, with the obvious advantage of remaining in the Disney 'bubble'.Now I find this is no longer the case....local establishments have really raised their game, and the food, service and (especially) overall value often exceeds that of Disney restaurants.The future of the company though, probably rests with the likes of Bryson, a (very) keen young maintenance assistant at All Star Movies, who told me of his lifelong ambition to work for Disney, and his undoubted pride in his new job.I wished him well, but although he definitely deserves to pursue a career in the corporation we've both admired for so long, is the Disney of today really deserving of young people like him, who are prepared to dedicate their lives to it?I'm not sure it is, anymore.I wish the company all the very best for the future, but my family and I (along with lots of others, apparently) will not be visiting again."
Amazing! Magical! All 4 parks are so great!!!!   My kids- one a toddler/ and one school aged-- they both loved it!!! So worth it!!
"The rides were amazing and the atmosphere was so fun, but some of the cast members were absolutely rude and disrespectful!"
"Staying at Disney World Resort was pure magic! The rooms were comfy and themed perfectly, adding to the excitement. The staff was super friendly, and having easy access to the parks made everything so convenient. From the pools to the dining options, every detail felt magical. An unforgettable stay!"
"Walt Disney Workd is not a family place to go. We had to few good experiences with the parks in general. You make a reservation with a restaurant and the wait is 30 minutes to get in. Disney World was so dark at night it was dangerous. Way over crowded. People are rude and cruel they will hurt your child if they get in their way. The kids can't even get out and run around and enjoy, due to how grown people act. The cost of everything is just over the top a d over priced. If you bring the "" wrong stroller"" they want you to rent these hard plastice unsanitary carts that are just as wide and unfriended to kids. They only good side is port Orleans Riverside resort was amazing and so friendly.  Even locals say don't go to Disney. Go to Universal studios. They are more kid friendly. Take the advice from locals."
"I thoroughly enjoyed our time at Disney World in Orlando.Typically, I feel quite anxious and uneasy in large crowds, but that wasn‚Äôt the case here. The security staff at the entrance were courteous and made me feel safe. I even felt comfortable leaving personal belongings unattended with our stroller in the park for hours at a time.The facilities were consistently clean, and the cast members were exceptional‚Äîalways smiling, friendly, and eager to assist. Their positivity was much appreciated, especially as we averaged walking about 9 miles each day.While the wait times for attractions can be long‚Äîthe longest we encountered was a 75-minute wait for Slinky Dog Dash‚Äîwe found ways to make the most of it. For example, we opted to explore Star Wars: Galaxy‚Äôs Edge instead and returned later to find a shorter line for Slinky Dog.The character interactions were a highlight. They didn‚Äôt just pose for photos and move on; they took the time to engage, making the experience feel truly magical‚Äîsomething I haven‚Äôt experienced at other parks.My only critique is the high cost of quick-service food and water within the park‚Äînearly double what you‚Äôd pay elsewhere. Considering the price of park tickets, it would be nice if these essentials were more reasonably priced.That said, we‚Äôre already planning our next visit. Next time, we‚Äôll be sure to bring our own snacks and refillable water bottles to make the day even better."
"Never go to Disney when they have special events going on. The $200 ticket to get you in part of the day has to be supplemented. In order to stay the rest of the day you must purchase an additional $200 ticket with a wrist band. The park is closed for everyone at 6:00 without this wrist band. I mean EVERYTHING is closed. We exited our last ride at 6:01. We needed to use the restroom before we left the park. However, we were not permitted to use the restrooms or get a drink of water without the band. We couldn't buy a coke or food or even souvenirs without the wrist band. One of my family members requires life saving anti rejection medication for a transplant.  She was refused a drink of water from a water fountain for taking her medication, since she didn't have a band. While trying to exit the park , we were asking cast members directions on how to exit. Seemed to be alot of confusion on how to exit as we continual ran into barriers.  Very disappointed in my visit to Magic Kingdom.  Obviously,  the well being of visitors is not important on the priority list."
I first went to Disney world in the 70s it was great. Great attractions short lines. Went again last year oh the crowds the unbelievable long lines. Literally over an hour wait. Yes the rides are wonderful but the cost and lines ruin it all. I will never go again   oh and if you pay even more you can skip ahead of some of the lines  that's real fair. WALT would be horrified
"Well it's Disney and I have waited a lifetime to visit. It didn't disappoint bringing back all my childhood memories and I am so glad we visited.As an adult you only need to go once to see what is there as even in mid-November it was the busiest of all the parks we visited. Try and buy as little as possible too as it is as you would expect, hugely expensive."
Disney no longer cares about kids with Autism. When I inquired about a special needs pass for my son I was denied and questioned why I don‚Äôt use more methods to equip him for crowds and long lines.
We had an old 4 day pass paper ticket that still had 2 days left on it and the Customer Service was exceptional - they swapped them over for a new 2 day pass after 33 years ... we then went on to enjoy the park again
"It's quite obvious that the Disney Parks are interested in only one thing-profits.  The lines are long, the food is at best mediocre, and the prices are way out of line.  When the waits for rides is between 40 and 80 minutes maybe it's time to close entry to the parks instead of continually letting more people pour into the parks.  In the time we spent at the parks, everyday one of the premier rides was shut down for part of the day for maintenance.  Even my 3 grandchildren who are 9, 11, and 12 commented that  the waits are not worth the time the rides last."
"Disney World was the gold standard in Theme Parks. Sadly that is not the case anymore. Many rides were closed and food just awful. Payed a small fortune to experience the happiest place on earth. Woke up early to get over to Hollywood Rise of the Resistance only to arrive and it was out of service, same at Magic Kingdom a few rides not available.Then the monorail was broken for 40 minutes sitting there just waiting and waiting. Between park passes, the hopper pass, hotel, food etc.WDW you need to do better, your guests are doing there part you need to step up your game like to the old days.Seems the Magic might be fading a bit."
"WDW was fantastic mid-end November ( apart from crowds). Temperature was lovely and the atmosphere and decorations were wonderful. Disabled adult accommodated well through DAS. Food in quick service restaurants was good value and good quality. No need to buy drinks, free water is available everywhere. Epcot was very busy at all times. Food festival finished a few days before advertised date of 28 Nov. Best day to visit Magic Kingdom was on days where it closed early for the Christmas event - lines on those days were short and you can pop in to another park when MK closes. HS and AK were both busy at all times but seats at Fantasmic could still be found within minutes of the show time starting. Transport was efficient and easy to navigate. Would recommend a visit at Christmas, at least once. Bring all your Christmas t-shirts and clothes - everyone is super Christmassy dressedüéÑThanksgiving meals were not available throughout parks but was available in All-Star Resort and was tasty and great value. Some rides did break and staff were very poor at dealing with situation. Staff not as good as summer - many chatting to each other instead of helping, especially in main shop in Epcot, and at ride entry points.Would recommend a Christmas visit to WDW."
"Better than universal, but nowhere near as good as it used to be.  Crazy expensive for what is actually provided.  Way too overcrowded for the capacity of the parks - barely impossible to move around for much of our visit, yet alone get on anything.  Staff and food were extremes of either very good or absolutely terrible (very little in between.).  Increasing changes in the parks are also dull - for example conversion of Splash Mountain to Tiana‚Äôs. Just dull, and no need to change something that was really good for something that‚Äôs average at best and spent most of the time during our visit broken down.   The shoehorning of stale movie IP into parks was also tedious.  Disney used to have imagination and use the parks as a way of creating new stories.  Now it‚Äôs all about extending the life of some pretty overused and tired franchises.   Hotel was crazy money for the quality of the room.  Transport was slow and, again, overcrowded.  Overall, Disney World isn‚Äôt what it used to be and wouldn‚Äôt be somewhere I‚Äôd rush back to again - it just isn‚Äôt worth it anymore."
Disney has gone down and is not a place I will go back too anytime soon. I will come to Orlando for the new Epic universal park though.  Disney keeps going up on prices on everything and they nickel and dime u even though u paid ridiculous amount for tickets with very long waits in hot sun to ride a 1 min ride.   I highly do not recommend this Woke company who is only for profit and could care less if u have a good time.  A lot of rides break down for long hours and some rides are down for over a year or two which means u are paying for less attractions at the same time u are paying high ticket prices regardless.   Highly do not recommend Disney and Walt is rolling in his grave on how they turned his theme park to üí©!   Go to universal for thrill rides Disney does not have any!   Disney has gone down hill majorly.
"Terrible customer service. They don't care about the customer. Was told to step aside because we were 2 people and let everyone go on jungle cruise. Then, when I was allowed in they had me sit on a dirty step and said we need you to sit there to ""balance off the boat"". When I reported this- they did not care and offered me nothing. They needed tons more chairs- no place to sit.There were too many people in park. They should limit people in park."
"We did AK, MK, HS, and Epcot in 4 days. 22.5 miles.It was exhausting but could have been much better. Epcot was the only park with plenty of bench areas. Others need serious improvements. Especially MK! The could line main street with benches. All the iron work walls and rock walls could be widen for comfortable seating.It was disappointing to discover the first line was just security which got you to another line (scanning) to another line (rope drop) to all areas of parks, to the line at the ride, which was already 45 minutes! This rope drop system is a joke and doesn't buy you anything. Sleep in. Lightning lane help a lot. Tiannas virtual queue was a joke. Pushed button and missed morning all together, got 126 in evening at immediate push. Had to check all day long to see how it was coming along which was interruptive for planning all day. One of the last groups of the day. Very little seating for the wait. Then broke down 4 times while on it. And story line was horrible. Tianna just kept reappearing from scene to scene. Skip it!!The need cart shuttle from bus transportation to entrance. Or stay in a resort with monorail service.Even with lightning lanes plan on an average of about 6 rides a day. Maybe you'll get lucky.Plan on $300 a day for 3 at quick service only.Definitely bump up to a higher level hotel rather than All Star for a better experience! Work out hard months before going unless young and active. Wait until the kiddos are old enough to remember it. Otherwise we saw tons of families struggling with strollers and the kids won't even remember.  8 to 10 is a good range."
We went with the grandkids and family.  We used a Disney travel agent which made everything so much easier.  We stayed at POP Century and visited all 4 parks.  We did the sit down meal plan which worked out great for us as we did a lot of the character buffets.  Highly recommend getting the Memory Maker you will have so many awesome family photos.
"I never imagined leaving Disney World feeling so disappointed and let down. My husband was injured while riding the Aerosmith Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roller Coaster at Hollywood Studios due to what I believe is a lack of proper safety measures. At 6‚Äô9‚Äù, he did not fit properly in the ride‚Äôs seat, but no upper height limit was posted, and the cast member failed to ensure his restraints were properly aligned. This led to him being thrown around during the ride, which, combined with mild sunburn blisters on his shoulders, caused the skin to rip off entirely.While the sunburn contributed, the injury was a direct result of the poor fit of the restraints and Disney‚Äôs failure to ensure guest safety. This could have been prevented with an upper height limit or more thorough checks by staff.The incident was traumatic for both of us. Disney‚Äôs First Aid team insisted my husband be taken out of the park in an ambulance, which he was. However, we decided not to admit him to the hospital due to concerns about medical costs. Since then, he has been in constant pain, which has severely impacted our ability to enjoy the parks.What has left us even more upset is Disney‚Äôs response‚Äîor lack thereof. Despite reaching out and explaining the situation in detail, they refused to acknowledge the safety issues or offer any compensation for our ruined holiday. They directed us to a U.S. claims number, which is incredibly difficult to access as we live in the UK. Their only response was to reiterate their no-refund policy, showing no compassion or care for the injury caused by their ride.We spent a significant amount on this trip‚Äîpark tickets, flights, and accommodations‚Äîand to have it overshadowed by an injury caused by negligence, only to be brushed aside, is unacceptable. Disney markets itself as a company that values guest experience, but this situation has proven otherwise.I am deeply disappointed, not just in the handling of the injury but in Disney‚Äôs failure to address the safety concerns that led to it. Guests‚Äîespecially taller ones‚Äîshould be warned about the potential risks. I sincerely hope Disney takes these issues seriously and improves its approach to guest safety and accountability."
"Don‚Äôt visit if you have any sort of disability. They won‚Äôt accommodate you. You also need to purchase your (non-refundable) tickets to be able to see if they‚Äôll accommodate your needs (they won‚Äôt), then you‚Äôre stuck and Guest Services and their DAS don‚Äôt care/aren‚Äôt interested."
"We visited Florida and had to go to Disney World!Came here last October and we had a great time. Now that I've been to both Tokyo Disney Land and Disney World, my conclusion is that Disney World is better in terms of attractions"
"This is a hard review for me. I love the magic at WDW and have enjoyed the past 3 visits so much that I had high hopes for the 4th.Unfortunately, Disney is no longer accessible for those with disabilities unless you stay on site and pay an exorbitant amount (upwards of $500) for the premier LL. The premier LL utilizes the same line and system that DAS previously used. We were aware of this prior and were so disappointed but decided to give Disney a chance anyway and splurge on Multi Pass LL and Single Ride LL so that we could ride at least a couple of the rides we had been waiting to try. Despite booking right at 7AM 3 days in advance, we got absolutely no return times for the two rides my kids had wanted (Slinky Dog and ROR). A cast member told me to continuously check back but nothing ever opened. So we paid an extra, nearly $80, to never get to ride anything we came for, on top of an already $600 admission for my family of 4. Our first Disney day, we did get on Frozen mid-afternoon with multi-pass but Remys never opened up. LL ‚Äúsells out‚Äù so don‚Äôt plan on riding anything unless you get the return time prior to going to the parks. The chances of the LL opening are almost 0. We even purchased standby skipper to help, which was a massive waste of money.Depending on your disability there are now absolutely no accommodations for you. We were made to believe that they added accommodations for people in the standby queue but that is not the case.This trip was our last, the magic has dried up. Money hungry awfulness has taken over. I‚Äôm sick to my stomach even writing this review.Please don‚Äôt bring anyone with a disability or disease here that cannot wait in standby queues. The only exception being, if you plan to purchase premier LL for $500 (only available to those staying at top tier WDW resorts so go your research in advance).I genuinely wish we never came this visit so we would‚Äôve had our last Disney experience be a positive one, but I suppose we had to learn the hard way and I hope this can at least be a cautionary tale for others. We wasted hundreds of dollars to have to watch our kids faces sink when we couldn‚Äôt wait in the standby line. Don‚Äôt do it. Make your own magic at home."
"I prepaid for Lightning Lane in addition to my park tickets in order to preschedule specific experiences and maximize my time in the parks. In return, Disney failed to deliver on its promise of providing those experiences at the designated times I selected - which is the main benefit you're paying extra for. This happened several times over 3 days (Frozen @ Epcot, Pirates @ Magic Kingdom & twice @ Rise of the Resistance @ Hollywood Studios).  In Epcot, when my ""Tier 1"" selection (Frozen) broke down, I couldn‚Äôt exchange it for ‚ÄúRemy‚Äù (another Tier 1 option). I was offered the ‚ÄúPixar Short Film Festival‚Äù as a possible replacement - which is an insulting replacement option!In my second try at Rise of the Resistance, when we were finally able to ride several hours after our return window,  our experience completely skipped the shuttle ride sequence from the Rebel base!  This is about half the total attraction and sets up the rest of the attraction!Disney is not forthcoming with refunds when you either can't experience the attractions you book with this service, or when they charge you full price for the ""half experience"" I got on Rise of the Resistance.  If you are unhappy, they instruct you to spend your day waiting in line at Guest Services, which almost always has long waits due to the amount of other guests complaining.Disney does offer a chat feature through it's My Disney Experience app, but when I attempted to use this to get a refund for my first missed Rise of the Resistance experience, it took 80 minutes and I was forced to chat about the refund during my expensive anniversary dinner at the Brown Derby!One thing I will mention - without the Lightning Lane service, you will spend a lot of time in line if the attraction you booked is not broken.  It's a catch-22 - and at an extra $50+ per person/per day an expensive conundrum.I had horrible experiences dealing with Disney Cast members over these Lightning Lane failures.  I will not be going back to the Disney Parks!SIDENOTE - I had much better experiences dealing with team members at Universal Studios.  I consider the Universal parks a much better option for your Orlando theme park vacation."
"I remember what Disney was like several years ago during Halloween it was great Pumpkins everywhere, this Halloween I was disappointed you hardly saw any pumpkins this year and we paid for the Not So Scary Halloween party that was a waist of money. The wait time kept being pushed back further for the parade to start and we were given out candy bags for the trick or treat we didn‚Äôt get any. And they closed the rides early. So it was a waist of a park ticket. The only good part of the Not So Scary Halloween party was the Hocus Pocus Villain's party at the castle other than that this year I was disappointed. We couldn‚Äôt do a lot of the rides cause they needed fixing which I understand that but it‚Äôs annoying when you only have one day at the park most of the rides needing repair and you can‚Äôt go on any during that day. Next time I‚Äôd rather just go to the Christmas event. Much better than the Halloween Disney. Plus for Soda and food the price has gone up way too high.The one compliment I will give out is to the staff for all the hard work they did. Thank you."
Outside there are very few smoking places. So if you are a smoker I wouldn't go they make it very inconvenient for somkers..... Very frustrating.  The smoking places are very far away......
"Dear Mr. Iger WDW losing its magic for guests with disabilities. I firmly believe Walt Disney World is becoming a less friendly place for disabled guests. Let me explain:I am a mobility and emotionaly disabled individual (I suffer from lower bilateral neuropathy as well as anxiety and OCD.) I need to ride an electric scooter while visiting the parks, and I understand that Disney has made the queues more scooter friendly, but that doesn‚Äôt make the anxiety of waiting in long lines friendlier as well. Up to a couple of months back I used to be able to get a  DAS (Disability Access Service) pass so I wouldn‚Äôt have to wait long periods of time in line, which causes my anxiety flair up and take away a lot of the fun the ride is supposed to to give me. I have been an annual pass holder for various periods of my life, but a few weeks back, when I tried to register again for the DAS I was informed that what used to be a reason for me to get it is not a good enough reason to get it currently, I was given a bunch of ways to avoid the long lines, that I consider a way of Disney becoming more disabled unfriendly.  Why the reasons that were enough a few months back are not good enough now? I have medical opinions that I suffer from the previous mentioned problems, but I was told that Disney is not able to accept medical reasons as a reason  to provide DAS. After being a loyal Disney fan for over 47+ years, becoming disabled unfriendly is making me not being able to keep enjoying Disney for the rest of my life. Obviously I am not planning to renew my yearly pass next year, what would be the use of doing so? I understand one loyal fan nor renewing an annual pass in not an economic concern for the Disney organization. But it is a very disappointing reason for a long time fan of  Disney not being able to continue enjoying one of the most exciting experiences for a very long time. Daniel Sauerteig"
"This is the absolute WORST Disney experience I have ever had. I have been coming to these parks since I was 4 years old. As a continued annual pass holder, I have always been eligible for the DAS system, due to many different physical medical conditions. I have regularly used it for years with my best friend who has also qualified for it. We both have debilitating physical conditions that are recognized as disabilities with permanent handicap placards. As today is my birthday, I wanted to go to the parks with a group of friends where we tried to go to Disney and use our DAS. We were extremely disappointed when we found out we don‚Äôt ‚Äúqualify‚Äù for accommodations. We have encountered this problem before and we have tried the alternative ‚Äúaccommodations‚Äù (if they can even be considered as accommodations). As both of us have neurological, sensory, and physical medical conditions, standing in lines in extremely crowded areas is not conducive in being able to enjoy the park. Ride swap does not allow us to be with our whole party, attraction reentry forced us to be away from our group for extended periods of time, and providing a wheelchair did not reduce physical contact with other inconsiderate guests. With DAS we were able to be with our group in a line that was less crowded and accommodated our conditions significantly better.After waiting an HOUR in the park to speak with someone in the chat, the agent was extremely rude and informed us that only individuals who are diagnosed with autism qualify for the DAS system now. When asked why mobility and neurological medical conditions are not able to qualify for the DAS system, I was met with a tone of irritation and condescension.As I know the DAS system was being taken advantage of, I understand the rules has to be changed. However, Universal is a great example of theme parks assisting with mobility disabilities, as you have to obtain physician documentation explaining why the individual needs the DAS system.Disney has made this the worst park experience I‚Äôve ever had and a very ‚Äúunbirthday‚Äù birthday. This felt like the most discriminatory form of rules and regulation. Some have said, ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be going to the parks if your condition is that serious‚Äù, but Disney has NEVER forced me to adopt that mentality, until today. I NOT be returning to the Disney parks until the Disney company enacts a more accommodating system for individuals who suffer from ALL types of disabilities."
"We had been a couple of times on our last trip so this was a do the big rides as opposed to a full day. They had the Halloween theming up and it looked really good. We first of all did the Pirates of the Caribbean and I bet you can smell the water as you read this. Next up was Haunted Manor and while in queue we managed to get virtual queue slots for Tron as that was a big win having failed at 7am. After a spot of lunch we headed for a spot to watch the parade and then went on the jungle cruise before they shut it for refurbishment. This was when the problem of Florida in August hit as a big thunder and lightening storm slowly moved into the area which lead to an hour delay due to poor weather. What frustrated the queue more was the fact that once the weather had passed it took nearly another 45 minutes to get things running again despite hot sun. After this we did the new look Tiana's bayou adventure which was as good as splash mountain had been before trying out the new DOLE whip mango and Chamoy Float with chilli lime seasoning, this got reviews of nice but bit too much chilli, hmm ok but wont have again, meh does anyone want to finish mine, to OMG thats horrible, so I don't think we will be trying them again. This set us up for the final destination of the day TRON having seen it under construction 5 yrs ago, we couldn't wait to ride it. With the cunning Disney way of this is the last bit of queue before the ride, oh no there's more being used to full effect in this line the anticipation built. The ride position was good and wow what a thrill, easily the best ride in a Disney park by a long way."
"What else can you say? Disneyworld really is the happiest place on Earth. Riding Space Mountain after all these years was definitely checking one of the list. However, Tron and Tianas Bayou Adventure were the favorites for us. Can't wait to go back to Disney again."
"We recently went to WDW, October 5-11, 2024....yes, we were there during Hurricane Milton.  My only comment I have is, we've been to Disney over 20+ times in the last 10 years.  It amazes me how many people Disney packs into these parks on a given day.  The lines for rides was ridiculous.  I don't think I saw any ride under 90 minutes!  5 years ago, it wasn't like that.  If you wanted to get on a ride, you either had to be the first one in the park or go online and sign up for a Lightening Lane time.  I never went early, but one of my family members said they went to one of the parks during rope drop, you get in early, but the popular rides don't open until the park officially opens.  So you're getting there early, just to get in line for a ride.  Crazy!  Years ago, rides would be open at rope drop.  The new Lightening Lanes are expensive.  Disney, bring back Fast Pass.  People pay lots of money just to get into the park (on top of hotel, food, etc.), the least you can do is give them the free Fast Pass back.  Although we were there during Hurricane Milton, the hotel we stayed at kept us safe (I'll review that hotel next), fed and entertained until the storm passed.  With Disney adding 2 new lands to MK, be prepared in 2025 for many rides to be temporarily closed or closed for good, and for lots of construction walls.  With those new lands, means more people.  I honestly can say, this trip was probably our last time going to WDW.  Sad to say it, but Disney is all about how much money they can make.  Sad :("
Had a wonderful time at Disney World.  I found it to be accommodating to disabilities from parking to the rides.   The staff were friendly and so willing to help me get on/off the rides.  The downside of the Disney experience was the cost of the tickets and how many kids would not get to experience it due to the cost.  However it was still Disney and me having great memories of my first going to Disneyland in 1963 and several times throughout the years.
The virtual que system is exclusionary.  The system sucks. You pay big money and may not be able to go on all rides. I will not be back.
No Magic to be had.Total upsell. 170.00 for one day ticket and 30.00  for parking. No thanks. I‚Äôll just watch videos. Total hassle for everything.walt would be appalled.
"Biggest rip-off on the planet! Walt would be ashamed! We have been coming to Disney for several years now and each year is worse. This is our last visit! Lines are ridiculous for rides, food, even coffee or snacks. They let too many people in and you spend the vast majority of your day standing in lines or weaving through shoulder to shoulder crowds just to walk down the street. They have found a way to charge for every little thing while still making it inconvenient. Disney used to be the gold standard for customer service.  Aside from the staff, who is still cheery and helpful as always, it is no longer worth the time, money or grief!"
"Oh what can I say, its Disney. Everything was magical, I miss it every day and can't wait to go back. Cast members were incredible and helpful. We had a blast! Favourite moment... my 18 year old daughter running up to Winnie the Pooh who just gave her the biggest hug ever. He's been her fave since being a baby. It will forever live in my memory :) First visit so nothing to compare it to but it's just the most magical place. Can't wait to go back!"
"This is my second experience to a Disney theme park, the first being Paris which I have to say is better for younger children.The park in Orlando is beautiful especially with the autumn decorations up but the lines to get on rides were 2-3 hours and trying to keep younger children entertained for this long was impossible. One ride had a fast track line of 2 hours 44minues. There was no little outdoor parks that we could find so children spent most of time in Disney buggy in the heat. We ended up leaving at 2pm as 2 rides were shut and only managed to go on carousel and speedway. Over ¬£1000 down for 8 of us and feeling completely ripped off by Disney experience"
"Not like it used to be. Having to pay for fast pass now is truly a let down. Even worse, the crowds are insane now. I went every year from 2017-2019 on the off seasons and the crowds were manageable. Post-covid, the crowds have become unbearable, even off season. Sad to see rides that historically were a 30 minute wait now be 80+ minutes."
"Really disappointed with the customer service. Ridiculous that they make toy verify your Florida license in person despite doing so online/. Also, the wait times on rides are ridiculously long and the toys and gear are so overpriced and they are terrible quality and either just don‚Äôt work or break in a couple hours."
"I've heard so many good things about Disney, and they were all true! My trip to Disney was amazing. Me and my friends took many pictures with the characters walking around the park, and we also went on many rides! We also spent some time to get some souvenirs like Minnie Mouse ears, and some cute bags!"
That ride is such an embarrassment for disney. So sad. No story line. No pre-ride info to set the mood. No dialogue on ride except one animated figure singing 4 words on repeat. Doesn't even have a lap bar for security it's SOOO boring. It's like  pirates of Caribbean on slow motion with no drops and someone stole all the props except the grass. Must have been designed by the CEO's son and everyone was afraid to say something.
I went on a band trip although it was pricey same with the food. We had a lot of fun on some of the rides with a lot of friends and some food. Some rides you do have to book before you go or really one Tron. We went to some rides and some other rides I don't remember the names but they were a lot of fun. We did not go to all the islands that were part of Disney but we still had as fun considering we were on one island  for a whole day. Definitely recommend if you can financially afford.
"Woot I finally got to go to Disney World, I'm sure as an adult it's a lot different than as a child. I think it's a fun place go to go if you can get passed the lines. I highly suggest if you can't walk far, you rent out the Eletric wheelchair, manual wheelchairs and baby/child strollers. Please read fine print, each part of park cost to get in. Especially with universal, didn't realize you had paid a different price to see Harry Potter area. The last thing is I had one issue with an employee (who had a poor attitude), and it was at the start of the day trying to get on to train."
You can argue that Disney doesn‚Äôt provide great entertainment and spectacular shows. The parks are amazing to look at and explore but how can they justify charging the amount they do when you have to spend 75% of your visit queuing for rides. We specifically travelled out of school holidays thinking the parks would have fewer guests. This isn‚Äôt the case. Average wait times were over an hour and the major rides had queuing suspended due to the amount of guests trying to enter. We had the optional photo package which was fantastic. The photographers and special effects on the image were great. Take your own food as the Disney food is expensive.
"When I visited Disney, everything was spectacular. The people, food, hospitality, etc. It was a lot of fun and I was able to see many people enjoy their time just like my family and I did. 10/10 would definitely recommend."
Sadly disappointing. Been her a couple times previously but this time the magic of it was killed off quickly for the whole family with over 7 rides broken down and 2 additional major rides we weren‚Äôt even allowed to que for as they were too busy after speaking with staff I was told ‚Äúit‚Äôs like a concert tickets. They sell out too fast. 40min waiting was average with 85+ with the odd 25 min one. We were unaware of the app which was set up wrong by park staff which caused us loosing hours in the parks. Completely killed the atmosphere for the kids. Chose this month as it was meant to be quieter and it‚Äôs the busiest we‚Äôve ever known it. A real shame. Only saving grace was the Star Wars rides and the Pandora one. Will say that the majority of the staff have been brilliant hence the 2 stars. very sad to see. Would most likely not come back
"Disney World is the happiest place on Earth! If you have not been, you need to go at least once in your lifetime. Throughout my childhood I have gone several times, and recently just booked another trip over fall break. Disney is an enjoyable place for all ages and has an endless variety of activities within their several themed parks. The atmosphere is filled with an exhilarating amount of joy and excitement. From the thrilling rides, to the spectacular food, it is truly a magical destination to make lifelong memories with your family and friends."
"The must do are Guardians of the galaxy coaster, rise of the resistance ride, tron, and flight of passage. The must not restaurants are coral reef, sci fi diner, and Tony's town Square restaurant"
"8 th time to the parks, booked via walt disney travel uk, let's start off with the fact there is zero magic, none. Compared to booking via the US side, you get none of the benefits.Many if the reasons to book with disney have been diluted or worse removed and the price has gone sky high.- travel from the airport,  gone.- early hr entry, gone.( half hr now...)- multiple rides off every day we were there,  break downs through the roof compared to previous visits.- booked bells castle,  the beast doesn't even stop at the table or interact with the little ones anymore.- booked vip fantasia tickets, got canceled twice .- booked and not so scary Halloween for over 100 pounds each, 90 percent of the rides were switched off due to rain, parade canceled, the only thing scary was the price and the fact there was zero refund or even a reply to email to guest services.- was 2  weeks in allstars music, staff friendly, hotel was like butlins in 34 deg heat.In summery, disney have lost reality and  take EVERY opportunity to gouge prices and customers and benefits to booking with them are non existing for UK customers. I could have got the same deal via TUI but with free airport transfers !Maintance seems to have fallen off a cliff with the huge numbers of breakdown and that's just what we encountered .Been back a few days and have booked 2 weeks in universal for next year,It's sad as we have spent over 100k over 8 visits to disney and it's plainly a cash grab now and far far less for it.Won't be back."
"Just returned from a rather disappointing two week stay at DWFL. They have already spanked you for ¬£1000s to go then want to squeeze you for every penny whilst there. Bottled water $5, bottled coke $6 small bottle. Poncho for when it rains $12 it rains every day now. Stayed in one of the resorts, paid $80 for refillable drink cups, can't be used in the parks even though owned by same company. Paid $120 each for trick n treat experience. Ended up soaking again all sweets were sodden due to stalls dishing them out being in the rain. Booked my stay 2.5 years ago. Was informed I'd qualify for the DAS pass as disabled. System has now changed to a CAST MEMBER assessing your disability requirements, I had Doctor letters, lists of medications and my specialist letters, complete waste of time. After being made to do a video call to a CAST MEMBER In front of other guests I was refused after 2 minutes. Felt totally robbed and would never set foot there ever again. It's not about magic for the family, it's about extortionate prices for run of the mill tatt.For what was paid for this what should of been a holiday of a lifetime we feel totally let down by an uncaring greedy corporation. Walt would turn in his grave at seeing what this has been driven to. We spent 2 days at Universal and it was chalk and cheese. Sorry Disney but this review is my reflection of the worse holiday we have ever had."
"They need bigger hitting rides. Most of the rides are old and un interesting. The park looks and feels dirty. The queues for the mediocre rides were long, over an hour and a lot of the wait times were vastly understated. The parade was joyful but  very short. The train ride was again  boring, you can't really see the park. Some of the commands from staff were like they were hearding sheep and got too much. The  highlight of the day was the Creme Brulee croissant in Gustovs. We lost the will to live and left the park early, not waisting anymore of our time. Hollywood Studios was outstanding and Animal Studios very good."
"Just to be clear, this one star rating is for the hotel only, not Disney World in general. We were there for 9 nights: Aug. 31 - Sept. 9, 2024. We stayed at the Beach Club, which is one of the Deluxe resorts.We were on the fourth floor in the lobby wing, room 4206. This wing is in dire need of renovation and room 4206 needs to just be closed until they correct the problems I'm going to detail.The room itself was okay. Size was large and furniture was pretty old. But the biggest issue was with the maintenance of this room. It looks like at some time in the past there was a problem with flooding in the bathroom and sink area, because the bottom of the baseboards and bathroom door were beat up and deteriorated. Someone tried to repair the damage by simply squeezing a tube of grout all over the bottom of the baseboards. The bottom of the bathroom door was peeling off and had been painted to try to conceal this. All in all, these ""repairs"" looked like they were done by housekeeping, not by qualified professionals. They had a look that you expected to see in an old Motel 6, not a Disney resort and certainly not a deluxe resort.In addition, the toilet paper hanger on the wall in the bathroom had been ripped off and repaired by simply screwing it back on and putting a little putty and paint on it, without blending it into the wall. Again, something you'd expect in a low rent motel..Don't take my word for it - look at the pictures I attached. Is this something you'd expect to see in a room that can cost over $800 per night in some months?Finally, the electric plugs in the nightstand didn't work, and the ones under the television didn't work. This leads one to wonder if other things aren't being maintained - like the sprinkler or smoke alarm?Disney should be ashamed of itself for letting this room even be rented in this condition.The bottom line is you should avoid the Beach Club until and unless they renovate the rooms. Even then, you have to wonder about maintenance in other areas related to safety."
"Money grab machine. Horrible parking, long waiting lines, borring shows. Spend money somewhere else. Trust me, this is not place for kids anymore."
"I arrived at Disney and make my way to guest services to speak to them about my disability as I have autism. I had been in touch with someone before I went to explain that I struggle in crowds of people, don‚Äôt like being touched my strangers and can become over stimulated in long and noisy lines. I was told that Disney are extremely supportive of people with disabilities and to make my way to guest services on the first day of the holiday and they could give me accommodations to help. That‚Äôs what I did. The experience was horrendous. I was told I had to video call with a third party agency who would decide if I was disabled enough to be given a DAS pass. I spoke to this person over the video call in the middle of guest services. The headphones were not working so I was having to shout into the tablet with guests around me listening to my medical history and talking about a disability I am extremely sensitive about- this in itself was very belittling and stressful. At the end of the video call they said I didn‚Äôt quality for a DAS pass as they only give it to people with autism. WHAT!!! That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm telling them I have. I offered to show my diagnosis but they were not interested. They told me I did quality for some accommodations and I could have my family queue and then join them when they are at the front or if things became too much to just leave the line. I said this would not be possible and that my family should not be split up to accommodate my disability. This is indirect discrimination. I also couldn‚Äôt leave the lines as it would mean walking through crowds of people which is actually the problem. They were not interested. I tried a second time on another video call with a different agent. Went through the whole embarrassing process again of shouting out my issues down a video call with everyone listening in and was then told I now had to speak to a healthcare professional. I did this and talked about all the accommodations I have at home to help me. Got to the end and the healthcare professional decided I was not autistic enough to qualify for a DAS pass. At this point I became very upset and thought well I may as well just go home as I won‚Äôt join queues for rides as my anxiety will be too bad. My holiday was saved thanks to two very lovely members of staff called Marcie and Brittany in animal kingdom guest services. They really sympathised with me and went above and beyond to help ensure my experience was not ruined. They could not override the decision that had been made by this third party but they did put a number of things in place to ensure the challenges I have were accommodated, meaning I could enjoy the rest of my time at Disney. I am so grateful to these two staff members. In relation to the DAS programme- this is a joke! It would appear that no one is ever granted a DAS pass and the decision whether you get one or not comes down to a 30 second conversation you have with a person who is not medically trained and has no understanding or neurodiversity. I understand some people take the Mickey (excuse the pun) but it should be as simple as a guest providing proof they have a disability and then a DAS pass is granted. The way I was made to feel, the 2 hours of stress I went through means that I am not unlikely to ever return to Disney again! Sort it out Disney- this is not very inclusive and what you are doing is actually indirect discrimination. I wasn‚Äôt granted a DAS pass as I didn‚Äôt present as autistic enough! WHAT! This is unacceptable and I will be taking this further!"
"It's always been a total rip off, but now even worse. A fool and his money are soon parted. People stand in line for the privilege of being fleeced by a large corporation. The only thing magical is how they make money disappear. Poof! Now you see it, now you don't. 1/3 of the reviews are 4 stars or less. Therefore, this clearly is not entitled to a 4.5 star rating"
"I have been going to Disney World on average of 2 times a year for the past 32 years. over the past 10 years I have been using thier Dissability Access service because I have Neuropathy in both my feet, high blood pressure and Diabetes. Disney World's DAS has changed and now I am no longer able to use the service. Just came back from vacation at the WDW resorts and didn't have the same great experience i always have. Standing in longer lines made my feet hurt and couldn't get around the parks that much. I didn't have the magic I use to have. Still love Disney wish they would go back to the old DAS system."
"I‚Äôve never been so discriminated against before. I tried applying for the DAS pass for myself because I‚Äôm a type 1 diabetic and they told me that I don‚Äôt qualify for it. Okay so when I have to wait in long lines and my blood sugar plummets from the heat and wait times, that‚Äôs not a disability that requires a pass? How absolutely rude. I didn‚Äôt choose this disease and for being a ‚Äúdisability friendly‚Äù park, that‚Äôs horse crap. So hurtful that my disability doesn‚Äôt mean their ‚Äúrequirements‚Äù"
"We have been to Disney over 50 times over the course of the last 25 years. It absolutely never disappoints. It truly is the most magical place on earth. You can do Disney one of two ways: 1) park hop and go hard at it, or 2) relax at the resort, eat, shop and go into a park once or twice. You can make it as fast paced or as slow paced as you'd like. Book it now. You need at minimum a week if you've never been."
"What can I say about Disney Kingdom? It‚Äôs the main park that you simply cannot skip when visiting Orlando. It‚Äôs the first among the four Disney theme parks, and if you have limited time, it‚Äôs the one to prioritize.The park is always quite crowded ‚Äì we visited on a day with moderate attendance (5/10), yet we still spent up to 50 minutes waiting for the major attractions. I highly recommend purchasing the skip-the-line option, but only if it includes the key attractions ‚Äì which can be tricky if you‚Äôre not a local, as you can‚Äôt buy them in advance, and the bundle of three often doesn‚Äôt include all the most popular rides. For this reason, I didn‚Äôt use it.That said, the experience remains magical. I recommend classic attractions like Space Mountain, as well as the brand-new TRON ride, which is fantastic, though a bit too short for my taste.A great alternative to reaching the park is by boat instead of the monorail, though it takes considerably more time.I would definitely go back!"
"Pretty disappointing overall - 2 week package with takeaway food option (one sit down meal per day was about ¬£70 per person per day more!). We stayed in a decent Disney resort. The good points - nice hotel, great staff generally, early access to parks means you get two rides before queues are stupid. Temperature with little cover. Transport (though see below). Clean.  Oh, memory maker - a free add on fir us - we found it great - over 500 photos of us taken by dedicated photographers on top of our own, including enhanced photos (e.g.Ratatouille mouse sat on son's hand)Negatives - FOOD PLAN - plain awful. Food in hotel was same options every day - 6 options, 2 being sandwiches, pizza (adults only), 4 options for kids - Mac n cheese (awful), breaded chicken strips, burger or ham n cheese toastie. Options in the parks was similarly awful being almost the same options. Some restaurants offered something different, but some of those didn't even do kids meals. 14 days on such limited options - not what you expect from such a price offering, nor for the quality of hotel we booked (¬£200 per day room only).Queue, queues, queues for just about all rides. Even meeting Disney characters is 35 - 45 min wait. Main rides 60 - 90 min waits - in 40C temps. Lack of shade around the parks and seating within that shade - only option is air con shops (intentionally so you spend?). Transport was great, tho because of thunderstorms we decided not to walk back round to the skyline and took a coach to our hotel (was waiting at its stop)... however the next day, we waited almost an hour at the same bus bay, marked for our hotel but nothing - asked another driver and he say they don't run unless the skyline might stop or is stopped (so we were lucky first day)... why oh why not put a notice to this effect. Gave this feedback (complaint) to hotel reception... think it went nowhere as he didn't seem to care (rare tho).  A number of rides across the parks were not working or sporadic, though we were not too affected here. Watch out for virtual queues - have to book at 7.00am, 1pm and 6pm. If you are one minute late, the slots are all gone. My real feel of Disney World is that it is about how much money you are willing to spend, lightning lanes, genie days, personal bookings (such as private memory makers, closed off viewing point for Epcot fireworks, personalised tour guides etc.).So to our final view - loved the parks, rides etc, queues and commercialisation awful, typhoon lagoon was brilliant for us (spent many afternoons there), so real positives... but the food was a deal breaker - so poor, we won't go back. Every day, food put a dampener on our experience. Even Disney fireworks can't put that right."
"We haven‚Äôt visited in 30 years, and while things obviously change we were so disappointed in Disney. There were some good things but overall the magic has gone. Hot long lines with no cover. Everything is ridiculously expensive. Old rides that need updating or changing, and constantly breaking down. The virtual queues need to go. Visiting from the UK we probably won‚Äôt be able to afford to go again, we couldn‚Äôt even get in the VQ for Tron or Tiana. We stayed for the fireworks and were shocked at the lack of organisation on leaving, it was ridiculous and unsafe. That being said the firework and light show was phenomenal. Hollywood studios was only ok, best ride was Slinky. Animal kingdom was nice, Avatar experience was good. Surprisingly Epcot was the best park, managed to get on the Guardians which is hands down the best ride I‚Äôve even been on. Lovely eatery‚Äôs, rides and scenery. We booked a package deal with TUI and if we ever manage to go again we won‚Äôt be buying Disney package tickets, just wasn‚Äôt value for money. I‚Äôd opt for buying 1 day Epcot."
"When arriving we all so excited but when we arrived it was utterly disappointing. Barely anything to do, ridiculously long queues, whole park was overcrowded and our whole family was constantly walked into, pushed by others to get to the front, everything was majorly overpriced especially just for a bottle of water that weren‚Äôt even cold. Only thing to do really was 2 rides and shopping to spend even more money for a top that was 100 dollars in literally every shop. Both kids were bored when walking around and when we went to animal kingdom we went to see the hippos and were hurried along by staff so weren‚Äôt even able to see them or take any pictures. Food was terrible - only place worth visiting was Epcot as we had a lovely time there. We have decided we will not be visiting again- we went to universal and was absolutely amazing there. Food was delicious, so much to do"
500 per person for 3 days to walk into parks and wait on lines crazy not worth it go anywhere in world cheaper I like mickey but not that much
If you are planning a trip to Disney world Florida give Tui a wide birth flight excellent but when we arrived the staff at tui had not added our dining plan so we had no food sorted as expected we had booked 4 excursions Busch gardens and seaworld and aquatica and Universal studios no one had told us where iur pick up points were no one knew we had to find out for ourselves noone told us Busch gardens and seaworld are cashless parks so we were totally unprepared it took us 5 days to sort out pick up points from the transport company with no help from tui when we did get back home and complained to the tui shop where we had booked the holiday they just did not care they raised the complaint but tui just keeps on closing the complaints with no explanation what an awful company they really don't give a toss
"Disney refused to accommodate my daughter with a documented disability. Their disability department is managed by a man named Leland who does not have a healthcare degree but makes decisions on what constitutes a disability without even knowing the diagnosis. He refused to give an explanation for how her disability doesn‚Äôt meet criteria. He pretended to bring a ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù on the line who refused to give me her name or degree, who said my daughters disability wasn‚Äôt enough ‚Äúlike autism‚Äù to qualify and that only disabilities ‚Äúlike autism‚Äù (which is an enormous spectrum of various symptoms) qualifies. Disney engages in discrimination against children with disabilities. No accommodations offered other than to ‚Äúask every cast member at every ride entrance‚Äù to allow us the timed entry that disability services and guest services denied."
Rip off disney you pay to get in 30 $ to park  thata after you pay for the tickets to get in then you have to book up lighting pass 15$ to 25$ each so if A family of say 4 that's 100 $ per ride  and then they give. You time to do what can be like 6hours away so you spend more time in the park spending more money on expensive junk  yes you can book virtual que at At 7am or 1pm on the dot but if 7.01 or 1.01 you have missed it a nd if you are lucky to get in they give. You a time like 5 or. 6hours away  so when your time to que up they let. In all the lighting paying. People in first We. Qued on stand by lane as we could not get on the virtual que because we was like pressed the que line at dead on 7am but. It come up all booked so we qued up in stand by after 90mi s in the que we got near t he front thestaff  the cast members are. Under orders to let in the lighting paying guests. So they. Let in 60 to 70 lighting que to 3 stand by que this was on all the rides  and we qued and qued to see if was was the same on whatever you went. On of course you can book other. Rides for a22$if they are avilable disney is now a total rip off
"Wow, so disappointed.Disney has been my happy place for 53 yrs, but no more. Forget about the extreme cost for tickets, now you have to reserve rides at 7am or 1pm. We'll hit the button at 7am and got ""no availability "". WHAT!Why spend over $100 to have no availabilityto ride a maybe decent ride? Granted there are only a couple new rides that require reservations but that is not the point. This plus an hour or so wait on top of it. Walt would be so disappointed to know what his parks have become.The only good thing, the staff, they are still super nice.I'm moving my money to Universal. So sad, no longer the bestest place ever."
"We had a really mixed experience at Walt Disney World. My son is in a wheel chair, and anecdotally, I‚Äôd heard that Disney was extremely accessible, so we booked a trip that had a week at Disney and a week at Universal. We stayed in Coronado Springs, a Disney hotel, which was lovely.We did try to get a DAS pass, as the accessibility information wasn‚Äôt great at each ride, and we didn‚Äôt really know if our son could get on or not until we got to the front of a ride queue. They‚Äôve probably seen a surge in requests and have clamped down on this, which put my son into a pretty broad category and meant we‚Äôd have to queue and find out if we could get on the rides or not once we‚Äôd got to the front.Our first day was at Magical Kingdom, and we waited for 45 minutes to get onto the Pirates of the Caribbean ride; however, there was no transfer option offered, and it was just too low to get my son in and out of. The staff showed little empathy, and we had to abandon trying to get onto the ride. We then had a horrible experience at Big Thunder Mountain Railroad; again, staff at the queue didn‚Äôt offer any special advice or help. We waited a long time to get on the ride. I was able to get him on but really struggled to lift him out. A Disney lead actually came over, apologised, and informed us there was a carriage at the back that we could have used, which had a transfer option (the side must have been able to fold down to allow someone to slide on and off).After day 1, I was pretty upset, so I spent hours on YouTube reviewing videos uploaded by disabled users who‚Äôd visited the other parks. This helped a little, but we still had one further bad experience where we paid $80 for a lightning lane to get onto the Avatar ride, and my son just couldn‚Äôt get on the ride, which was heart breaking because the strap wouldn't shut behind his calf.Hollywood studio's was by far and away our favourite park and there were some brilliant moments, especially when a storm trooper interacted with our son, and we loved the Tron ride, which was extremely accessible, Guardians of the Galaxy, and rides like Rise of the Resistance. Overall, we had a good time and tried to shield the kids from a lot of the above.Universal, in contrast, was a more relaxing experience; we were able to get an IBCCES Accessibility card, and they approved us for an accessibility assistance pass, their equivalent DAS pass, and we had a much better experience. It didn‚Äôt always mean fast access but meant we could get a time to return, which importantly allowed us the ability to assess the ride and walk away if it wasn‚Äôt suitable, meaning we didn‚Äôt lose hours on rides we couldn‚Äôt go on. We never wanted to jump the queue at Disney but just wanted a time slot that matched the wait time so we could return and review the rides, they did offer this on occasion but it was very rare."
Don‚Äôt waste your money on the VIP guide.  We were guided around by a competent guide who rattled off interesting tidbits of park info.  It sounded canned.  But it was the ONLY thing I liked about this. We spent most of the 9 hours -totaling a large amount of money -waiting on LONG lines.  Really???!
"I rarely write reviews but I just wanted to write this review in the hope that it helps other  hardworking families from wasting their time, effort and money in Disney World Magic Kingdom. The expression on many parents' faces was stress, frustration and feeling jipped. The park prices increased to $159 plus taxes and fees per person. We went as a family before the pandemic and I recall cheaper ticket prices with 2 guaranteed queues on rides so you could plan your whole day around it and not worry at least for those 2 rides not to wait on line for them. The lines were long for most of the rides. The park closed at 10pm and I recall it being open later one hour prior to the pandemic. This meant riding fewer rides in a shorter day. I didn't see as many photographers throughout the park compared to my last visit which was shame for families who purchased the MemoryMaker or photopass. There were rides that were closed. Bottom line- they charged for more less of everything. It was a terrible way to spend your time, money and effort. I tried to make the most of the day for the kids but after this visit, we will look at other amusement parks that offer lower prices and better value and trips outside of the country."
"This is my 4th trip to Disney World over a 20 year period and I can honestly say that Disney appears to have lost their way.  The whole set up is designed to extract the maximum amount of cash.....it's just so expensive now!  Investment in new rides is limited to Tron and Guardians of the Galaxy, which are great, but that's the only real difference in the last 7 years. The cost of food /drink on the park is ridiculous. Disney have also stopped doing refill cups, boosting the cost massively for the average family trying to stay hydrated. Mobile booking does save time, but  for the less organised the food queues are huge!Standard parking is now $30 per day, with no discount for a half day.  Disney could learn from Universal here, who offer free parking after 6pm.The new virtual queue policy makes things very difficult for families. I found myself waking up at 6:45am just to get into the Virtual Queues at 7am.  In fairness, we did join the 1pm virtual queue a few times but the boarding times tend to be late in the evening, committing you to stay in the park later than I would have liked.Unfortunately, we also ended up having to pay for lightening lane multi passes too, which is an added expense for a family of 5.  We quickly found that wait times for all of the popular rides (especially in Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom) were 60-90 mins in the standby queue, which is no joke in 30 degree heat.Overall impression is that Disney is dated and poor value for money for families. The current set up forces families to plan everything with military precision, just to reduce wait times, which is just added stress. For those of you planning to wing it on arrival, you should prepare to spend most of your holiday queuing up.All in all, we had a nice time, but for me Disney World has lost the magic!"
"This was my third visit to Disney World Florida, and I loved loved loved it! Each time I go I embrace the magic of the place. The addition of the newer rides like Tron and Guardians of the Galaxy rides were like cherry on the top of a magical sundae.   There truly is something for everyone. During this visit we were a party of 10 with our youngest of 8 and oldest of 71 and it was loved by us all. Moana attraction opened while we were there and was an instant hit with the younger members of our party. The teens loved the thrill of the GoG,  Tron, and the water parks. Yes the food can be a little pricy, as can the souvenirs, but we were lucky to have majority of the food included in our package deal and to be fair, every dish we had we were more than happy with it. I look forward to experiencing the magic of Disney again in the future especially the newer attractions that have been added since our visit, as well as revisitng some of our other beloved favourites like Avatar (love the flight ride!) Galaxy's edge (Millenium Falcoln ride, loved it!) and it doesn't matter your age, the parades and fireworks are truly stunning."
"All great EXCEPT for the virtual queue system for the best ridesWe should be allowed to queue, no matter how long the wait, NOT miss out of virtual queues (where people sign up and don‚Äôt turn up) meaning people at the park on the day do not get a chance to go on the newest and best ridesDisney - you REALLY need to rethink the queuing system‚Ä¶.really poor and penalises the honest people with young kids that don‚Äôt manage to get online quickly enough to join a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù queue Rip off merchants"
"Our family of 7 had a great time but I am docking 1 star due to the prevalent line cutting issue.I had not been to a Disney resort in over 10 years.  Went to Disney World Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Disney Studios.  We enjoyed all the parks with the exception of the long lines.  We experienced line cutting in all parks and all lines.  The ""cheat"" was as follows: a group would have one person placed in line and then  30-40 minutes later the rest of the group would use a cell phone to cut their way to the front part of a one hour line and meet up with the plant in the front part of the line.  We saw 1 up to 8 people at a time in every line using this method to cheat the wait, over and over again.  Almost every line.I chatted with a Disney rep while in line at Disney Studio and was told Disney allowed guests to leave a line to go to a restroom and when they return, a cast member would walk them back to their place in line.  Never did we see a cast member with anyone cutting the line.I have since tried to contact Disney via email concerning their line cutting issue but their response is ""eyes closed.""  No one likes waiting in 1 hour lines and the line cutting will only get worse if not addressed. I might recommend all use this cheat method to cut the line wait time, but I cannot imagine the chaos that would ensue if everyone did this."
I always heard how amazing this place is. It's an absolute nightmare. Charging $280 for a basic dinner to see a bunch of young girls dressed like a princess? Absolute expensive joke. The rides are lame and they used to have better rides at Kings Island. This place is an overrated expensive joke. The characters look like something you could buy at Spirit Halloween or a dollar general. Very poor experience at this dump. Won't waste 5 grand for this crap ever again.
Thank you for inviting my friend Grace and my girlfriend Sandra Thank you for your butt on my heart please take care of them
"We loved Disney world, it was one of only a few places that my husband was able to participate in rides and attractions with our son. Sad to say we are canceling our Christmas trip and going to stay at Universal instead because they no longer care about people with disabilities. The things they are asking individuals like my husband to do are humiliating and degrading. Either pay more money for lighting lane or wear an adult diaper‚Ä¶ very disappointing."
"We have been to WDW many times before and never had a problem, but the new DAS system is a joke! On arrival in our hotel, I contacted disability access and we had the live video chat, where I was told my daughter didn‚Äôt meet the requirements for autism. I made it quite clear that we‚Äôd never had a problem in the past, or at DLP or at Universal where we were going the following week and that she has had a diagnosis since she was 4 (she is now 14). The cast member said there was nothing more she could do and suggested Genie+ at a cost to ourselves. I sent 3 emails to disability services questioning this, none of which were replied to and also 1 to guest services, again this hasn‚Äôt been replied to. We were completely let down by Disney this time, I have never received such bad service from them."
Amazing experience ! I Always thought Disney was overrated but there is something magic about this place. My first visit here and I was overwhelmed with the place. Being a big Star Wars fan my favorite was surely Galaxy's Edge in Hollywood studios but with all the fun and magic that was experienced by my daughters (7 y/o and 17 y/o)  I can now say that What Disney World is truly amazing.  Will come back for sure.
"Well, I know that this review will not change anyones mind about visiting but here goes..We have been to Disney before and enjoyed it. However, wife has limited mobility, but will not and I mean not use a mobility scooter or wheelchair she does not want people to look at her as disabled, she can cope but it hurts. We have used Disney's visit the ride then come back after a time to go on the ride, this has been removed for adults as of the start of July. We were offered a wheelchair costing 50 dollars, a scooter costing 75 dollars or we could use the genie system for easier access costing between 30 and nearly 200 dollars.All of which made Disney more money. My wife has not got better since our last visit in fact she has gotten worse the staff really had no interest in her pain or any empathy for her conditions. We were told they would raise our concerns about her treatment in the morning meeting, dont believe they cared enough to do that.I would not have preprdered tickets for Disney if I had known how she would be treat. We went 4 times to the Disney parks over 2 weeks, the last time we visited we went 9 days.Embarrassed Disney believe that this is the way forward, hope Disney get a hold on this and start treating people as human beings instead of cash machines.Really disappointed."
"We have been visiting Disney World for years and found the company to very super supportive in terms of disabilities. However, on this visit our Autistic son was denied a DAS card and we were told other family member(s) needed to wait in line and then rung him to say get cast member to bring him to the front.  Autism comes with communication difficulties, so I cannot leave him on his own, which means leaving my daughter in line in her own. This means it‚Äôs not a family holiday - as one or more has to wait alone pretty much all day. The DAS system worked fine.. You don‚Äôt skip line, you just come back later and get to stay together as a family.  Come on Disney, get your act together and be the inclusive company you claim to be. Even wheelchair users not accepted into DAS system. My son was accepted on the U.K. disabled pass system and the US system Universal make you do, despite all the hoops and stress Disney still refuse pretty much everyone, even if you were previously accepted. We are happy to provide proof but they don‚Äôt allow you that option. Thinking I will cancel our extended family trip to Disney World and just visit Universal  or Paris who are more inclusive."
We went on a family trip on the day tiana was opening. My daughter was in a queue on her phone for us to go on the ride then all the rides were shut down they opened up an hour later but she had been put out off the queue and not allowed to rejoin. That was our reason for visiting the park that day we stayed until 11 o‚Äôclock that night the rides we‚Äôre going half empty and my daughter couldn‚Äôt get on as they said she hadn‚Äôt booked but she couldn‚Äôt book as she had been shut out then they closed it. Our restaurant reservation left us standing in the rain for an hour as they didn‚Äôt have our table ready then they rushed us out the bill was 500 dollars and the food inedible . The restaurant was so cold and we were so wet from standing outside the restaurant for a hour we all ended up with the flu and were to sick to enjoy they rest of our holiday
"My husband and I did a small trip to Disney world with our 21 and 11 year olds and will probably be our last. Lines are long, too far to walk and prices were too high. Went way over our budget in just two days."
"Disney disappointed me this time. It's frustrating to be constantly reliant on your cellphone throughout the day when you're supposed to be relaxing on vacation. The lack of clear signage in the park is a letdown, and having to schedule appointments for each ride is inconvenient. I advise against purchasing the Genie service as it's almost useless. If you book a ride that's two hours away, you can't reserve another one. If a sudden opportunity arises, you have to cancel the original ride, book the new one, and risk missing out on your preferred ride later. Disney's digital connectivity requirement lacks charging stations, unlike airports that offer numerous options. You'd have to pay $30 for a portable charger when your phone dies, leaving you stranded without access to rides or maps. The only solution they suggested is a change coming on the 24th with the Genie. This experience was so disappointing that we're giving up on the remaining two days of our four-day tickets. It's too exhausting to spend a full day dealing with these issues, heat, rain and ineffective cast members. I will say Andy at the Magic Kingdom saved me.  Our phone went dead and he had the sense and ingenuity to print us hard copy tickets and access our Genie and help us with bookings we can follow with a hard copy ticket and just knowing what time it is. Thanks Andy. The rest of the day was a mess!"
"Disney or Comcast? Based on the service at parks and resorts, I can‚Äôt tell the difference lol. I‚Äôm assuming the employees are underpaid, especially management as there has been pressure to maximize profits which will work for the short term but will irreparably harm the parks brand for years to come."
"Our recent visit to Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom was an exceptionally gratifying experience! üè∞‚ú® Despite our numerous prior visits, the Magic Kingdom continues to evoke a sense of enchantment and wonder, akin to stepping into a captivating fairy tale. üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The park offers a diverse range of attractions, catering to the preferences of all visitors, from the timeless classics to the thrilling rides.üé¢üé† #DisneyMagic #FairyTaleAdventure #FamilyFun"
"My family has visited Walt Disney World many times since our kids were little. Our first trip as a family was in 2003. What a fantastic time we had and couldn‚Äôt wait to go back! Had reservations in 2020 which was cancelled due to Covid. My daughters booked a trip for  my husband and I to celebrate our 30 th Anniversary. Was I shocked how Disney World has changed! I honestly could say I did not enjoy myself due to inflated prices, lightning lanes and Genie plus! The food was great in the past but now so overpriced and tasteless!! They cater to the DVC members but forget about their other paying customers. The magic is gone! You can‚Äôt even enjoy just watching a parade because you are constantly looking at your phone! The Magical Express from the airport to the resorts was fun for the kids and hyped them up for your trip! Not anymore! Value resorts now cost the same amount as deluxe resorts did in 2014! Really? The special things that Disney employees used to be able to do to help create the magic is gone! If you want anything special you will pay a high price for it! I wanted to do the priority seating for fireworks at Magic Kingdom but the price from 2020 (which I had reserved) to 2024 has skyrocketed!  My daughters came with us and I am glad we didn‚Äôt do the priority seating because you sat on the grass if a chair wasn‚Äôt available! I will get my wine and desserts elsewhere and watch the fireworks on Main Street while being hearded like sheep! So sad that once a fun, family friendly vacation has turned into an expensive fiasco!! Walt would be soooooo disappointed!! Shame on you Disney!! Don‚Äôt know when or if I will go back again! They lost the Magic!!!!"
"just wasted 4 days, such a waste, this is justyo make money for them, nothing to entertain. go if you want to waste money on this. basically some shops and constructions which are basically crap. food is super expensive tickets arr super expensive. they have lot of ways that we just waste our time just waiting. dont go if you want to save some precious time of your liferides are absolute crap. very small ride big queue , a bunch of idiots lining up for some crap ride. so useless i have never felt in my life. they charge for nothing."
"Disneyland Employee falls off golf cart, look it up! Disney World Warning: Passive Aggressive Crowd BehaviorDisney Staff said-- they allow people to cut the lines! Their reasoning is someone can cut the line if 1. going to the bathroom 2. need to get water 3. need to join their partySo while you wait hours in line if someone comes near you and ""cuts"" its okay in Disney's eyes, essentially allowing ""spot saves"" for unlimited amount of people. No security guards to enforce crowd control, unfortunately Disney is holding a ""let it rip"" attitude towards crowd control. There is absolutely zero safety for guests. Sadly Disney has changed, you try to convince yourself you can dodge the crowds, you can handle the lines, but in reality you can't. The entire day is set up for you to fail. The lines are 1 hour 15 min. average, no crowd control, immature parents who do not control bad behavior of their kids.Similar to Hunger Games! Buyer beware!"
"Epcot CenterWe were at the park on July 4th, 2024. The fireworks show was spectacular, however, we were not aware that the parking lot was going to be closed after the show. Consequently, we ended up going to the boardwalk which is far away from the parking lot where we had parked our car in the morning. When we realized we were taking the wrong direction, we tried to go back, but then we were informed that once we had left, we were not allowed to return. Our only option was to take a shuttle to one of the Disney World hotel resorts, and then take a second shuttle back to Epcot Center. It took us around 2 hours to be back to the parking lot. When we got there, it was 11:30 p.m., and we found a young lady wandering about the vacant parking lot, totally by herself, trying to find the spot where she had parked her car in the morning. She had gone through exactly the same experience as we did. Being terribly concerned about her safety, my husband and I asked her to get into our car, and we drove her by the security area, where she could at least find someone to walk with her until she could find her car. Epcot Center needs to do a better job informing people about what happens when you stay for the fireworks shows after the park closes at 9 p.m. In addition, there was not any signage about the two different exits: one to the parking lot and another one to the boardwalk, which has nothing to do with the park. We had a beautiful day at the park, but arriving back to the hotel after two and a half hours, when it would have taken us just about 20 minutes, was really stressful."
"I used to love Disney World Orlando as a great place to bring the kids. Now it is so expensive, it's hard to plan a trip for the family. They have cut a lot of the amenities, over charged for others. They've gotten so liberal and anti family. The last time we were there will be our last time. We've been going every 2 years for over 20 years. I won't waste my time or money there again until they stop bleeding families for every penny they can get. Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave"
"Disney family vacation has been on our list and we finally decided to go. I have always pushed back due to cost and would much rather enjoy a weeks vacation on the beach, preferably Anna Maria Island. Anyways, off to Disney we went! We stayed at Art of Animation resort inside the park. We were only at the resort during the night and spent the rest of our time in the parks. We could hop on the skyliner and go to all the parks, except Magic Kingdom. We took a bus to Magic Kingdom. The parks were crowed and we had to purchase lighting passes to avoid the long lines. I would recommend this option even though it cost more money. We had a good  vacation but man was it expensive. I don‚Äôt believe the cost matched the overall experience. If Disney was a little more budget friendly, we would make plans to go back but until then, back to the relaxing beach getaways. I say if you have never experienced Disney, go for it. Be prepared to spend a lot of money. Also, if you plan to visit all the parks, make one day just a day at the resort to relax. I‚Äôm giving this review a level 4 rating because my kids had a blast. They enjoyed each day from the moment the parks opened until the fireworks signaled the end of the day."
"Disney has lost their minds.  Park Hopper costs a fortune.  Parking is $30.  Once you get in the park and realize you can‚Äôt ride anything without waiting 60+ min, you purchase the Genie pass out of desperation.  Then you realize it doesn‚Äôt cover the popular rides but for $15-$25 more on top of all the other expenses, you can pay to ride the popular ride.  Best of luck to everyone.  Make sure you have deep pockets.  I miss the days of the ole‚Äô FREE FastPass.  Disney was a true dream back then.  Now it‚Äôs a total nightmare."
We booked months ago We visit in aug this year and without any notice Disney ah e decided to change the genie plus system to massively advantage guests staying at the resort they will get 4 extra days to Book their rides Has we known this we would have booked to stay at the resort Surely this constitutes a breach In the terms of conditions of guests who have already booked their visits Many many unhappy guests coming your way Disney.Poor planning and morally and legally questionable
"Disney is always amazing but travel there has become beyond crowded.  Staying on property would always  be my recommendation, if you can budget for that.  Pack you patience at the parks lines, lines and more lines.  Regardless  of your package purchases to help alleviate some of this.  Disney is not a Cheap vacation.  However, before this last stay, we always felt like the mouse delivered on justifying the trip cost.  Not so any more.  Value for the spend has left,  Until crowds return to normal levels and with adequate staffing to help manage it we will probably, sadly, stay away."
"Just don‚Äôt bother. Disney used to be quality in every aspect. From rides to dining to costumes. Not anymore. So many rides are ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù with motion simulations via a screen and a seat that jiggles the rider about. I could stay home and sit in a bouncy chair for that experience with a VR headset and save a fortune. Why would I stay in an overpriced noisy hotel room for rubbish food and coffee I don‚Äôt get to have UNTIL 0700 that is ridiculously expensive and weak for that matter, just to be jostled around in a chair in front of a television screen? Cheap out rides. Awful. The wigs on the costumes for the princess were laughably wretched. Party City had better quality costumes. The mermaid tail on Ariel was horrendous. This is a company that made the American theme park a destination and the costumes appear as though some soccer mom whipped them up for her children for a Halloween trick or treating party last minute while hopped up on copious amounts of candy and caffeine. The shows and parades were hilariously bad. To the point of irony. I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or laugh harder. Disney isn‚Äôt paying their employees enough for the embarrassment they have to endure on the daily to be put through for these poorly choreographed performances. Some group of CEO‚Äôs are rolling in the money while every corner has been cut in the park. It is evident from this visit. The world lost a wonderful place when Disney fell into the slow creeping catastrophe that it we walked through on our visit. If I could have a tea with whoever is making the call behind the scenes simply to ask ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I would and hope it be not be about lining personal pockets. For us to anyone looking to attend the parks, our advice is simply not to spend the money in these tight economic times. Walt Disney would be ashamed of what these people have done to his legacy. They‚Äôve turned it into a disastrous joke. Get a VR headset and save yourself the hassle."
"First timers here. stayed at all Stars movies for a fortnight beginning of March.The whole holiday blew our minds. This was meant to be a once only time, however after returning to the UK its seems we are planning to go back and do a  month  long trip!We absolutely loved animal kingdom and found it was more chilled than the other parks. Tiffin restaurant food was definitely not theme park dining it was on another level absolutely delicious. As was the Nomad lounge.  We took a bus from Animal Kingdom to the Animal Kingdom lodge, beautiful place going in the daytime it was so quiet as everyone was at the park. No queue for Donald meet and having a beautiful meal at saanna restaurant while watching a zebra eating his dinner was magical. As was sitting on the outside balcony in the oversized rocking chairs watching the animals on the savanna,  incredible. Loved epcot! Guardians of the Galaxy it a must ! Insane ride in a good way. Disney springs again was fantastic,  I could waffle on forever my holiday so I won't bore you anymore üò¥ Just a couple of tips that may help 1st timers, If your main aim is doing the parks staying on site is invaluable.  Don't be worried about the size of the parks and distance, the transport system is so good it makes easy to park hop."
"We visit Walt Disney World couple times a year. Our last visit may have been our last. all cast members we encountered at Magic Kingdom seemed very unhappy and could care less about your visit. I recently broke my ankle and had to use a scooter to get around park and transfer onto ride. Several rides the cast members so lazy they would leave my scooter at entrance of ride and not transfer to exit thus when I come off ride I had to hobble long distances to obtain scooter. One particular occurrence was on  big thunder mountain, I asked cast members to retrieve my scooter and they all ignored my requests. Completely ignored me and my request, Left me stranded, We visited Universal parks in Nov 2023 and never had a problem with cast members or handicap services. Universal much more eager to please all guest including those with disabilities. We will NOT be returning to Disney anytime near future however we are looking forward to our next visit to Universal Studios!!"
"Once inside the park, the magic of Disney was so evident. The facilities are kept so clean and well managed by the staff it truly is something to behold.  It was easy enough to avoid extremely long lines with the app and the option to fast pass.  There is truly no stone unturned when it comes to the extra effort that Disney puts into a truly mystifying experience.My very favorite was Hollywood and Vine in Hollywood Studios.  A delicious meal with frequent access to some of the most pivotal Disney characters was icing on the cake of a long whirlwind trip.The Ratatouille Adveture was the most fun amusement park ride I've ever experienced in my 47 years!The Cons:The walk from the buses!  We were a school group using charter buses and often relegated to the last parking spots in the whole facility.  Two of our chaperones had mobility issues, zero shuttles were offered from buses to tickets, and we couldn't procure ECVs until we had made it through tickets. Additionally, as someone with a chronic illness in the skin cancer family (yes, we still deserve the opportunity to enjoy venues like Disney world) the lack of covered walkways in these areas to and from the buses was highly frustrating.  There was also a sore lack of covered areas for guests once inside the park and on these three particularly rainy days, this was challenging, to say the least.While I realize that if there were more seating areas available around where the evening shows at MK and EC are displayed, chaos would abound, sitting on the ground isn't a great option and after walking around all day, it's much easier to enjoy these shows seated. More benches would be nice.For a place that does such an amazing job of offering a great experience inside, it's very tiring and frustrating to get from park to park or park to hotel."
"This place is a joke, they want you to pay extra money to get on rides quicker. When you've already spent a small fortune to even get in the park. Someone's getting super greedy over here."
"It‚Äôs very fun because here‚Äôs scary rides, fun rides, and rides for small children!I personally love this because (even though the water fountains are TRASH) I had fun with my friends, family, and random people I met while walking around. There‚Äôs good food, and fun rides. I RECOMMEND"
"We stayed in the Sports Resort. If you have young sports kids it‚Äôs perfect for them. The room was very clean , a bit small but used the space very well with a lot of storage. Housekeeping and other staff there was very helpful and nice. The quick service meals at the resort and in the parks were not good at all. I had purchased the quick service meal plan for my son and I  wished I hadn‚Äôt. Was not worth it. Would have gone to the store for WATERS , snacks, and smaller meals and ate 1 meal a day out at restaurant. Buy waters at store, the free water throughout resorts and parks is warm and not good. Staying on property is definitely worth it for transportation to all Disney properties. The busses run all day to transport guest to and from all Disney Parks, and shopping. I would highly recommend not going in the hotter months. It was very hot in June, the lines were long for the rides, and a ton of people. If you are a ride person I would recommend purchasing the genie plus to let you choose a few rides to skip the lines to wait less, especially the most popular rides ie: AVITAR, RiSE of Resistance, Guardians of Galaxy, Soaring, Peter Pan and the Roller Coasters. The Parks were all very clean, The Cast Members were all nice, I felt that Disney does a very good job with guest with disabilities, accommodation for food sensitivities and allergies. The prices for food and souvenirs are insane. Make sure to have a portable charger , very limited charging stations in parks. WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES, HYDRATE  and pace yourself, it‚Äôs a lot of walking. I wouldn‚Äôt purchase the photo pass unless you have a very large family. Overall In my case it was not worth the money spent for the Disney Vacation. If you have young children over the age of 5 ,I can see how it might be."
Disney is not the place for disabled people anymore. You are no longer eligible for disability passes for even the most severe disabilities. Go to other parks where they care about people.
"Had a great time!! Walked a lot, saw so much...wonderful family experience!! Would love to go back again, however it can be a very expensive vacation."
"The magic is dead. Replaced by overpriced everything and staff who no longer care about your experience. Go on a day with a special event like "" Mickeys Halloween Party""... pay for entire day but get kicked out early to make room for people paying a second time to attend the event. If you don't get the entire day in the park you should not have to pay for a full day."
"First time visiting since the new das pass upgrades.One of the worst experiences of my life and now feel like a 2nd class citizen with my disability.Unless you have autism or adhd and even with this doesn‚Äôt guarantee you a dad pass.I can only walk small distances due to my illness or stand for long times.This doesn‚Äôt qualify for a das pass and my wife has now been expected to cart me around in a wheelchair when it‚Äôs very difficult for her as I and a big guy and she is really struggling to do this now.Spoke to guest services about this and the usual corporate line.We understand but unfortunately we can‚Äôt help.If you have any difficulties in movement or any disability then do yourself a favour and go elsewhere, preferably somewhere that actually understands a disability."
Walt Disney world is one of the best theme parks I have been to.The theming of it all is so amazing because it makes it feel like you‚Äôre in the setting.The food is astounding and the rides are really fun and detailed.
"Walt Disney World and Bob Iger need to rethink how they charge and treat families.  We had a really bad experience at Magic Kingdom today and guest relations lied to us about our choices with the lightning lane issues we were having.  No only are we charged a lot of money for tickets but we have to pay for lightning lanes too, even though they don‚Äôt make any difference to wait times.  What happened to giving us the freedom of the old fastpass with our ticket purchase?  It worked better and cost nothing extra.We have also found in the years that we have been DVC members that the benefits have diminished to very little, we no longer get free parking at the parks or extra magic hours, instead having to be a guest at a premium resort hotel (which we failed to get any hotel for the duration of our trip, so couldn‚Äôt use our DVC points either)!!We won‚Äôt be coming back and we have decided to sell our DVC contract as the magic is gone and we are bitterly disappointed with the lack of empathy and help from guest services.Wake up Disney - you‚Äôre losing families because you are getting greedy."
"Overpriced, over crowded and no longer has the magic it once had , due to being so busy we managed about 4  rides ! God knows how much that works out per ride, we are dvc members and the perks for this have slowly disappeared as well. I think Disney need to forget about corporate greed and cut capacities down by half then at least you would stand a chance of having a good day, instead of stressing  about how much money you spent for very little in return."
Amazing weekend in Disney. The tickets are so expensive but the experience is really nice. The park looks like Disneyland Paris. We enjoyed the attractions.Chris from Chicago was the one who checked our big bags at the entrance. He was super nice and helped us repacking afterwards.
The new DAS system is horrific! They will not accommodate any physical disabilities not even Parkinson! Worst of all you have to purchase the non refundable tickets to even apply. Unless you have severe behavioral issues they will not accommodate you. They say they have more staff so you can leave the line and come back but that‚Äôs a lie. Someone has to stay in line. Therefore if you are a caregiver with just a party of 2 you can‚Äôt leave to take care of the person with you needing assistance! The only way to get faster lines is to pay for the ride and then fight to get it on the app ..
"To keep this review short and to the point I will only mention a few disappointments. But it‚Äôs still Disney so overall the trip was great. We stayed on property. 1.  The Genie Plus/LL/virtual cue requires you to get up at 7am. There is no way to prepurchase (or even know the cost) in advance. Do not plan on sleeping in even if you wanted to. Learn to use it before you go. It is complicated to figure out on the fly. 2. For us the Genie was worth it for MK but a complete rip off for HS. We only went to those parks. HS did not have many attractions we wanted on the Genie plus and the return times were all late afternoon, limiting its use. We bought the individual LL for Star Wars RoR (that was worth it). 3. MK needs to refresh their bathrooms so they are hands free. Also water filling stations would be nice. They just have old fashioned water fountains that make refilling a bottle very difficult. 4.  HS seems to have no theme. It‚Äôs a combination of Disney Jr., big box Disney and old Hollywood. There were a few rides we liked but generally did not enjoy this park as we ran out of things to do and decided to leave the park and come back in the evening for the Fantasmic show. 5. The Be our Guest Restaurant (MK) was surprisingly good. The service was great and we enjoyed most of our food. 6. The Buffet breakfast at HS was so subpar I can‚Äôt believe we paid so much for it and package that provided certain seats at Fantasmic. Overall Disney just needs to upgrade/modernize a few basic features and it will continue to take our money."
"My wife and I retired in 2023, and the first thing we wanted was an adult trip to Disney.  Made all our reservations and got there in November.  We stayed 8 days at the All Star Movie resort this trip.  We've stayed at a different spot each time we've been (7th trip, including family trips with our kids).  Long lines for some attractions, but we were used to that. We tried several new restaurants and a few favorites from past trips. (separate reviews on Trip Adivsor).  Our only major complaint was that breaksfasts in the Disney restaurants was that they were bland, dull and subpar.  The staff in those areas were always helpful and professional.  The same could be said for all the Disney Cast Members we met were pleasant, polite and very helpful.  We definitely recommend advance planning for all aspects of your Disney visit, from trasportation to and from, lodging, and a plan for visiting the parks with meal planning included.  Sunscreen, comfortable footwear and clothing appropriate for the weather is a must.  We'll be back soon."
"Second trip here (been here in 2018 before all hell broke loose in 2020). This time to celebrate my birthday. Parks are excellent. Stayed at Pop Century - Skyliners were the best. Went to Hollywood Studios for the first time.Three complaints, though. Since COVID-19 and Bob Chapek‚Äôs bad business practices (he‚Äôs canned now, thank God!), there has been some changes that I do not agree with, and one thing my mom has been complaining about is the Genie system. The system is broken: it costs money for Genie+, unlike the old FastPass+ system; you don‚Äôt get to select rides way in advance, like before you check-in; and Lightning Lane books out way too easily, making you wait in the Standby Lane for almost an hour or more! They really need to reinstate the old FastPass+ system - it‚Äôs much easier!Also, another complaint that really doesn‚Äôt affect me (we drove from Alabama), but gives other people hell: booking flights with Walt Disney Travel Company directly, and the Magical Express. Those two got the axe by Chapek (another one of his bad business practices). I really wish those two can come back, because it makes it convenient for people who just want everything in one package. Maybe even resort luggage delivery and resort airline check-in (the old vendor, Bags, went bust so I think it‚Äôs time for Disney to start providing luggage delivery and resort airline check-in on their own to replace Bags)? I hope so. It would be very convenient for those who don‚Äôt want to haul luggage on their own. I highly doubt the new Magical Express service will be complementary unlike the old one, though.My final complaint: package pickup at resorts. This really needs to come back. I went on planDisney and asked about it, and their answer seemed very promising, but I do hope it comes back for the next time I visit the resort again. If Disney can afford to bring back resort package pickup again, they can certainly bring back Magical Express and start their own airport luggage service to go with it as well.Other than those complaints, the resort is great! Got lots of birthday wishes, and the restaurants I went to even acknowledged my birthday with special desserts. You gotta love Disney! They care about their guests!"
"Just completing a two week visit to Florida, including a 14 day Disney passes, we believe that Disney has always been great for kids of all ages in terms of content in general experience of very well presented, shows and rides .However, it is worth warning people that the queues for rides during March have been horrendous, even if you are up before 7 am to be able to book lightning lines or Genie + we found it was already fully subscribed, unless you were a Disney hotel resident. Disney do not make this clear when you are booking their tickets.We paid over ¬£100 for Genie + then found we could only use it for one ride during a whole day .The fast pass system that preceded the Genie+ system was excellent and included within the (already expensive) ticket price. Plus, it actually worked! It was a very fair system that evenly distributed times throughout the day and was available to all, which embodied the ethos set by Walt Disney himself when he created the parks. Instead what we have now is an elitist system available to those staying in the Disney hotels and those that can afford to purchase Genie+ and individual Lightning Lanes. The Genie+ app itself is incredibly convoluted and complicated and requires a degree to use it even by the most savviest of technology users!Disney replaced a very simple ‚Äòall inclusive‚Äô ticket system with a very complicated system that offers different options to achiever one goal - to enjoy a ride! It has taken the best part of a 2 week holiday to understand this app! Again the fast pass system was simple and available on all rides. It seems ridiculous to me to have virtual queues for some rides and not have the ability to physically queue, Genie+ lightning lane on some and Lightning Lane on the newest rides, again creating an exclusive and unavailable access these new rides. Adding to that the restriction within the app of limiting ability to book your next ride.In addition to all,of this car parking at the parks is now $30 per day! Just greedy!With the Disney corporation now prioritising profits over the public need for an enjoyable experience it has materialised into there being too many people allowed in the parks to allow the whole experience to be enjoyable.We love Disney and have always admired the goal of Walt Disney himself to create a place for all to come and enjoy. However I can‚Äôt help but feel the parks are getting further and further away from this ethos and closer and closer to a greedy, money grabbing corporation. I certainly believe Walt himself would be massively disappointed and upset- from the Genie+ app to the astronomical parking costs ‚ÄòDisney‚Äô are getting further and further away from what the parks should be about and further from the Walt Disney ethos."
"We crushed 3 parks in one day and it was easy with teenagers. Here are my top 3 tips:1. Stay in a Disney Hotel (or check into one) - we didn't actualky stay in an official hotel but it's worth it to enter early and be able to purchase the Single ILL passes at 7 instead of 9. Don't get fooled into an affiliate. Hotels like the Drury get you early entry but NOT early purchase. 2. Start at Animal Kingdom - this park opens at 8 instead of 9 so early entry starts at 730. Arrive at 715 amd go straight for the Avatar ride. No passes used. 3. Study the Genie rules amd app - the app is everything. If used properly you don't need an expensive guide. You can do this!!! Know the order of your rides. Watch the wait times. Go go go. Here are a few more :4. Buy preferred parking - then take your car from park to park. The one time purchase transfers to each park. Keep your receipt. 5. Without a doubt buy the Genie pass. It's 29$ and if used properly you never wait and get to ride everything. 6. Our order was AK, Epcot, MK but could have easily substituted HS for the latter two."
We spent two days and managed to eke in all four parks. I came away saying I wished I could live at Disney World and go there every day. All things are possible with the proper usage of reservations and genie+
"Place is a scam for Worlds Dance.  If you don‚Äôt stay on the property you pay a $400 commuter fee.  If you stay on the property (350/night plus tax regular room) you have e to buy at least one day at a park (another $500 for 3 people) that you have little time to go to.  Pay for Genie plus to ‚Äútry‚Äù to get on a ride and find people just walking through the line.  In addition for the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù rides, instead of waiting for 70-100 minutes you pay another separate fee of $17-$25 per person because per the Disney app chat person ‚Äúthey are very popular‚Äù.  Which means we can charge you another fee if you don‚Äôt want to sit in line all day.  Bottle of water $5.50, which is cheap as well.   Asked to get a refund for Genie Plus.  That went about as well as the $8 domestic tap beer.  Person indicating because we used it ‚Äúonce‚Äù there was nothing that can be done.  While telling them 3 difference scenarios on what happened with people walking through without scanning.  They asked for ‚Äúnames‚Äù.  Yes I pay attention to the names..No not really.  I won‚Äôt get into the ‚Äúother special fees‚Äù.    I would suggest going somewhere cheaper like Hawaii.  Cheers"
"I have made several trips to WDW over the years, the last in 2019. Food prices have doubled since my last visit and the quality seems to have gone down significantly. Strollers and motorized chairs are everywhere. You jump through hoops to reserve ""lightning lane"" passes and pay extra for the privilege. I recommend blowing off WDW and going to Gatorland."
"Worst service ever. Rides keep ‚Äúbreaking down‚Äù last minute 15 minutes before closing. What‚Äôs the chance of that? It shows that the workers don‚Äôt care about the people, and only the pay. So lazy. The Frozen Ride got cancelled so we had to go later, and they wouldn‚Äôt let us in but when we told them we had a DAS they did. (They don‚Äôt want to get in trouble). They just cancelled the Star Wars ride last minute. They cancelled and said stuff ‚Äúbroke down‚Äù a few more times too.Service: 2/10Food: 6/10Price: 3/10Fun: 4.5/10"
"This review is for the Magic Kingdom. The Disney name comes with the expectation of being the best. The day we were there they had some problems that restricted our plans. Some of the rides broke down during the day but they seemed to get them open later on. It's A Small World, Peter Pan's Flight, and the Disney Railroad train ride around the park were the ones that we noticed. I know that things break but it was sad that we did not get to go on them. For the price you pay for admission and ALL the extras we expected better."
April is a great time to head Disney it's right after the spring break traffic so wait times are less.  Magic Kingdom was great all around from the food at Casey's Corner to the small and large attractions that are for all ages!  Prices for merchandise and genie+ are worth it.
"Disney is a magical place in many ways. The rides, hotels, and restaurants are, for the most part, great. My complaint which has leads me to the two star rating is that over the years they have cut a lot of the benefits from staying on site down, such as the bus transportation to and from the airport and the free magic bands while continuing to increase prices and nickel and dime you with paying to cut the line.  We are dvc members and it is difficult watching Disney slowly take things away. My other complaint is that vacations are supposed to be relaxing. Of course Disney vacations are never completely relaxing because you were running around a lot but forcing people to get up at 6:45 in the morning to make their genie plus and lightning lane selections definitely makes it much less relaxing. The technology and the technological requirements to manage your day in the park is getting ridiculous. For five days on my vacation I had to get up at 6:45 AM to book all the genie plus and lighting lane selections for our entire family. It was hard to go to sleep afterwards.My last complaint is regarding the public transportation around the parks. It seems to be getting worse, except for the gondolas. The wait times for buses at the contemporary were ridiculous  and the monorail broke down on us multiple times. I know Disney can do better and they need to reevaluate the Disney app in the genie+ system."
"Step right into a world of magic and wonder - where dreams come true! From the moment we entered the park, we were transported into the enchanting world of Disney. We spent the entire day there, from opening until closing, exploring every nook and cranny and racking up severe step counts along the way!Sure, the food was a bit pricey, but that's to be expected. And we couldn't resist picking up some souvenirs from the gift shops‚Äîthey were just too cute to pass up!But most importantly, the experience was unforgettable. My family and I created many precious memories that will last a lifetime. We laughed, played, and got lost in the magic of it all. It, indeed, was a trip to remember!"
"Take nothing away from WDW - it remains a great vacation spot, but ‚Ä¶.Having spent the past 6 days at all the parks I have a number of observations/ conclusions:1. Don‚Äôt both with Genie+ as you need to buy it before you know what availability you can get and you can‚Äôt book next attraction until you are on the first ride . We booked our first ride 12 seconds after the 7 am start and got our first slot at 1130 . By the time you can book your second ride times are into the late afternoon / early evening. Ok if adults but no good if you have young children 2 . WDW is packing more and more punters in who are already paying hefty admission ticket prices in the knowledge that you are unlikely to do more than 2-3 popular rides in a day . Conclusion - don‚Äôt expect to spend any more than 60 mins on attractions out of an average day of 10 hours. 3. Lightening lane guests have huge advantage ( they have of course paid for it ) . Stood for 109 mins at Frozen attraction in Epcot and would estimate that lightening lane guest through put was 100 times than of standby guests. 4. WDW have made their App all inclusive which is great if you are there for long stays or an IT guru. The App is confusing and over complicated. In conclusion I would say that WDW has undoubtedly put profit ahead of guest satisfaction and this will remain until large enough numbers of guests make their view known ."
I have been to disney many times.  I have always loved it. Walt is crying in his grave today. Get rid of everyone running the place and get back to family values. DISNEY YOU SUCK!!!
"We paid for Disney Gene+, We paid for individual Lighting Lanes, We got there early, We stayed late. I have gone to Disney many times but now all the Magic is gone.  Disney Gene+ was $35 and we got to choose TWO RIDES. Only One of those choice was what I wanted. Second one ???? there is no other good choice left as everything was sold out. We started making choices from 7AM (earliest possible time) and still could not even chose TWO rides of my choice. Disney over sold Gene+ and with that we simply could not get the ride we wanted even with extra pay $$$$. Some line up exceeded waiting time of three hours. We paid $25 per person for Rise of Resistance at Hollywood Studio. We were given 8:30-9:30 slot which conflicted with firework time. We were finally on the ride and it stopped. We had to get off the ride and walk down the stairs. With some fight, we got park hopper ticket to come back next day. Customer Relation told us we got $400 upgrade but I argued what actual benefit did I get at all when I didn't intent to come back to that park next day and now I have to spend extra time to come back and waste time. Park Hopper is not upgrade if I never intended to Hop."
Too crowded and too long wait time. Disney could have done much better if organization was better. Disney does not value quality and inovation anymore
"I have been going to WDW since it first opened in the 70s.  The last two times the magic was gone. Wait times are beyond excessive, ticket and food prices ar3 ridiculous. Genie+ is a joke and huge waste of money."
"Good points - parks are pristine, kept so clean and they truly are beautiful.Staff mostly very attentive, helpful and welcoming - the UK could learn a thing or two here! The hotel bus stops are staffed at night meaning people queue jumping won‚Äôt away with it - I don‚Äôt think they have staff manning the bus stops in Paris, and it‚Äôs a free for all.  Not good.  No smoking in the parks.  I‚Äôm sure they have this rule in Paris but it‚Äôs not enforced and there‚Äôs people smoking everywhere.  Not a single person smoking in Florida.We arrived very late for our reservation at chef mickey and instead of flat out telling us we‚Äôd lost our reservation (like they would in the UK), they said they were glad we made it in the end and showed us to our table.  The buffet breakfast was great as was the service from our waitress.Use the app to keep an eye on queue times for each ride.  ONE afternoon we got lucky and managed 7 rides in magic kingdom.Not so great points -People using mobility scooters get to jump the queue at the hotel bus stops.  Very unfair as the people we saw using scooters were overweight not necessarily disabled.  Yet we saw a genuinely disabled person who evidently had a leg disfigurement, stood in a massive queue but because they hadn‚Äôt hired themselves a scooter, they were completely overlooked.  Not all disabilities are visible either Disney! Also, what about really young children late at night, waiting ages in a queue because these mobility scooters keep turning up and being given first dibs.  Each scooter took up about three seats on the bus.  This really caused a lot of disgruntlement in the queues.  Also, what if we all decided to hire a mobility scooter! As beautiful and magical as the parks are, they are so busy and the ride queues that long, Disney becomes just another regular theme park.  After already spending a fortune booking our holiday, we then ended up having to fork out for fast passes but because of how genie plus works, we still only got on 3-4 rides a day!!! And talking of money, be prepared to shell out, it‚Äôs tip, tip, tip in America, even the bar staff when ordering a drink! We have visited Paris a few times and  a lot of what we saw in Florida was just replicated.  There were some things we thought were better in Paris eg space mountain ride.  We stayed at all star music resort.  Rooms were okay but bathroom desperately small for a family for 1 week and tiny black bugs on the floor every day.  Other guests at times literally had zero consideration.  One morning at 6.30 we were woken by another guest loudly having a conversation on the phone right outside our door about the slinky ride‚Ä¶when I opened the door to ask her to be quiet she apologised as she obviously thought she was outside another room but still, the volume at 6.30am!!! Same late at night past 11pm, zero consideration.  Disney turns some people into frantic zombies.We would definitely return to Florida, probably not Disney unless they did something about the sheer amount of people they let in each day.  It‚Äôs like having the magic at your fingertips but you can‚Äôt actually get to any of it.  Such a shame."
This is the worst vacation my family has taken. The water park was closed for customers not staying at the Disney resorts without any notice. This left my family stranded at Disney Spring since there is no direct transit to Typhoon. I suggest not wasting the money for this water park at min. My family will never go to any Disney park in the future. The whole experience of trying to deal with this was oh sorry but we cannot do anything.
"I rode the Jungle Cruise (which I would not reveal) at Magic Kingdom with a little child. Towards the end of the cruise, while the boat was stopped for a while, the female boat captain started asking the guests where they were from. When she asked us and I replied that we were from Korea, she sarcastically said, ""Phew, I‚Äôve never even heard of such a country."" My child seemed not to hear that and another guest nearby offered me words of comfort. I felt quite upset, but didn‚Äôt responded to that comment.I think that staffs at Disney should not ask such a question and reply in such a rude way if they know only a small number of countries in the world."
"Very disappointing and expensive visit . I visited with my two 11year old boys  and there wasn‚Äôt  enough of the bigger rides/coasters they were interested in. Long wait times, poor queue management (compared to Universal) and  despite the well choreographed shows, it missed the  engagement and any wow factor. Good points were that when we finally did get on some of the bigger rides, Star Wars was great along with Guardians of the Galaxy and Test Track. Bad points, long queues, parks are way too far apart (although skyrider service did help but doesn‚Äôt connect to all parks) Orlando and wider surrounding areas are a wonderful place with so much more to offer. We left Disney feeling cheated and disappointed. Never again. Overcrowded, overpriced and overrated."
The place where dreams come true. From entering the park to leaving it felt like you were in the magical world of Disney. We entered the park at opening and left at closing clocking up some serious step counts when we were there. The food is pricey but you expect that. The usual tat was brought from the gift shops. The family loved it and created those special family moments that will last a lifetime.
"We visited Disney in Oct 23 2023. As the title says , months later and it still hurts.Please Please keep your money, sanity and family relationships, stay away.I have visited Disney many times over the course of 45 years. This last visit, proved all negative comments true. It is all a money grab with no value.You pay through the nose for crappy foods, to skip the line (genie plus), wait for rides that don't work, fights crowds, try to dodge many people who are drunk while security only engages you for trying to get on rides that you spend thousands trying to get on.Line up, hand over your wallet and don't expect service or value.You have been warned."
"Waits are killing , Rides too few . Universal is much better. For teenagers it's worst place as nothing is there and for 260$ much better options exists"
We had an absolutely fabulous time at the princess lunch and the rides that day. The following day my granddaughter got sick and they refused to give money back only saying we could use it the next day but we were flying home the next day.. I'm not sure if there is still that days money on the cards they gave us at the gate that we could use in the future.
"We used to love visiting Disneyland in LA, and we have been to Disneyland Paris a few times, so we were so looking forward to Disney World.To say it was a let down, was an understatement. For a start it is too big, big is not always best and this certainly isn't. We were used to short queues to get into Disneyland LA and Paris. We were also used to parking very close by, but it was an hour before we even got into the park, as there were two queues and a Monorail queue, just to get into the park. We were fed up before we even started.The other thing was the park itself. It seemed to be in decline and we were used to everything being clean and tidy and in working order overall. This wasn't the case. One of the gents toilet was blocked when we arrived and hours later the same toilet was still blocked. I was pushed out of the way as a woman rushed to the toilet in front of me. The second time I used the toilets most of them had no locks on the doors. They were just generally really shabby,I can say for sure we won't be back anytime soon, if ever."
"While the crowds were heavy, Disney manages to channel people in and out with little outward visibility. The attractions are still interesting, food overall was good, and the service professional and attentive."
"Disney was such a blast for me but I was very disappointed at the treatment I received at First Aid. Not only was I asked to wait for a long time, my paramedic was horrible. They tried to tell me that my allergic reaction was all in my head, when I was having physical symptoms. I felt rushed and that I did not receive the care that I expected at the Disney World. Never again."
"As an annual pass holder, I‚Äôm done with this place! I know I‚Äôm only one of millions of people that visit Disney. And as a pass holder I‚Äôm stuck with this monthly bill till the end of my yearly contract. But I as well as my family will not be renewing or going again. First, I pay about $2000 a year just to be a pass holder. Then when I go, I have hotel/hotel parking fees. Which depending on the place could be a large amount.Second, being a pass holder gives you absolutely NOTHING! You can‚Äôt use it for food, beverages, or anything you truly need to survive there. But hey you get 10% off of stuff that you‚Äôll never need or want unless MAYBE it‚Äôs your first time there. Third, fast pass is a joke! You pay even more money to skip the line‚Ä¶.IF you wake up at 5am and start clicking like a mad man for two hours to get on the one ride that will most likely be closed for some reason, which you‚Äôll then have to cancel that and then have to do your best to go on something you could care less about or keep circling back to the app or the ride to see if it‚Äôs open only to go back to trying to use the fast pass and you might be able to get on the ride before the place closes. Lastly, don‚Äôt ask one person who works there for help!  It‚Äôs like they are trained to not help you in the most helpful way possible. They point you in 20 directions. I got the run around at Hollywood Studios. One person said go ‚Äúthis way‚Äù then about half way to my destination I asked someone if I was going the right way to a customer service tent (because surprise the fast pass had to be pushed) and that person said to go back ‚Äúthis way‚Äù which is where I just came from. Long story short. Fast pass = waste of money. Being a Florida resident/annual pass holder is a year long suck and doesn‚Äôt give you anything but a monthly charge. Oh and if you stay at either an overly priced ‚Äúon property‚Äù hotel or one locally, make sure you plan to spend more money than you did to even walk on the premises. I‚Äôd give a zero if I could."
"Thankfully my young ones had never been before and my older kids barely remember the old days‚Ä¶ 2014-2015.Where every cast member would smile. Where your child would hear ‚ÄúHi Princess/Prince!‚Äù just from staff walking by.Where they looked like they wanted to be there.This trip, that was hard to find.My ASD 7 year old accidentally bumped into a female maintenance worker and she turned on him and stared almost like she was going to fight him. We of course apologized and she kept staring at him. To the point I thought she was joking or was going to do something funny. She wasn‚Äôt. It really soured my  time there, luckily my child‚Äôs neurodivergence helps him brush things off easily.Pair that with the ridiculous Genie + and virtual queues that suck the fun out of things (believe what you hear about this: Paid 175 extra to only get in one lightning lane at a somewhat convenient time).Luckily some magic still remains in the air and we had a nice time. But for the money it costs now , it would be way more worth it if it went back to the old ways."
We went to go on the guardians of the galaxy ride. We waited in multiple virtual queues refreshing constantly and still weren‚Äôt able. They said we couldn‚Äôt ride even after we were unable to queue. This was the reason we bought tickets to Disney not universal for my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday. Virtual queue ruined the park experience and is a bad practice that only puts out people who are late. I was told virtual queues fill in 10 or less seconds making it impossible for almost anyone to get it. We weee waiting and refreshing the page for 10 minutes and still got nothing. It‚Äôs a broken system. If you‚Äôre gonna charge hundreds for a ticket and absurd amounts for food we should at least be able to ride one of the 4 rides in Epcot. Absolutely unacceptable.
"Stay away . Rip of nr 1 in the world . Waist of money . You wil spend 1000,‚Ç¨ per day for a family .Food really trash Extreme expensive. Hot dog 15‚Ç¨ beer 12‚Ç¨ .  Que for hours in line . Stay away"
"We are a Disney family but were disappointed at the complex new ride reservation system. Very much a money grab. However, once you've paid so much to be there from out of state, you do it-- and it was certainly worth it during the Christmas rush! If we hadn‚Äôt paid extra for Individual Lightning Lanes, we would have waited HOURS for Tron, Rise of the Resistance, Guardians of the Galaxy and Avatar Flights of Passage. All of those rides were new and AMAZING. Loved the new trackless rides like Rise of the Resistance and Ratatouille. Genie Plus was worth it everywhere except Hollywood Studios, where the top rides (Slinky) sold out before 10am. We stayed at Pop Century for early entry and the Skyliner, and those worked out great. Things we rope dropped: Hollywood Studios-- Tower of Terror (great as always!), Epcot-- Ratatouille, long wait, worth it!  Animal Kingdom- Expedition Everest (favorite roller coaster)."
"During our visit, we stayed at the Yacht Club. We loved the room, location is close to the transportation center, walking distance to Epcot, boat ride to Hollywood Studio, Swan and Dolphin, and several other places close by. We had the 5 day hopper pass, which was much better years ago. You must plan ahead where you go each day and even half days. We enjoy dining in the finer restaurants, and if we want to go to Be Our Guest with reservations, you have to use a half day hopper pass. This makes your dining cost more. We were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary since we came to Disney World for our honeymoon, and Disney was celebrating 50 years also. I wrote to all of the executive officers about coming for our anniversary. The letter was not acknowledged by any but instead forwarded to an HR woman. We didn't get a congratulations discount on a meal, gift basket, or anything. This was at least our 12th time staying in Disney World at a resort and going to the water parks, Hoop De Doo Show, other fine restaurants, and all the parks, with our family of 6-8  which was all mentioned in the letter. Evidently, the HR department and Disney don't care how many times or how much money you spend as long as you spend on them. Sadly, Disney World is not the same family place. It has gone downhill, and Walt would be disappointed."
This was sensational. The food was good and because it was hot I opted for the ice cream too. Make sure to catch the afternoon parade as it‚Äôs amazing. We stayed until the nighttime to catch the fireworks around 9pm and it was magical they really put on a great show! Defo a bucket list!!
"It was an amazing experience I went in March 2023 and the staff was incredibly nice, I really enjoyed the food. POPCORN IS BUSSIN. 10/10 recommendations to go here. Lines were way to long."
What happened to Disney World? üò´ We last came 7 years ago and so much is different. It felt so magical and everyone was so lovely the first time. It was a push and shove nightmare this time. The crowds were HEAVY for the end of February in my opinion. Maybe I picked the wrong time of year this time... üòí I'm not sure what all was off but it just felt off. I am aggravated that you had to pay for fast passes/lightning lane but I'm glad I didn't because with several rides the lightning lane was wayyyyyyyyy longer than the regular lane. The lines were a nightmare. I don't know if I want to go back.
Arrived to park. getting into park from parking lot was joke took 45 minutes to get through security and into park. Not even a busy day. got into park the virtual due filled up at 7:01 am. they want you to pat 25.00 per person on genie and then you still cast use virtual due or lighting lane because the resort guest filled it up the night before the plebs were able to use it. The food was so expensive. rides were super long. remember this was not the busy times for the park. They nickel and dime you for everything. My kids did not get to go on Tron only virtual due which was filled by Disney resort guest and lighting lane was full by 1:01 pm it opened at 1 pm. Don't go to any Disney park its a waste of money and your time and your sanity
"We had a great time on the parks!  Definitely will do again!  Tickets were on the Magic Band, no problem. Will buy from TripAdvisor again."
Awesome service! Employees are wonderful  people with great smiles and attitude.  I will definitely would want to come back here and will recommend to my friends and familes from Canada.
"We have been going to Disney for over 40 years and our last visit was extremely disappointing. My comments get unhinged towards the end of this review due to the ridiculousness of my privileged people problem and complaints. Due to unforeseen circumstances, our visit was cut short and we purchased one day park hopper tickets to try and get as much done as we could in a day. These tickets came to $250 per person for one day. We also added on genie for an extra $30 per person and purchased two individual lightning lanes at $30 per person per ride. We were up before 7am on the day of our park tickets to make our genie and lighting lane selections and we only ended up getting one ride that we wanted. We were on MULTIPLE APPLE DEVICES trying to get our genie and lightning selections. Mid scream while booking genie, My husband said it was sexy how much of a knowledgeable Disney nerd I am. Maybe I can sell genie booking pics for extra cash. We started at EPCOT early entry and went to Test Track, it broke 4 times when we were waiting in line. We got a lightning lane for guardians and waited 45 min in this line. We tried to get genie and lightning for Remy multiple times throughout the day and we were unsuccessful. We spent most of the day with our heads down on our devices trying to get genie times for rides. We left EPCOT after lunch as it's when the weak drunk bros start puking in the bushes on their around the world beverage quests. If you have little kids it's best to avoid some of thr countries at night, e.g. Mexico, UK, Italy, etc, prepare to see drunken  mayhem uncontrolled by Disney ""security."" It's basically GTFO level at EPCOT at night, especially during festivals. During festivals, you have a very high chance of getting your foot run over by a drunken adult on an electric scooter. I digress, onto our next park. After spending an hour on our dirty disney resort bus making stops around our gargantuan resort we were finally on our way to our Magic Kingdom nightcap. We were feeling confident on our arrival- we had a genie for space mountain and a lightning lane for tron. We made a beeline to tomorrowland and spent two hours trying to get on these two rides, even though we paid extra to essentially cut the lines.  We decided to have one last go of misery and use our genie for thunder mountain. This said genie line was like one genie line, who had mining babies with a penchant for mayhem and tnt and made more lines that looped you and spun you  into a Disney vortex of WTF time is it, where am I? I'll keep waiting for the most ""wildest ride in the wilderness. (said in a screech holla southern gone western accent).I am exhausted and broke from this adventure (I‚Äôm looking at you genie). For my sanity, I need to vacation elsewhere."
"Ok so it's very expensive to get in but once you spend a day here you can see why, we hired a stroller for our 4 year old and it was a godsend and so easy to just park up whilst we went on rides and enjoyed activities, the place was busy but didn't seem too bad, the longest we queued throughout the day was about 45 minutes so we didn't bother with the fast pass apart from the 7 dwarfs ride which was 90 minutes and that was at half 8 at night but well worth it, we caught the parade which was amazing, the fireworks show was incredible, so much to see and do, we didn't get around the whole park so I'm guessing we'll just have to return, we had such an amazing time, I thought it was magical, made even more so by the reaction of our boy, the only downside which I think Disney needs to address are queue jumpers, people will blatantly just walk past saying they need to get to a family member or you'll see them just climbing over barriers, absolutely disgusting and rude behaviour by some people"
"Walt Disney World remains a magical place, but it is an undertaking that requires a significant amount of planning, and it is incredibly expensive. It can get crowded with painful wait times for rides, it is suffocatingly hot throughout the summer, you will drop thousands of dollars on the trip and your kids may end up enjoying playing in the pool at the hotel better than trying to tackle the parks. With that said, there are ways to maximize your experience at WDW and after a dozen weeklong vacations here over the past 20 years, many with children and several with just my spouse or exploring solo, I would like to share some tips. 1.Choose the right time of year to visit when the parks are not overwhelmed with visitors. Avoid all holidays and school breaks especially the week after Christmas and coming during spring break. Additionally, summer is too hot. January through early February, late April-May, and mid-September-early December are best. There are excellent websites and apps with crowd calendars predicting crowd levels at all the park throughout the year. Some parks are less crowded on specific days. The website Touringplans is what I have relied on. 2. Stay on Disney property. Yes, it is more expensive than off property, but it gives you access to the Disney transportation system, allows early entrance to the parks and you can purchase individual Lightening Lane tickets beginning at 7am rather than when the park opens. The Deluxe resorts are amazing but are priced at a ridiculous level. The Value Resorts are the least expensive but are the most crowded, bus wait times can be long, and they lack the ""magic"". The Moderate Resorts give you the most bang for the buck. Theming at the Moderate Resorts is terrific. 3. Get up early, arrive 30-40 min before rope drop and head to your must-ride attractions right at opening. I realize this is no way to spend a real vacation, but this is Disney, and it needs to be approached differently. This will automatically save you 2 hours of standing in line that day as you can probably head to a second popular ride after riding the first and have a manageable wait as others are still arriving at the entrance gate. 4. Understand the System. Become familiar on how Genie + and Lightening Lanes work and make full use of these systems to stay one step ahead. Accept that you will fork out big bucks to fully implement but don't try doing a busy day at Disney without these tools. Incorporate Park Hopping into your plan. Start at one park and as it gets busy hop to another park that has a lower predicted crowd levels that day.5. Make table service and character dining reservations well in advance. Some of the most popular need to be made 6 months in advance and you better be ready to book right at 7am. 6. Come with a Plan. The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World is the bible for anyone planning a trip to Disney. Read it cover to cover. Many other excellent websites packed with information can be found. Hit the busy rides first thing in the morning or use Genie +/LL. Less busy rides are for the afternoon when the park is most crowded or...7. Take an Afternoon Break. This is especially important if you have children. If you are arriving at rope drop, either you or your kids are going to lose it if you try to stay the whole day. In the late morning as lunch approaches, leave the park and ride back to your resort (another reason to stay on Disney property). Eat lunch, have a swim or take a nap. Come back refreshed in the late afternoon and evening to enjoy the rest of the night. You can use the park hopper option to head elsewhere that evening.8. If you have young children, meeting the characters and getting photos and autographs will be the highlight of the trip and will create unforgettable memories. For preschool kids, this isn't someone in a costume. They are meeting the real Mickey Mouse or Cinderella. Make sure you save plenty of time for these encounters. Epcot World Showcase is a surprisingly great spot to meet characters as there are less kids here and plenty of opportunities. Make sure you do at least one character meal. Pooh and friends in the Crystal Palace or the princesses in Norway at Epcot are both great spots.If all of this seems overwhelming, you should think twice about coming here. This is what today's Disney World demands. There is no room for spontaneity. Only clean, well-organized and efficient fun and a willingness to drop a lot of cash. However, if you can handle that, WDW can still be ""The Most Magical Place on Earth."""
"Save your money.  We took our kids 30 years ago and had a blast.  We took the grandkids this past weekend and rides we wanted to go on were either ""temporarily unavailable"" or you had to wait 2 hours in line (no seats) for a 2 minute ride.  Definitely not worth the money.  Food was way overpriced.  It rained the days we were at the park and a dollar store parka cost $10.  They should have been giving them away with the billions of dollars they made last year.  Corporate greed.  Shame on you disney - it's all about the money and not the guest experience.  I will give them credit for the pleasant employees we met.  They were well trained for customer service.  I also give them credit for allowing customers to bring their own snacks and water into the parks.  But beyond that it was a total waste of money.  We went to ride the rides and the ones we wanted were either unavailable or spend 2 hours waiting in line.  Will never recommend to anyone or go there again.  It was pure torture!!!"
"The rides are good for children / adults if you can bear the queues.  We have been many times before but this time we felt like 2nd class citizens.  Previously you were allowed to book a fast pass about twice a day.  Now you have to buy them, whilst I understand this makes good business sense (Universal have been doing it for years), it makes the ordinary queues much longer.You would be standing in the general queue and the person counting people on would ALWAYS let ALL the fast pass people go before any of the general queue.  Do they forget we bought tickets too?You might agree to queue for 30 minutes and end up queuing for nearly an hour, this is unacceptable.  We will not visit any Disney park in the future."
"Rides constantly breaking down, nothing like waiting for 90 minutes then told they were closing the ride. Then looking at the map and seeing other rides temporarily closed. Very frustrating both days at the parks."
Need to update the Map/Guide books with the updated information. Also the numbers they use on the map should be on the actual building to be identified. Should have a better plan for Disney Princess meet up. Each park should have all the princesses in 1 building so kids can enter from one end and meet all by the time they get out‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very difficult to stand to meet 1 or 2 Princess and wait each time 1 hr plus. Should open at least 1 Halal Zabiha restaurant each park; as good amount of Muslim tourist will be accommodated and happy.
"My family booked a WDW vacation with a travel agent. We had to leave 1 day early due to a family death.My agent talked to WDW to request a refund. They said I needed to request and I did. They said they couldn‚Äôt help me. I was given a number to call for a refund. When I called, I was told my agent needed to call. I told them she had and they wouldn‚Äôt help her. She said to have her call again. The agent called again. They wouldn‚Äôt help her saying that I needed to handle it, but they won‚Äôt help either of us. Just tell me I‚Äôm not getting a refund. STOP placating me with the promise of one and then never giving me an answer. FRUSTRATING to say the least. I had more respect for Disney than I do now for giving me the run-around especially at this trying time for our family."
"Absolutely a waste of money! All digital reservations,  genie,  lighting lane BS, all to confuse you and catch you up so they can steal your money. Avoid Disney parks! Total lack of customer service...the place has really gone down hill! Not the Disney you remember!"
"Overcrowded, if you can‚Äôt afford to pay for all the extras it‚Äôs basically standing in line for 2 rides. I‚Äôm 44 now, my parents dreamed of taking me as a kid, and for that reason I travelled to the states with my daughter to tell my mum what it was like, spent crazy amounts of money and feel it wasn‚Äôt worth the effort, totally disappointed. I doubt my daughter would want to take the next generation. Apart from the queues unless you have a Disney PHD, you will be out thought by all the loopholes, nothing magic about this. Avoid, save your money and go somewhere nice on holiday."
"Disney has been fantastic through the years for our family, but I don't think I can stomach watching the Genie lines continue to go quicker after we already paid $1,000 per day for our family to get in and now we need to shell out more money to go on more than a few rides per day. What happened to the manual fast passes free to everyone that has already paid? Instead, Disney has rolled out a complicated ""Genie/Caste"" system that separates the middle class from the Rich. If your middle class, you can stand in a line for a couple of more hours because the $1,000 per day you spent for your family to get in isn't enough."
I learned this trip to a Disney resort that Disney employees search every room at their resorts every day. Often you have no idea they did it because you are out. I voiced my displeasure with this after a knock at the door informing me they need to search my room. Their claim is that its for safty and security. Looking for potentially dangerous things. Sure enough they have in fine print that they reserve the right to do this. This is very misleading because they should be up front and say we are doing this every day whether you like it or not.  So think about this. Your child runs back to the room to find a stranger searching your room. There are so many problems with this scenario. Let that sink in!  Current Disney management have removed the magic. I'm done with Disney!
"As magical as ever! I grew up being able to go to Disney World, and am grateful for the option being my children. It‚Äôs open later hours in order to maximize our time and inclusive for all. The kids loved it and so did we, as adults!"
"Disney has become a money grab. I have not been since my kids were young and I have no desire to go back ever. The lightning passes target people with money and you have to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve your place or you will not get on any rides. The parks are over crowded and everything is over the top expensive. If you want water you have to overpay for water bottles, and there are no filling stations to refill the bottles so you are wasting plastic. I‚Äôm not sure how Disney is required to have the filling stations. It‚Äôs crazy. Lines were so long for everything. I know we went at a busy time but I will never make that mistake again. I am lucky enough to be able to afford this ‚Äúvacation‚Äù. I can‚Äôt imagine how hard it is for people who scrimp and save to be able to go. I couldn‚Äôt wait to leave."
"Since we have to rely on our phones for our Disney Experience App why are there no free charging stations or outlets throughout the park. I didn't think that the Magic Kingdom was magical. Almost every ride was having mechanical issues and the lines were 2 hours long, unless you had a lightening pass, but buying them will put you in the poor house. I was able to get into a queue once and was given a time at 8:30 when we were leaving the park. We couldn't  stay because we wouldnt have been able to catch  the bus to our hotel. I may consider returning to Animal Kingdom my favorite park.  There were issues with line jumpers. There were a lot of scooters and people who were using them as race cars.  I did like that you could bring in a backpack for drinks and snacks."
my family made my late grandma's dream of all the grandkids going to Disney together. we all had a great time highly recomend .
"Be aware that the cast members running some of the rides favor lightening lane people far and above everyday ticket people.  Bryan at the safari ride in animal kingdom was letting 4 regular line people in for every 30 lightening lane people. The wait time for standard was 45 minutes and we were in line for 125 minutes.  When we said something to him he barked that now he would make our whole line wait even longer to punish us for speaking up.  I can‚Äôt stand that long and was limping for three days after that ride.  There was no place to sit the whole time.  People around us were calling lightening lanes a scam just to get more money after you already pay to get on the rides.  I now agree that Disney is a scam and will stick to going to Busch Gardens and Universal. Only the rich can now afford Disney, Walt would be ashamed of his business."
"Always dreamed of Disney as a child but my parents never had the money. I finally took my family including three children. Walt Disney is rolling in his grave if he would spend a day in any of the parks. Once he got through the crowds including obese people on scooters racing to the front of lines only to disembark with tall slushies onto the rides, and fake disabled family entourages where entire families go to the front of the line because of one actor, he would have to deal with transgender characters, diverse incorrect character portrayals, and endless lineups. If the Disney  management and board dont recognize their ways soon, the park will suffer. My friends refuse to go at all."
"This place has gone down severely the last ten years, the place is so busy, lineups for the rides were over 2 hours, the trains packed. The food ridiculously expensive and really mediocre at best, if one can even get into a restaurant, but the concession stands and food in the parks outright terrible. The overall prices very expensive.  Spend your children's college funds somewhere else, Disney is bygone glory and a terrible alternative for a relaxing enjoyable adventure."
"Listen!! Keep your expectation low and don't try to do to much. We have been to Disney World several times in the last few years and this is what I have learned. Pick 3 or 4 must do things per day. If the rides that you want to do are popular, rope drop in the morning to get those out of the way first. Genie Plus is worth the money if you hate lines. Watch a few YouTube videos on how to use this option. Don't stress and let the magic happen!!"
"It's too crowded, and the Genie Plus system is a pain in the butt. It's stressful always checking your phone to make sure you time rides, sit-down meals, and special pay for experience just right. I think it's just too big. I like Disneyland much better. A lot of the rides and attractions are old and outdated."
This place is over rated!!! Save your money!!! Have a better experience at some of the other Amusement parks in Orlando... We went to Animal Kingdom today and the lines were too long!!  3 hour wait for the Avatar Flight ride... Disney DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR TIME OR EXPERIENCE...THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY!! it is way overpriced and over rated... Do not go to Disney parks!
"Magic is gone. Day one, animal kingdom, long lane, day two, magic kingdom, boring plus long waiting, more like shopping center. Day three, Epcot, long waiting, we were waiting for frozen ever after ride for two hours, suddenly they told us technical issues. Simply, they told us to come back later and wait in lane again. They could just give us a sticker or lightning pass for that single ride. Basically, they don‚Äôt care you customers, Disney has millions of you each day.   Day 4, which is today, Hollywood studio, we decided not to go, we choose to abandon ticket, and simply go to universal studio. Because of my work, my family move to different states every 3-5 years. We went amusement parks a lot. Seaworld, LEGOLAND, six flags. I have no issues with any other parks before. First time, Disney and last time Disney. Overall experience is not good at all."
"Sorry to say but Disney World has lost the magic. I have been visiting the parks with my family for over 40 years and it has been really going down hill recently. I remember when cast members were friendly and would greet you in the morning and wish you a good night at the end of the day. Now your lucky if you get a ‚Äúhi‚Äù. Most of the time they are rude or yelling at park goers for various reasons. The park is dirty, paint flaking off railings and walls, mold growing on rides and ride buildings. You simply wouldn‚Äôt see this 20 years ago. Just a poor job of maintaining. Feels more like a money trap than a magical experience, pay for your tickets then pay more to skip a couple lines(used to be free) and if you want to skip the premium rides, pay an additional fee on top of the ticket price and other genie plus fee. Upper management are probably currently dreaming up even more ways to get even more money out of people. If the experience met the price I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this review. I thinking my Disney ride has come to an end. Time to check out other destinations or head over to Universal."
I have reviewed previously. I am just coming on to say the new Genie+ system is straight up terrible and mean spirited. It‚Äôs like a hidden fee on busy days because you really need it to do anything and then it makes the wait for the bonuses so much longer. Just a terrible divisive thing that takes away from the experience of the parks and separates based on class. It‚Äôs just an overall Sh$&*y thing to have implemented
"Disney has LOST its magic. Queuing 1-3 hours isn‚Äôt fun for a 5 mins ride. The price to enter, food and drinks is a ripe off. In America, you‚Äôd expect English to be spoken but the entire place is a foreign environment with Spanish being the primary language. Great disappointment, never again."
"Disney overbooks way, way too much. The smallest rides have a 30 minute to 3 hour wait time. Fast passes? They‚Äôre gone, replaced by a program a 10 year old child would develop better. You‚Äôre basically required to buy Genie+ passes past midnight, in order to reserve ‚Äúlightning lane‚Äù passes during a window that starts at 7:00am and ends at 7:00am and 30 seconds. More often than not, they‚Äôre all booked and you don‚Äôt get your money back. So basically a money generating scam to benefit Disney‚Äôs shareholders and pissing off its customers. And the instructions are abysmal. The food is quite pricey. USD $10.30 per slice of pizza. $5.00 for a fountain drink. I understand there‚Äôs inflation, but this has more to do with customers incurring the cost of lost profit during COVID. I have an idea for them, perhaps fewer than a dozen employees greeting you at every ride lineup. The fun isn‚Äôt there anymore"
"After nearly 20 years my Disney World memories faded. Somehow I fell for the Disney illusion and bought into Disney World attractions hype. In the process of booking on the Disney web site I selected a 2-day package with park hopper. Based on the $2,320.68 package price I assumed it was two days and two nights. Instead the package was a one night. This was my mistake that I did not discover until the day we arrived. We arrived late the first evening. Our first day in the parks which you must reserve in advance was the next day. We had no room for the second night. We stay on property for the benefits such as early attraction reservations. We planned our days. We made our park reservation at Hollywood Studios and planned to go to Epcot after 2:00 where we had dinner reservations. It was challenging finding availability at a decent restaurant. The first morning we bought Genie+.  At 7:00 am I attempted to reserve a spot on Rise of the Resistance but the fist reservation was 7:05 pm during our dinner reservation at another park. I attempted to shuffle our day but once you make a park reservation your stuck. And rebooking dinner reservations is difficult. By the time I got back around to reserving a spot on Rise of Resistance it was booked out. The next best options was Smuggler's Run at 2:30. The first decent attractions were not available until later in the day. Genie+ was practically useless. We went to the park but the lines were incredibly long. When we arrived Rise of the Resistance was 205 minutes or 3 hours and 25 minutes.  Other decent attractions were 140 - 155 minutes.  Who wants to spend 6-10 hours in line all day. For $2,394.68 we got an overnight stay, pushing through crowds and then waiting in line for most of the day to experience attractions for maybe 10-15 minutes. If you cannot get into the attractions in a reasonable amount of time what is the point. You wait 15 minutes for even a simple overpriced coffee. There is a long line for everything. Making it worse The Disney mobile app drained my mobile battery. So, I did not even have my mobile to pass the time. We had time for 3 attractions. The experience was so bad we did not stay and use our second day park pass. It was throwing good money after bad.  I just wanted to leave and get away from the crowds. I had enough. Nothing was worth waiting in line for hours. I cannot get the wasted time and money back but at least I can warn others. Frankly, Disney World is not a magical place unless you like lines, waiting, boredom and crowds. It is the most miserable place on earth.  I do not get the Disney World attraction unless you like lines, waiting, crowds and overpriced food. It is amazing that millions of people are paying for this experience."
"Whew don't do it. It's not like when we were kids. The prices and lines are insane and I'm finally over it. $250 per person and we had 8. We had hopper passes and rode 4 rides, only 1 we planned. I've been going every year it gets worse and worse. No magic just staying up insanely late to try to plan your day and getting up absurdly early to TRY and make ride reservations which we couldn't even do because system was glitching. Kids were extremely disappointed there's no limit to the lines it's just completely consumed by greed now. Don't say I didn't warn you if you just have to go but universal and even sea world provide a much better value now especially for kids over 5."
"I have been to Disney several times before and read the reviews prior to going recently.  The reviews reflected terrible experiences people had at Disney but I just could not believe that this could be true.  Unfortunately my family's experience was so disappointing.  This is not a place for families and especially children.  How does Disney think that waiting in line for 60-120 minutes is OK?  People were not happy at any of the parks we attended, visitors or workers.  We used Genie plus and Lightning lane and payed extra for rides or we would have only been able to ride 2 or 3 rides per day due to extremely long lines.  We reserved a ride at Magic Kingdom only to find out the ride was not working and a very non-chalant employee told us ""it should be working by end of day, lightning lane is nonrefundable.""  The wait times listed on the gates and on the APP were inconsistent.  The app time would say 20 minute wait but the actual time at the gate was a minimum of 60 minutes.  What is Disney expectation for a child?   This requires all adults to be planning three steps ahead. Plan to mentally exhausted or save your sanity and leave the park. If you want to be able to look up from the app and see your family, it's not an option. Save your money and avoid the memory maker pass. All photo ops require you to wait in line. Some of the photographers are fun and engaging. However, many seemed tired and disinterested. It seems Disney has increased the volume of all themed music in their parks. This is likely due to mask the sound of crying children because they have spent their entire vacation waiting in a line.  I now agree with others, the Magic is gone."
"The most disappointing trip everBeen to Disneyland before so we thought to try disneyworld. We stayed off property and had a 4 day park hopper ticket and got genie + every day. The days at the parks were bad. Wake up at 6.40 and wait to refresh to get in virtual lines and still missed out on tron. Couldn‚Äôt buy lighting lines until park opened. Once park opened they had all sold out. Genie + was giving me time slots for 11pm and this was a 8 in the morning. Lines were all 2 hours plus. The parks were dirty - rubbish on floors, graffiti on gems in snow whites ride, toliets outdated. Food was a let down - love a good churro but 7.20 for a cold flavourless one isn‚Äôt cool. We ended up leaving the parks after 2pm most days since we couldn‚Äôt be bothered lining up for 2 hours and were over being shoulder to shoulder with every man and his dog."
"I have been going to Disney parks for 30 plus years with my children and grandchildren ,this is our first time back since disney shut down for covid and lost season passes ,let me say we all used love to come to disney but the magic is all gone pay 150.00 a day plus a person to get in then have pay 69.00 more a day to get a pass to get on rides faster then some rides pay another fee to get on then in a 12 hour day get to ride 3 rides ,all it is get you in gate and spend ,spend and spend and in reality all you do is stand in line 2 hours and eat junk food ,it is not fun anymore all fun has been removed for profit ,I understand need make money and maintain parks but the people working make peanuts and ceo,s make millions ,my opinion Universal is a much better park at this time and can buy a season pass for amount of 2 days at Disney"
"Don‚Äôt buy your magic kingdom or other park tickets as part of a package. Disney markets it as a convenience (for them), but it actually creates more stress for you. After tackling the tram, the boat, a long security line and then another long line to show our tickets, we were instructed to go wait in the guest relations line to ‚Äúactivate the tickets.‚Äù And then repeat the ticket line. We had never had to endure this extra step before and were totally baffled. After inquiring, we were told that this was because we bought the tickets as part of a package (on the Disney website). Super helpful ‚Ä¶ We will clearly never do this again. This was a terrible, unwelcoming start to our trip and made us miss our first fast pass. Thank you, Disney, for putting your convenience before ours. It was great to get my three kids out of bed at 5:30 to try to beat the lines when you had unknowingly already set us up for defeat. Please spare me any more corporate speak."
I work in market research. Genie plus and lighting pass has made total chaos of the park experience. Standby times are inaccurate. Your Koda may .ot see one ride they want without waiting at least 90 min. This made our trip $300 per ride !  No limit to lighting passes. It's crazy. Today 3 rides shut down and many featueres 20 year tradition over. No more Disney for us.
"Avoid Genie Plus, it‚Äôs a pure scam. You need to wake up at the crack of dawn and be an IT expert to make it work. Even then you still don‚Äôt get access to all the rides.The old Fast Pass system had a purpose, with scheduling options and best of all it was free. But I get Disney is all about making money, so why didn‚Äôt they just keep the tried and proven fast pass system and just charge for it?????The Genie Plus is a basic diss on those making planned resort reservations!Now as an Annual passholder, the only real benefit is multiple visits in one year, other wise just stick to regular tickets."
"Not the exclusive event you might think for ¬£165 per person!! We adore Disney and have been visiting for years. I was super excited about this event but ended up disappointed. The Christmas parade and Minnie‚Äôs firework show was spectacular but it was just far too busy. I had read they only let 20k in but it was a LOT busier than that. Needless to say we only managed one ride because if we had queued the 80 average minutes per ride we would have missed the parade and fireworks.  We even managed to get a virtual queue for Tron but when we turned up for it the ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô queue was out the door and would have meant us missing the parade! Disney - you get so much right but come on, please don‚Äôt put the $ before the magic üò¢."
"One of the best days of my life. It was well worth the money. Every child‚Äôs dream of going here and to see my children so happy and delighted to experience disneyworld was the absolute best. The food was delicious, the place spotless and staff friendly and helpful. And to experience this at Christmas with all the stunning trees and decorations was a real bonus. If you stay after the sun goes down rug up warm."
"It was 4th time our family visited Orlando. The theme parks have lost their magic. üòû We were here in Dec 2015 last, but so much has changed for worse. The parks close at 8 pm instead of mid-night. Some of most amazing activities/rides/shows are closed permanently or if open, they close before end of day while their boutiques are still open. No one in our family remembers seeing so many shops and restaurants before and with so much unhealthy foods. Being so disappointed of all 3 parks visited so far, we decided  not to go to any other theme parks. We usually buy our tickets before coming to Orlando. So happy we didn‚Äôt have time and decided to do it while in Orlando. If you have not been to Disney World in Orlando before Covid, you may still enjoy it. Also if you are looking for roller coasters, there are tons now in any park you choose. For sure we never come back and will advise friends to go Disney in other countries."
"I would not at all recommend paying for the Genie Plus. I had 9 people in our party, so I paid $260 extra to be able to schedule our rides. I was only able to use it for two rides. The Slinky Dog ride was down, too, while we were there."
Had a wonderful trip. Parks were a little busy but got to do everything ew wanted to do. Stayed at Pop Century (our favorite resort).Stayed away from spending crazy money making dinner and lunch reservations and just did quik service. Food was stellar almost everywhere we tried.
"UK PLEASE READ‚Ä¶.  PEOPLE PLEASE DO NOT GO TO DISNEY THIS IS NO JOKE‚Ä¶‚Ä¶This place is a greedy money making pit, you will spend thousands to queue for 1-3 hours each ride OR PAY FOR DISNEY + ON TOP OF WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR YOUR PARK TICKET (which was over ¬£1000) Disney+ will get you 2-3 rides for $27 EACH  PERSON per day FOR CRAPPY RIDES YOU THEN HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR‚Ä¶. RIDES LIKE AVATAR, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, TRON and (MORE ON TOP OF PARK TICKETS AND DISNEY +) Then only LIMITED PASSES as too many people book lightening lane you can‚Äôt get on it !!  Disney plus and lightening lane you have to book limited slots then get back at that time to ride!!YOU HAVE TO BOOK EPCOT FOR ‚ÄúGUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY‚Äù to get on lightening lane the day before THEN go on app just before 7am refreshing it EVERY SECOND on virtual queue that opens at 7am exactly for A CHANCE OF GETTING ON THIS RIDE then it says join queue THEN  ‚ÄúNO AVAILABILITY‚Äù (see photo and time) every day the same thing trying to get on this ride!!! you are then stuck in this park until 2pm until you can switch park!!! I HAVE BEEN HERE 2 WEEKS AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ON TRON OR GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY AT ALL!!!!I HAVE ONLY MANAGED TO GET OM 2-3 RIDES A DAY THEN I QUEUED TWICE FOR A RIDE FOR ONE HOUR THEN THE SAME RIDE FOR 2 AND HALF HOURS FOR IT TO BREAK DOWN BOTH TIMES!!!EVERYTHING HAS TO BE BOOKED ON A VERY COMPLICATED APP !!! So you will spend a lot of your time working it out or trying to find someone to help you do this. THIS IS STRESSFUL by day 10 of my 2 week stay I want to go home :(In these parks you will end up paying a fortune for food and drink a coke alone is nearly ¬£5 !!  Standard Burger, fries and a coke for 2 people ¬£65, ice cream ¬£6-7, there is no local shops to walk to so if in Disney hotel or Partner Hotel and don‚Äôt have a car you will have to pay prices or spend your time getting a LYFT or UBER to find cheaper food.NOT A MAGICAL EXPERIENCE AS PROMISED - STRESSFUL, EXPENSIVE, NOT WHAT YOU PAID FOR JOKE OF A PLACE !!!!"
First trip with family to visit Disneyworl and it's the best ever. Kids loved this park with a lot of shows and rides to do. Affordable foods to buy. Souvenirs a little pricy tho but it's worthed to get at least a souvenir. Opening show at the castle and fireworks are the best and please don't missed it lol. We stayed inside the park from 8 am for early access and stayed till 10 pm and mo regrets . Very Highly Recommended to visit.
"We have been coming annually over the past 2 decades because we like it. The parks are very clean and well staffed with friendly and helpful employees. The same goes for the resorts and villas which are themed and adds to the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù vacation experience. The rides are fun and imaginative, the musicals very good too, like Frozen/ Lion King. I‚Äôve used free bus, rail, and boat transportation to get around Disney area from the resort, it works well, takes longer than driving but you save money. I come to town prepared with a plan of our time for the parks to avoid frustration, I recommend to do your homework. The resorts are themed and provide daily activities too. Sometimes we split a ‚Äúpark day‚Äù in two with a rest back at the room or pool if staying really close to one of the parks."
What was once a destination now a place to avoid at all costs Disney has gone to the Dark Side To the Extreme in the past we would not miss a visit to Walt Disney World every year with Out exception but now we avoid this Woke World pathetic and very sad to see this once was  a Dream World
What happened to Disney at Christmas?  I‚Äôve been there years ago and it was brilliantly decorated with Christmas trees everywhere and the Cinderellas Castle was animated and changed its look every few minutes throughout the evening !  Don‚Äôt get me wrong it was beautiful but much of the Xmas vibe was focused mainly on Main St.  paid extra for the Mickeys Christmas Party and Minis dessert party.  No characters were walking around anywhere.  Seemed to me just another ploy to pack more people in and spend more money on less. According to a cast member the Christmas trees were removed to pack more people in.  Disneys not for experience anymore just a money scam.
Was very disappointed with the whole evening. Paid extra money for the Mini mouse dessert party.  Was very expensive.  Been to previous special events and it was basically cafeteria style eating.     No interaction w staff. You would think Mini would be there and pics etc w characters-none.  The area wasn‚Äôt festive and didn‚Äôt have a party like atmosphere.  Not worth for over $100 each.
Pro tip for family‚Äôs with small children: carry water and snacks. It can be priceyVery nice staff and very nice way to spend the day. Worth every penny
"The ‚Äúbase‚Äù ticket is a bait and switch scam. We paid to enter the park, then paid almost as much for ride passes. Customer service and fantasy illusion are gone. Universal is now more immersive and guest oriented. Honestly, I think Six Flags is on par with our Disney World experience but at 5% of the price (with their perpetual promotions). Disney certainly has more experiences than Six Flags but not 20 times more and no longer significantly better."
"Not worth the money spent. Long lines, horrible service, no space. You can spenf your money elsewhere and have much better experience. This place is overrated, overpriced and even kids said that it's not worth it."
"The Walt Disney World Resort is a massive complex consisting of 4 main parks, 2 water parks, and lots of golf courses and resorts. I've been to all of the parks and water parks when I was younger and I've been to Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Hollywood Studios as an adult. These parks are massive and endlessly entertaining and they really do make you feel like you're in another world, which is quite a feat in today's day and age. Yes, they're expensive (exceedingly so actually - staying at the Polynesian Resort is more expensive than staying in actual French Polynesia), but if you can get past that you can really enjoy the whole experience. And there are definitely ways to cut down on expenses. We've never stayed on resort as there are several very nice hotels that are just outside the Disney property that are more affordable. You can also look at a lot of the souvenirs online and pick out things like Disney ears ahead of time so that you're less likely to impulse buy excessively (which will happen anyway). Planning a Disney trip is no easy task and it's honestly sometimes harder than planning a huge road trip, but you can make it less stressful. Since we've been to Disney several times within the past few years, I'll give you some tips:1) Get Genie+. I know it seems like an extra cash grab (and it is), but you don't want to be spending extra time in line for rides if you don't have to. You're already spending a lot for the ticket price and it won't be as enjoyable of a time if you have to spend more time in line than necessary. It's like the airline checked bag fees or concert booking fees that are now ubiquitous: very annoying, but not much way around them. Make sure you budget that into your ticket price and you won't be shocked when you buy it. Also, really think about if you'd use the park-hopper option. The parks are pretty far from each other and you'll spend a good amount of time just traveling from one to the other. This may be a good option if you only like some things in a particular park, but we typically spend all day in one park. 2) Make sure to get the app for your phone. All restaurant reservations and Genie+ reservations are done through the app, which makes it invaluable. You can also see estimated wait times for rides, which makes it easier to strategically plan your day or quickly change the plan if a ride breaks or has an excessive wait time. You can also mobile order food/drinks at several places and that alone can save you a lot of time. Make sure to bring an extra charger for your phone though as the app tends to drain your battery.3) Don't over plan. This is the biggest thing we've seen that leads to the trip going awry. Yes, you often have to book some restaurants months ahead of time (they open 60 days in advance) in order to get a reservation (looking at you Be Our Guest) and yes, you have to get Genie+ ride reservations, but you don't have to over plan more than that. You don't want to forget that this is an amusement park and that the point of coming here is to have fun. We typically pick one sit-down restaurant for the day, then try to get Genie+ reservations for our top 1-2 rides, and then wing the rest of it. Most of the fun is wandering around and seeing what you can stumble upon, whether thats food/drink, shops, or rides. 4) Don't try to do everything. There's no way that you can do everything at Disney and trying to cram everything into a trip will increase your level of stress and won't let you really savor the moments at the park. It's also a ton of walking and you'll probably be exhausted after a day or two, especially if you're not used to walking 20k steps a day. If you're coming for a full week, I would budget in rest days (or rest half-days) to make sure that you don't wear yourself out.These are only a few tips for Disney World and there are numerous blogs out there with more detail than I could ever include here. Things can also change frequently, so I would recommend looking at some of those closer to your trip for the most up to date information. Overall though, don't forget to have fun and be a little kid again. Everyone, no matter how old, has an inner child, and this is a place where that inner child can come out and play again."
"After going in October I see why 90% of the recent reviews are negative. Confusing apps that you have to spend hours learning how to use, so you can get on rides. Extra money grab like genie + and lighting lanes. I was told by friends I had to pay for those extras and they were right. I went on Thursday, not around a holiday and every ride was an hour to an hour and a half wait. By 3 PM the park was packed almost shoulder to shoulder and there wasn't a ride under a 2 1/2 hour wait time. Who stands in a ride line with kids for even and hour and has fun. I paid extra to get on all the rides quickly, but there are only 5 or 6 rides in the whole park and it's almost impossible to ride on all of them even with paying because the lines are so long. How is it supposed to be fun running ride to ride and still not getting on all of them. If you are an adult that loves Disney or have kids that love the characters it could have some magic still."
The first day was amazing. We had so much fun. The second day my granddaughter got sick and we were due to go home the following day. I called to see if I could get a portion of money back and they refused to give anything back. She said I could use the ticket for the next day but we had to leave. We may never go back again.
"Park is overcrowded, understaffed and dirty and cheesy. They have lowered their standards from years ago. Employees pushing guests out of the way to get through with carts. Way overpriced. Not well maintained at all. Save your money"
"For a first-time visitor, I'd say it is a magical place with so many adventures to be had and memories to be made.  I think in general, between all the parks, you can get a taste of the entire world by traveling just here and spending 3-4 days.  That's impossible anywhere else.  Despite visiting on a very busy holiday weekend, there was still plenty of opportunity to get on key rides we wanted and take in all the shows, shops, and food we could handle.  It just takes a bit of prep work in the weeks ahead of time.  One little tip (since entire networks are dedicated to that)... early park entry based on your hotel really does matter.  We got in at least two rides more because of it.  Have a great visit!"
Magic Kingdom was amazing. Very well organized. Staff truly trues their best to make everyone happy. Characters were superb. The greatest company in the world.
"Woke pathetic been coming her since early 70s when they opened and has been taken over to the Dark side at one time it was a destination but no more for us thanks but no thanks left America in the dust, the food in Disney is horrible at best"
"Save your money on the savvy‚Äôs lightsaber build .. $300 and the thing stopped working 6 months later.. changed batteries, did everything the internet said to do , contacted Disney , told to bad so sad 30 day refund or exchange‚Ä¶ my 6 year old daughter is devastated.. we went for her birthday.. we won‚Äôt be going back.."
"Where do I even begin?  Shoulder to shoulder crowds.  Adults cutting off children away from their family because they have to run to a ride/attraction.  My local amusement park here in Pittsburgh has like triple the rides that this place has....seriously, each park has like 5 or 6 rides at best.  The food is the same all around at the quick services.  I dont understand the concept of paying $100+ to gain entry and then spend $100+ on a sit down dinner.  Was my first and LAST trip to Disney.  I honestly believe the folks that say the magic is still there, are the ones that ruin it for everyone else and are delusional.  Ride wait times are ridiculous and the length that a ride lasts is humorous at best.....wait forever just to get you out of the way and off of the ride. We did all 4 parks.  Its more of ""have to spend money, just to spend more money"" type of deal.......the average joe cannot and will not be able to afford this place any longer unfortunately.  I know for us......we had fun because thats our nature, but will NEVER pay to attend any WALT DISNEY WORLD/LAND PARK again."
"Nightmare booking - spend 2 hours trying to book tickets for my family. Super stressfull. Tried all credit cards. My wife signed up and did the same - even signed up for a paypal account. Not luck - no help from chat bot - only it explained the problem. We live at a street in Denmark with a special Danish letter √Ö and as Disney checks the address connected with credit cards we could not pay as the website do not allow the letter √Ö. We had to show up and pay at the gate - but we could not get fast pass, so we waited maybe 3 hours in lines. What the F‚Ä¶. Suggest you go to Universal instead much better park."
"I was at Disneyland January 23/24 with my husband and my 3 kids (13,11,9).When switching parks (leaving Disneyland Park) on the 24th at 8:30pm, we had a horrific experience. I have ALS and cannot speak or use my legs/arms.I have to use a power chair to get around, attached to a speech machine I use with my eyes. If you know someone with a disability, you know nothing is ever easy. You are constantly figuring out how to adjust given the current circumstances in front of you. The handicap exit was blocked off for no apparent reason with a worker standing in front of it. My best guess is that she wanted everyone to go through the gate to count, so the staff member told me to go through the regular exit. I did, and the 2 automatic doors closed in on my legs as I was just trying to go through, digging in to them-I have pictures and videos-leaving a gauge and lots of bruising. My kids jumped towards me and started trying to pull the doors off me. The staff member saw this and started yelling at my kids to stop because they would break the gate. They kept trying because they saw the fear on my face and knew I couldn't do or say anything about it. My husband then said, ‚Äúdo you want a broken gate or broken leg.‚ÄùThis was all horrible, but the shocking part of it all was the staff. The lady continued to fuss at all of us and just very rudely said I should've gone slower and that was the problem, as I tried again it still didn‚Äôt work! My husband had to physically drive me through-his theory was that the sensor wasn‚Äôt catching either my height or the doors only allotted enough time for a typical person, not a handicapped slow moving person like me. Then she just turned her back and ignored my husband and caregiver as they tried to talk to her. She knew we were upset and didn't want to deal with us so she called someone else over. Jian came over and basically said he heard what happened and didn't know what we wanted him to do about it. ‚ÄúDo you need medical attention for your injuries ‚Äú he kept repeating. My caregiver told him that acknowledging how poorly it was handled and how rudely we were treated along with an apology would be nice. Stone cold he said, ""OK, I''m sorry. And I will speak on her (the other staff member) behalf and say sorry for her. It was pathetic. I just turned around and drove off in amazement. I didn‚Äôt feel like Jian really ‚Äògot it‚Äô either, unfortunately and I didn‚Äôt have my speech machine to communicate.There were two problems in my opinion. The first one being a power wheelchair or any wheelchair should never have to be required to go through the automatic doors, this is exactly why the handicap opening RIGHT NEXT TO IT is there for. Secondly, the situation could have gone entirely differently had she just responded differently upon seeing my kids holding the doors from crushing my leg. A simple ‚Äúoh my gosh how did that happen, I am so sorry that happened! Here let me show you so that never happens again ‚Äú would have diffused the tension.I've always been a huge Disney fan and have LOVED Disneyworld trips in the past. In fact, this trip was gifted to my family by Team Gleason Adventures, an ALS organization that aids families in making dream trips/memories a possibility. Of all the places, I chose Disney for my trip. To say I was disappointed in Disneyland's staff is an understatement. In fact, there were many occasions on this trip that the Disneyland staff was cold and not helpful at all. The exact opposite of what one would expect from a company like Disney whom prides itself on customer service.I'm trying to get this word out to as many people as I can. I'm hoping that there would be some accountability for the Disneyland staff regarding the way they treat people with mobility disabilities because I have heard this from multiple people regarding their Disneyland vs their Disney world experiences since this trip. I am not recommending this trip to others in my situation. I typed this whole email with my eyes and has taken me several hours, but I really feel like it is worth my time so that hopefully no one else has to experience what I did and also hopefully the staff will be better equipped on handling special circumstances."
"I thoroughly enjoy my Original Disneyland 1955 in California.  I have been to many Disney parks around the world‚Ä¶ but there is something about our Original Dream of Walt Disney.  Last night was Sweethearts Nite‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt going to go solo, but ended up going anyway.  Disneyland Resort does many special events thru the year."
"Terrible Disney experience. No disney all star parade ,  no fireworks show. WTF,  and super tiny castle .every thing looks agates and very old school."
I went here for a day.  I only went to Disneyland and not the other park.  It there is any place that makes you feel like a kid again this would be it. It was really crowded but I went on some rides.  I first went here in the 1970s and it brings back a lot of my youth. Really great.
I‚Äôm writing as a very frustrated and disappointed mother of a 44 year old man with several major disabilities.  He is completely deaf and almost fully blind and has numerous other physical challenges.  He has a service dog that guides him or he uses a white cane and has to hang on to one of us.  We have come to Disneyland numerous times in the past and he has always had accommodations that have made for a wonderful time.  Due to his disabilities this is the only family vacation that we go on that he can enjoy.  Even though he can‚Äôt see or hear he gets the thrill of the movement.  When we went to disability services last night to organize a disability pass for today we were told he did not meet the criteria for being unable to stand in a line up.  Disneyland has changed their disability access program to only include those with autism or other cognitive impairments.  We were told our son could sit aside with a family member and meet up at a point along the way.  We are here as a group of 7 and we decided this would once again ostracize Ryan so we would all stay together.  So we did and it was a very frustrating day as he stumbled through the line ups and we all felt frustrated.  Just imagine for a minute being in an hour long line up and having no sensory input!  Their new disability pass criteria is absolutely ridiculous and needs to be changed!
"Such a great, amazing experience! We got two-day tickets both days with lighting passes. Expensive, but worth every penny. If you‚Äôre a first timer like us, we highly recommend that you spend a whole day at each park because there is so much to see and so much to do, each park honestly deserves its own day to appreciate all they have to offer. Disneyland has more rides, but less adventurous ones, California Adventure has less rides but of course, the iconic Incredicoaster which we loveddddd. Such a fun, amazing experience!! We went mid January and there was still so much foot traffic, but can‚Äôt expect too much out of that. We missed the fireworks on both days because each day we went the fireworks were at the opposite park, but the World of Color was soooooo beautiful it made me emotional lol. I loved every minute of both days!"
"We visited  during Christmas week and have mixed feelings about our visit. While we absolutely love the parks, most of the rides, the characters, and history of the park, we detest the Disney greed. They demand an arm, a leg, and your first born for ticket cost nowadays,  and we feel like they nickel and dime us with the extra fees. We purchased the Lightning  Lane Pass for the multiple days we were there and that was a mistake. Definitely not worth it for more than one day and the price just went up another 10+%. The issue is that not all rides are eligible, and then rather than allowing one to plan the whole day in advance and pick all the rides at once, one has to wait 2 hours after picking the first ride and so on. The main Star Wars ride is not eligible BTW, and one has to pay extra on top of the Lightning Lane Pass (the cost is almost as much as the LLP just for one ride). The food is awful no matter which place you pick, and the best place to eat is Starbucks and that is not saying much as it is mediocre at best. The popcorn was burnt, and the only snack worth buying is the churro. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. We remember having far better visits at Disneyland... I'm sure old Walt wouldn't be happy with our experience at the park the lat couple of times we visited. We will visit less often if this greed and lack of better organization continues."
"Our family, 2 grandparents, mom,dad and 2 young children, age 6 and 9. visited Disneyland the 2nd week of December. We had breakfast in our hotel, Best Western Stovall Inn.  A short walk to the park. The park was very crowded. Long lines for the most popular place rides. We went to both parks over 4 days. The rides did disappoint. We had made dinner reservations for the 4 days. My wife had to use a powered scooter which was hard maneuvering in the crowds. The staff at all the rides were very helpful with my wife. The trip was expensive but we new that going in. It was the crowds that surprised us. One thing my wife and I did was take 50 yr. old menu, from the Blue Bayou that we were given in 1974 on a vist. The manager was surprised to see it. All in all we had a great time and would go again."
"We had 3 days at Disneyland Jan 13-15, 225 with two kids ages 8 and 10. We rode 55 rides in three days with a single park a day and lightning lane. We say over a dozen characters and ate once a day at the park, TicketsüéüÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏èWe had originally booked a good neighbour package and then cancelled due to the fires. We ended up rebooking and still going but staying at a closer hotel. We had trouble rebooking and spent hours on the phone with Disney. They were helpful but just painful their system gives Canadians postal codes an issue and box numbers for payment. Because of that we had a few issues at check in each morning as we had reservation dr codes and ticketsSecurity‚ò∫Ô∏è‚¨áÔ∏èWe checked in to the park each day from the east side gate (Toy Story drop off) and stayed at the Hyatt house hotel 3 blocks south. We never had to wait more than 3 minutes to go through security. It was definitely slow season. We went for rope drop daily and stayed until 12-1 pm then went back between 6-7 pm The only issue we had was they took mySelfie stick the very last day I didn‚Äôt even remember I had in there the whole time we went through. You can take coffee and water and snacks into Disney. We did as we went straight 2 hours of rides from 8-10 am without any breaks to maximize the short lines Foodüç± ‚¨áÔ∏èWe loved the churros, the pretzels were not hot and fresh, we ate at horseshoe and it was ok, we did Mobile pick up snacks into toontown and they were good but 5 mini donuts was$6, we ate in cars land at flos diner and that was the best meal of the time in Disney. Downtown Disney we ate at the bowling alley and that was really good and reasonable price (shared a pizza and burger) and then we ate offsite at Tony romas (ok) and Cheesecake Factory (great) We picked up some snacks at cvs and 7-11 and target. lightning Laneüî•‚¨áÔ∏èWe maximized this. We watched a YouTube video on it (just search lighting lane Disneyland and the first guy comes up is Parks guys) and we used his tips. We booked all the rides that broke down and got magical select experience tickets that came in handy later at night when the lines were long and we wanted to ride rides again.Disneyland ‚ù§Ô∏è‚¨áÔ∏èWe did two days here. Monday and Wednesday. First day we did 16 rides and saw 5 characters. We did rope drop Monday and went straight to Tomorrowland. Star tours was broken so we got a pass for that walked on astroblasters, then walked on space mountain. We did autopia, no,  and bobsleds all before 10Am. Then we headed over to galaxy and did that area before taking a break until evening. We felt by 1 pm We were hungry, tired and our feet were getting tired (18,000 steps by 1pm!) so we we r back each day until after dinner. If you don‚Äôt do the show at 930 you can walk on rise resistance. We were too tired but used LL for Indiana snd big mountain and a few other rides again. One tip is to watch those select multi pass tickets from broken rides. If you break down mid ride get a new pass as they are good for almost all but rise resistance. . If you pre book a LL and the ride goes down while you‚Äôre waiting you get a select pass which wasn‚Äôt good for all. Like Roger rabbit broke down a lot but the select ticket wasn‚Äôt good for space mountain or materhorn or Indiana jones. Indiana jones and space mountain have no LL left by 6 pm I found so make sure to book those earlier. California Adventure  ‚¨áÔ∏èüòçWe did rope drop daily and had a game plan and quickly pivoted when everyone went to cars in California we decided to do Pixar pier and rode 10 rides in 2 hours. We ended up doing single passenger to get on cars within 15 minutes at night and then didn‚Äôt again when the line was only 20Minutes. We enjoy webslingers a lot and the girls love goofy flight school (rode it 5 times!) and soarin and symphony swings. My youngest wanted to do incredible as - I screamed the whole time but I survived. The things we do for our kidsWe never did guardians of galaxy as we all agreed that wasn‚Äôt out jam.  Mater was so fun we did twice and of course Ariel is classic and the Ferris wheel, inside out was down for refurbishment."
Every child‚Äôs dream comes true here. Expensive but worth it. It‚Äôs open 8am to midnight and a lot of rides after the fireworks have short or no wait lines for rides.The Star Wars rides were outstanding
"We enjoyed spending time in Disney  ,, we were able to carry water with us avoiding higher park prices  ,, rides were well maintained,,  short lines ,, earlier in the day ,, light snack bars good choice to carry  ,,"
"Visited on New Year's Eve so expected both parks to be busy - which they were.  We had a fabulous time but were disappointed and rather surprised at the number of rides that just stopped working, either while we were waiting in the queue, or in a couple of cases, while we were actually on the rides.  Even the train stopped at a station and everyone was just told to get off and walk.  In all cases, no information was given as to what was wrong with the ride and if/when it would re-start.  Not what we would have expected from Disneyland - and was disappointing given the huge cost of the tickets at that time of the year (especially for those of us from countries where the exchange rate is terrible).  Also was really disappointing to find out that, despite paying extra for lightning passes, we had to pay even more to use them for certain rides - which we really couldn't afford to do as a family of four. Would have been good to have had this highlighted when we purchased the passes."
"As part of our 50th birthday tour we spent 2 days in Disneyland.  We had been previously before Galaxy's Edge was opened.  This was the reason for our return visit and also to enjoy some of the rides we loved the first time around.  Galaxy's Edge was amazing and my Daughter and I did the Savi Lightsaber building which was an awesome experience.  The only downside was the amount of breakdowns on the rides, it got to the point where we made a joke about it and blamed each other as the unlucky ones who caused it.  Pretty much everything we went on broke down, by the end of the two days it was pretty funny.  Only disappointing one was the Rise of the Resistance, which we managed to get to with a minimum wait time.  Got to board the transport and then made it into the imperial landing bay before the ride died.  Was given a pass to get back onto the ride but unfortunately it wasn't back up and running before we left.  With the outlay you need to go to Disney, especially when you dollar is crap, it is a shame that so manner of the rides breakdown on a regular basis."
"We went there at 5am so we could avoid traffic and it kind of worked, most of the rides are more baby friendly in the park rather than the adventure. I would recommend getting lighting pass and if your going with kids that like more exciting rides i would recommend the adventure park."
"This is our first visit in 11 years.  Went as a family of 4.  There are two parks here, DisneyLand and California Adventure.  We prefer Disney as it has the Star Wars area and so many great rides.  The food options are decent.  Things are pricey but overall its a very well run park."
"I was sold for dated tickets to disneyland not possible to use in the dates marked.  I‚Äôm in the awful process of requesting a refund, but have not got an answer yet.They sell you tickets for use when the park is not granting any more access due to high occupancy.  So, guess what happened‚Ä¶ no park, but paid tickets.   Ohh, almost forgot, also expired tickets now!!"
"I've been visiting Disneyland Park for countless years since I was a kid. This last visit in December has shown that this park is basically just for nostalgia and not for actual value. I had the privilege of being a pass member at Disneyland Paris when I lived in France two years ago so I got to know that park very well. Returning to the original felt like it was a shell and mini version of the other Disney parks. Everything feels so tiny a put right next to each other creating many bottle necks. I felt like cattle traversing the park and even began to feel claustrophobic. Some of the attractions are great such as the two new Star Wars rides, Indiana Jones, and Space Mountain but the rest were lame/inferior versions of what could be found at the Paris resort. The nail in the coffin was the very generic fireworks show. I was expecting some projections and singing by characters on the castle. It was literally just music playing and fireworks in the sky. I felt this show could've been any fireworks show put on the 4th of July. $500 for two tickets plus the lightning lane multi-passes for one park, not to mention the $35 parking made this not worth it at all. I don't understand how people still hype this place, it truly is a ripoff."
"Cool place to hangout with your grandchildren when you are over 50. It was fun amazingly. Yep few fumbles are always lying there, but you gotta go, as long as the children love it."
"It‚Äôs unlikely that anyone from the organization will read this, but here are a few real points to consider.Allow extra time for bag screening. There seems to be an issue with their system, as the process runs smoothly in the morning but can take up to 30 minutes after 4 PM. Despite fewer people in line, security seems to be slower, possibly due to newer staff or overzealous screening.  Rude staff The Disney app‚Äôs character listings are often outdated. It‚Äôs frustrating to see characters listed on the app, only to find out they‚Äôre not available that day. Cast members are then instructed to make up corny excuses to maintain the illusion, which feels deceptive.Expect long lines at food and restaurants, and be prepared for high prices. As with most theme parks, the food is overpriced, and unfortunately, the quality has noticeably declined.Cast member interactions have changed. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs due to the current climate or a sense of entitlement, but many cast members no longer seem as charming as they once were. They can come off as more demanding and pushy compared to previous visits."
