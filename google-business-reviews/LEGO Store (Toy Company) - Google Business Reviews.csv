"It was the safest shop I entered or at least where I felt the most safe.There was a very friendly member of staff at the door making sure there wasn't too many people inside the shop in order to observe social distancing. Then would offer hand sanitiser before we went in.The staff in store were so polite and friendly making sure social distancing is observed and that includes how certain items in the shop can or not be touched.And to finalise, Mark, excellent customer service. Polite and interested in what I had to say. Making sure my 3 year old could leave the store happy with the collectable miniature lego figure  that comes in a package, as a surprise, so one never knows what you'll be getting. My son wanted the green one and he went in the back of store and after a while came back and it was the green lego figure, to my sons delight, he found it!Taking the extra for an excellent customer service, where customer feels welcomed, even when one knows nothing about Lego (nMe!), there was a friendly smile even behind masks.We will certainly be back!",2023-01-07
"Today was the worst day for me and the kids, I love coming to the Lego store.  We also like buying legos in Stratford as most of the staff here are very friendly, but on 13th April there was a female staff who was very unfriendly.  When I checked out, I saw a Lego card on the counter and asked the female clerk to ask for one for my child.  Because that card was beautiful and my other kid wanted it too, so I asked the clerk to give me another one.  But the female clerk immediately said no with a stern face, and kept talking in a low voice, feeling like she was scolding me.  Not sure if I'm asking too much or the LEGOs I bought today are too cheap treated like this，If it's because I'm asking too much, you can tell me that you don't need to give me a long face.  Feeling discriminated against, is this how Lego stores treat customers?",2023-01-03
"Started getting into Lego since I visited Legoland Windsor last October.Wonderful shop with so much variety on offer (appealing to both kids and adults alike), and it didn't take me long at all to find two sets that caught my eye; Bird's Nest and Valentine Lovebirds (see photo).George served me at the counter today; very friendly and even convinced me to join the Lego VIP rewards club (free to join!)Sadly I don't live locally to Stratford, otherwise I would definitely come here again on a near-regular basis. Highly recommend to all fans of Lego and anyone seeking to fuel their creativity 🌈",2023-01-04
A lovely store with friendly staff and lots of great model displays which helped with a couple of purchases. Their Lego brick wall ( a huge section that usually holds lots of bricks to purchase) was however not even half stocked which was disappointing. This was my first visit to a Lego store with the pick a brick wall being one of my primary reasons to do so. Seeing it so understocked simply means I won't need to visit any Lego store again as I'm better off getting specific bricks for my projects from other sources.,2023-01-03
"Attentive staff. We are handed alcohol gel at the entrance. Shown a 3D augmented reality model of Lego a TV screen which is super cool. Browsed the store without feeling the pressure to buy anything. We asked a question on if we were able to order a specific Lego piece that we are missing on a set we had bought, and were given a business card with who to contact. So nice, pleasant experience throughout. At the checkout we were asked to join their mail list, and we were given a keychain for joining!!!",2023-01-07
"Love the Lego store in Westfield Stratford, went there just yesterday, had so much fun and the staff there is amazing. There's one member of staff, I think her name is Rachel, that I hope gets paid well for the service she gives, she was such a lovely person and really gave my sisters a good experience going to the store. Oh and the builds you see in the cabinets there are incredibly creative and funny. Can't wait to go to this store again.",2023-01-03
"Being an adult Lego fan, I was disappointed with the store.Except for a few features such as the brick wall (which everyone who has ever visited the wall knows is disappointing due to the lack of variety) and the figure creation point (also disappointing for the same reasons as the wall), Hamleys had a greater stock of children's Lego. Disappointed that a main store such as this did not stock the more expensive models such as the Bugatti...",2023-01-06
"Nice shopping for tots amazing , all kinds of toys available for kids use. Fresh toys, fresh sports , gaming as well. Toy's for high quality and advanced technology , mix toys  for toddler's, babies and above age. Also parking available, staff is very helpful.

"Official Lego store with lot of options to buy mega blocks. Even good for adults not only for kids. There are big blocks start at around €50-100, there are micro blocks also which kids can enjoy too.Good for learning and also makes kids thinking about the estate and building knowledge. How to join and build things is something kids may learn. It's decent and staff is good to show you the best options.",2023-01-03
Just a big thank you to the staff being kind enough to help me out!

"A huge store full of everything from the Lego brand in a huge shopping mall in London, there are all kinds of Lego creations, it is possible to buy certain parts according to choice, and there are a lot of options in the place, a dream store for children to visit the place, highly recommended, the prices are not cheap at all",2023-01-07
"Good variety of legos, some of them I had never seen before. For a creative mind, Lego is a good outlet. At the same time, I think in order to make money, Lego is coming up with pieces to build a specific design, that puts some restrictions on the creativity, as specific pieces are to be used as per the design given",2023-01-02
"Great staff! We went on boxing day and they were out of a lot, understandably so, so we asked an employee for the catalogue to order from and even though they were super busy he went to the back and found a catalogue for us to browse through.

He helped me swap a set of lego someone got me as a gift that I already had.",2023-01-07
"Bright, colourful, excellent staff - especially a lovely lady called Tahmina - above my expectations and a fun Easter egg hunt around the displays (even if I'm a bit old for it). It was expensive but thats how Lego is but for a smaller store it was definitely worth it!",2023-01-03
One member of staff who I did not get the name of was amazing he helped my 5 year old son get his lego book. He searched high and low for a good amount of time. He made my sons first lego shop experience amazing. Can't thank you enough. Really appreciate the service🤩,2023-01-07
