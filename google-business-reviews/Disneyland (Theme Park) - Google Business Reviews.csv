"Disneyland visit for whole family including grandchildren 9/16/23  - 9/21/23.  Halloween themed decorations along with standard Disney signature decorating very nice.  The live entertainment in California Adventures was very good!  Spiderman, Wakanda Forever, Dr. Strange and the, fun, Guardians of the Galaxy Dance Off!!!   I would say it was one of the highlights of our visit.  These folks do a great job.  Most all the cast members exceeded the challenging job of staying kind, helpful and calm amid hordes of people needing and wanting different things and help.  Mobile food ordering is good.  Once we got the timing down, it was a great way not to waste time in, yet another, long line.  This brings me to the things we found “un-Magical” during our stay.  We spent extra $$ for Genie+ service for each ticket, each day.  Purchased Magicband+ for each person to maximize ease of joining attractions, reduce our time spent in lines (especially with little ones) and the promise of fun, interactive encounters that would cause the Magicband+ to react by lighting/vibrating.  All this is set up with your mobile device. I found myself spending too much time on my phone. Trying to “design” our Disney day was a challenge.  You can't reserve more than one ride within a certain time frame. Not all rides allow Lightening Lane and some require extra $$ on top of what you've already paid for LL, like the new Tune Town ride.  The standard wait for this ride was about 90min.  Imagine waiting in line with little ones for 90min!  Can any ride even live up to its expectation after a 2hr wait?? The standard lines are unbelievably long. You expect lines, but it sucks the fun and “magic” right out of your family when you must wait over an hour.  To add insult to injury, many of the rides broke down mid-ride!  We had to be escorted off two different rides in one day! In all the years I have come to Disneyland, that had never happened before. At CA Adventures after waiting 2hr for Radiator Springs, we finally got seated and it broke down half way through. We had to wait for help and be escorted, walking single file, through the ride. They tell you to come back when the ride is fixed and they will try to reduce your wait. But the ride broke 1 ½ hrs. before the park closed.  What were the chances they would get all of us back on the ride that night?  When would it even be fixed? This was roughly 3hrs of our day that we could not get back.  Rides would show a “wait time” of 30min. then become 1hr. because of malfunctions while we were waiting.  We missed other things we had reserved because of lines being unpredictable. Also, it was quite noticeable that many rides would just come to a stop mid-ride and you would sit there while the animation and sounds, and voices just stopped, like the ride was broken.  Indiana Jones did this twice for a prolonged period during some of the most intense moments of the ride.  When I told the cast member that the ride had malfunctioned while we were on it, she stated that they must slow the ride or pause it for some reason I did not understand.  But after checking with another cast member, we got the same reaction, like it was just “how it goes.”  It seems that there are too many guests on any given day at the park and despite how kind the cast members are, they cannot fix the problems of broken rides and the staggering, sheer volume of people.  It is seemingly impossible to maintain the “Disney Magic” under such circumstances.  I wish they had a more straightforward system of Lightening Lane passes.  The model that Universal Studios has, although more expensive, is more simplistic, straightforward, and satisfying at the end of the day.  We had some great moments during our visit, but until Disneyland gets a grip on the problems in the park, I would not recommend spending the money.  I know I will not be back for a long time, if ever. The hype and great memories of past experiences I’ve had go a long way, but I felt frustrated and sad that the high standards and “magic” Disney is known for, seems to be gone right now.",2023-01-04
"Disney has bots creating 5-star reviews. They’re all the same comment. READ THE HONEST REVIEWSIf you’re a Disney die-hard, easily impressed,  have kids, OK maybe. If you’re from far away, as a bucket list item, have expectations, or an amusement park enthusiast, hoping to be blown away by something unique, I would NOT recommend it.I’m not a “Disney Person” so I’m unbiased and wasn’t excited about going here, but my wife said she had a great time here back in 2012 and insisted we try again.If you are a Die-Hard fan, check it out if you’re in the area, but I would NEVER plan an entire vacation around this place. I can’t believe people spend thousands to bring an entire family here. You could go to Europe for probably the same price. 9 hrs and we had 8 rides (30min) plus the Monorail.The GOOD:Some of the rides are actually kind of fun. The rollercoaster rides are “decent”. The Matterhorn Bobsled, Incredicoaster, Thunder Railroad, all worth trying IF the lines are short.  Indiana Jones & Star Wars were OK.There’s bathrooms and water fountains and various food stops all over with pretty affordable (vegan) options, different cuisines, and seating. We saw 2 or 3 mascots walking around interacting, including Kylo Ren. The park seemed pretty clean, and the app was handy.The BAD:Our tickets were $150usd. Apparently there’s no capacity limit. The place was PACKED.The lineups are horrendous. And we went on a Tuesday, Sept 26 at 8am open. You will stand in the sun for an average of 30-45 min for a 3 minute ride. Some were 15-20min but some over 1.5hrs.The lines never seem to end. They start outside, go into different rooms, up stairs, double back and zig zag all over, so you never know how far you have left. You turn a corner and hope to see the end but it’s always more line. It’s probably worth considering the Lightning pass, but I don’t know the details.Most of the wait estimates in the Disney App were fairly accurate, but the lines are dynamic so don’t rely on the app. (Everyone will flock to the short lines and the wait jumps from 20 to 45 minutes).There’s very little shade, and absolutely no seating in any of the lines. How hard is it to put up a canvas shade and a couple benches?!Some of the rides are WAY too loud. The sound effects and voiceovers are obnoxiously deafening. If this was an industrial work environment, it would be deemed hazardous and you would wear hearing protection. Not to mention kids screaming in your ear, but I’ll let that slide.Several rides shut down for mechanical issues, Including Indiana Jones while we were at the front of the line. Space mountain wasn’t open. Avengers closed early.Some of the actors were very unenthusiastic. The StarWars “First Order” troops were all softspoken and it was hard to hear their instructions, let alone believe their roles. Many workers were just slack-wrist waving us into formations and not giving any real direction. There is very little signage around the park. You have to use the App for direction and just start walking.Speaking of walking, there’s no real practical transit system, even though there’s a monorail, trolleys, a railroad, and a parking garage shuttle. It’s just as practical to walk the entire park.Some of the sets/mannequins/special effects were just plain corny and cheap. It seemed every ride had only one or two “main features”.  The Pirates of the Caribbean was a bunch of plastic skeletons and freaky, robotic pirates lifting a sword/musket/bottle, or turning their head, while a few lights flashed around or mild splashes flicked water. The Star Wars ride had a few more lights and flashes, a 3D flight, and more mostly stationary mannequins.The Indians Jones ride had just one “interactive” feature.I expected more from a company with as much money as Disney.The food is pretty heavy. Don’t expect anything healthy. Not terrible though.  The lines for some food weren’t much better than the rides. Our wrap was fast, but Dole Whip on the app we still had to wait 30 minutes for our pickup time… for a Dole Whip…30 minutes!!",2023-01-07
"Going right when it opens and leaving when it closes will cause you and anyone you bring the worst waiting to get in and out of anywhere you've ever experienced.The park has remained the same on magic in its rides and entertainment, (other than they have a LOT more breakdowns these days...cough, cough, Radiator Springs). There's only one, MAJOR thing that overshadows a good experience here now.Since they canceled Fast Passes simply to generate more revenue regardless of ruining customer experience, you'll now see much more line crowders of large groups pushing past families throughout the entire line. It happens quite a lot without consequence for the offenders, so be prepared. What was once a brilliant system that maintained genius crowd control is now gone. The overcrowded parks had a good flow of movement before where lots of good shopping could take place in between rides because of the free Fast Passes. Now the super packed crowds are stuck in super long queues and on the trails to get to these queues.By doing this, their executives created a system that encourages line crowding and didn't devise a way to report line crowders. They've also very cruelly made sure standby lines move as slow as possible by only letting a painfully small amout of Standby people go on the ride at a time, regardless of how much space is available right at the ride. They hold off for those with purchased ""fast passes"". Fair enough for the couples with these passes because they didn't have to pay for children to get them but the 50 Lightning Lane to 15 Standby lane getting on the ride is just corporate bullying to drive sales over quality service. Arguably the number one thing that ruined the ""Happiest Place on Earth"" was getting rid of fast passes. Cast Members even seem more upset as they are on the front lines of dealing with angry customers more than ever before.Now if you want a semi-faster way to get on the rides, you'll need to purchase ""fast passes"" newly named Lightning Lane. I repeat, Lightning Lane,  not Genie+. Without purchasing Lightning Lane passes, you'll need to bring devices to entertain youth, (and yourself), while waiting in the excessively long queues. Nothing about Disney's new amusement park price increases were designed to stop overcrowded parks so be ready.There's also the newly deceptive, seemingly useless, and way too expensive  Genie+ pass. Anyone telling you to get this because it's a life saver, visited the pubs at the parks first, got wasted, and don't remember much of anything other than being drunk at Disneyland. This seems  to  only exist as a poorly thought-out idea of some executive to show they can squeeze more money from customers without really giving them anything in return. Save your money on this one as we found ourselves still not able to get on the main rides or much of anything without waiting in Standby lanes. We found out it's individual Lightning Lane passes that you absolutely need to get on the main rides. There's a difference between Genie+ and Lightning Lane passes so pay attention to what you're buying and read the fine print.It's become an extremely expensive destination, so have your vacation savings doubled up if you're an average family of average income. Of course, we didn't have the energy to shop after waiting in long queues all day when our Genie+ passes turned out to be a flop, so I didn't get to look at those prices. Disneyland will always be popular because of its legacy across the planet so people of all income levels will always flock there; especially now that humans are free to roam the world again after being closed in for two-three years.  Choose days less are willing to go there like on rainy days and/or major holidays so you can hopefully get what you paid for.",2023-01-05
"Wir (4 Personen) waren in beiden Parks, je einen Tag und hatten Genius+ (USD 25,--/Person) dazu gebucht.. Ist zwar sehr teuer, aber ohne wäre der Park sinnlos, da man sich sonst nur die Füße in den Bauch steht. Es sind soooo viele Leute dort, viele mit Kinderwagen oder Rollwagen, damit haben wir Mitte September nicht mehr gerechnet. Beim Eingang am besten gleich einen Plan in Papierform besorgen, so toll, dass es diesen noch gibt, damit bekommt man einen guten Überblick. Nur mit der App wäre das mühsam. Die App selbst ist sehr wichtig: Man sieht die Anstellzeiten und kann dann dementsprechendreagieren und dorthin gehen, inzwischen die Fastlane für eine Fahrt buchen. Ganz stimmen die Zeiten aber nicht, im Normalfall kommen noch einige Minuten Wartezeit dazu. Mit dem Genius+ pass kann man immer nur EINE Attraktion im voraus buchen, daher am besten immer sehen, wo in nächster Zeit ein Zeitfenster offen ist, gleich buchen und hingehen. Wenn man reingeht, kann man gleich das nächste buchen. Hat echt gut geklappt und wir konnten viele Fahrten in kurzer Zeit machen! Die tollen Attraktionen waren bereits morgens bis in den Nachmittag hinein ausgebucht, diese haben wir dann gemütlich am Nachmittag für abends vor der Abendshow gebucht. Man kann leider nicht alles machen und so sollte man wirklich im Vorfeld planen, was einem wichtig ist.Für die neue StarWars Fahrt gab es keine Möglichkeit der FastLane, auch nicht SingleLane. Man konnte entweder 1 – 1 ½ Stunden warten oder extra nochmals USD 25,--/Person aufzahlen. Anfangs dachten wir nur Abzocke, aber wenn man nun schon mal da ist… mit Handy eine Zeit gebucht, man konnten gleich hinein…. und das war die beste Attraktion EVER, man bekommt hier wirklich etwas geboten!Souvenirs waren viel zu überteuert, z.b. ein süsser Babyjoda aus Plüsch USD 43,-- + Tax, daher nichts gekauft.Als eher unfreundlich empfanden wir die dort angestellten Fotografen, sie waren gefühlt überall und haben uns des öfteren gesagt, wir sollen hier weg.Gegessen habe wir im Park nur etwas für den kleinen Hunger (Pizzaschnitte ca USD 9,--). Wir hatten das Best Western Hotel gleich wenn man aus dem Disney-Bereich raus kommt – näher geht es nicht. Nebenan Burger gekauft, im Zimmer gegessen, kurz ausgeruht und wieder in den Park zur Lichtershow. Ein anstrengender, aber unvergesslicher Tag!",2023-01-05
"We go to Disneyland every few years, but this trip was different and we had some hiccups. Still a magical place and love and highly recommend but wanted to bring up some comments since they didn't allow me to provide feedback this time around. After our world of color desert package reservation at 8pm on Sept 25 (which highly recommend the desert package), we were leaving and came across Mickey Mouse near the circle in Adventure Park. We waited over 15 minutes in line for my kid to see Mickey. When we were about 2 people away, we were told he had to leave (the female employee running the line was not very sympathetic and didn't care that we had waited so long). I wish they would have stopped the line so we didn't have to waste our time. Plus my kid was so disappointed. She held up her signature book as Mickey went by but nothing. I assume he didn't see her because of his costume. We never did get to see Mickey the remainder of the trip. Oh well.. not the happiest. It kind of was par for the day. Earlier that morning, it did not turn out so well for my daughter. My daughter age 8 wears a size 10 and we could not fit her in the Ariel outfit (size 12) she wanted for her Bippity Boppity appointment. They only had one adaptive outfit (Cinderella) that would not work well with her in a wheelchair as it was very puffy and I know the fabric would continually get caught in the wheels.They did give me a refund and charged for the lower package which was a t-shirt, ponytail and makeup so all was not lost. However, we had done the other package before (3 years earlier) and had a photo shoot in a costume with a coach, etc Plus I recall, we went through and she got to meet the princesses. So this time was disappointing since none of that was included. We did go to the Disneystore afterwards to try to find her an Ariel outfit and we did find one for her which was an adaptive Ariel outfit. We also found an Ariel attachment for the wheelchair. Just in time for Halloween.",2023-01-03
"One of the worst experiences ever. My family & I invested in the genie + pass in hopes of a better, faster experience. Wrong. This place needs work & some REAL organization. This place is hungry for money. I never thought Disneyland (Happiest place on earth) would be this stingy. I tried to stay positive for my family but I honestly feel bad for them for wasting so much money on a terrible experience. To go more in depth, the cars radiator springs ride doesn’t even include genie +, it’s an extra $20.00 more to add the lightning express pass. Therefore our pass was not eligible; and we stood in the general line for TWO hours (wait said 90 mins) and the ride kept breaking down a plethora of times. Didn’t even get to ride it, waste of time. If the ride hasn’t been working all morning I’d recommend shutting it down and doing some real maintenance on it. Not only was it the cars ride. The goofy flying school was closed, the Spider-Man ride was closed, and now currently waiting for the Guardians of Galaxy & now the ride is experiencing a code 302 (2 carts are now broken!!) AGAIN FIX THE PLACE! With the genie + we were only allowed to make reservations for THREE RIDES. Not only that. I tried to book rides that had shorter waits & the app told me I had reached my exceeded amount of booking ride reservations. Waste of money. Do something about it seriously. I am furious honeslty, will hesitate to come again & will make sure others who consider know what they’re getting themselves into. Everyone who came on October 8, 2023 should really get a refund for how many rides were broken & for the lack of maintenance. Another note, the park closes at 6 for the Oogie Boogie bash. So yeah time and money wasted. Genie + lightning passes apparently sell out and if they’re all booked you can’t use your PAID genie + for the ride. Annoying.OTHER NOTE: (so many things happened today it’s RIDICULOUS) the genie + only lets you book one attraction at a time",2023-01-05
"My first time being here as an adult was WOW. Where do I begin? I stayed at the Tropicana across the street, which was awesome from the room to the Staff Amazing Five stars to them! Disneyland 1#. Employees seem like robots they will tell you what you wanna hear when you want to hear it. However, you wanna hear it. They seem like very miserable, especially standing for HOURS. I even heard employees talking about using the restrooms multiple times just to sit down. I even asked an employee if you really liked your job face impression. Hell no, but then replied, ""Oh yes, they have multiple things to do to keep us busy."" 2# everywhere you go is PACKED and CROWDED with tons of people from getting food,  restrooms,  getting pictures taken , waiting in super long lines which paying for lightning pass has its times yes its worth paying for and sometimes it feels very pointless like why did I buy this when I can only use it for once every 2 hours! 🤣. Long lines for the restrooms / food court / shops / Rides / Picture taking / the entrance you get the idea . 3#. People who stand in line only to save spots for large numbers either for friends or family you could be in a line thinking that you are next up only to find out that six or nine people who are saying excuse me from behind you only because a person they know is in front of you for the ride this happened  to me a hand full of times 😡 and employees don't ever say anything especially if you are in the lightning lane! 4# The parks seem more crowded during the night 🌙 vs. during the day, I'm not sure why, Parents don't seem to keep their kids in line, and this can be either laying on the ground , crying nonstop , bumping into other guests and not having a care in the world the list goes on all I can really say is just be prepared when going! I will be returning for sure and hopefully have a better experience 😁.",2023-01-06
"Our experience this time was a bit less than magical. The dining system that was put in place over the last few years is very broken. We bought our tickets about a month before our visit. I knew that dining at our favorite restaurant, Blue Bayou, was going to be a bit tricky with the short lead time. What I wasn't expecting was that all table service at the park was now on the Disney Dining reservation system and would all be completely booked out a month prior to our arrival. We had to leave the park to get a nice meal. Something I noticed while at the park was that the restaurants have different hours than the park does. This is dumb! When we got there, we thought breakfast might be nice. The breakfast places don't open until 11am. What's that all about? The park opened at 8am. We did eventually find some breakfast in Fantasyland once that location opened up for the day.OK, Disneyland was open from 8AM-12AM. River Belle Terrace(formerly a popular breakfast place) is open from 11:30AM-8PM. Blue Bayou is open from 11AM to 10PM. Cafe Orleans is open from 11:30AM-8PM. The reason the dining reservations were not available was because the popular restaurants are at capacity during the limited hours they are open and closed while people are still at the park. They have created scarcity by limiting the hours. Also, the menus have changed. They have been simplified by removing all but a few items. We have been to Disney World and Disneyland Paris in the last few years and did not have an experience like this even with their dining reservation system in place.I think I'm done with Disneyland for a while. I have great memories there as a local kid but I worry that those memories will tarnish if I continue watching the park and guest experience decline. There are other amusement parks and even other Disney parks that can provide a better experience.",2023-01-01
"Awful. Besides a few rides, most of the rides aren't worth the wait at all. It gets way to crowded to even enjoy some of the rides as it gets way too cramped and way too crowded to really appreciate the scenery unless you'rethere early. The bathrooms are gross and unclean and the idk about the other bathrooms but the star wars bathroom I went to had no mirrors except for one badly lit, 2 person mirror that had a little line near the entrance. The stores all have the same boring simple stuff, it is very repetitive. I recommend getting your own Disney related stuff elsewhere such as ears and clothes. They hardly had a selection when it came to which movie you liked. Seems like they took away certain things because they were deemed slightly offensive or ""unwoke"". They even had pride stuff despite the lack of characters they have promoted for merchandise, and a random mini Whitehouse and room dedicated to Abraham Lincoln. It is confusing and there are no signs to really point you in the right direction besides landmarks and the names of each land unless you really spend time looking at the map. Everything is insanely overpriced, especially the legos. I've gotten the lego bonsai botanical set for 34 bucks at Barnes and noble whereas here it was whopping $134. I highly recommend getting there early or getting the lightning pass to speed up lines. Quite a few rides were out of order and after all that walking the monorail was out of order as well due to heat. Had to walk 30 minutes to my hotel room. So don't go on hot days either I suppose. Overall, the prices, the walking, the rides, and the lines, didn't feel like it was worth my time and the experience here was disappointing. I recommend saving your money and time for the one in Florida if you really want the Disney experience.",2023-01-05
"Myself & another friend went to Disney land LA for the first time in our lives & the experience over all was very underwhelming… At least for myself.You grow up your whole life hearing about this magical place and its experience but when you get there it’s just a regular theme park like any other place. The lines are unbearable, everything cost money when you are already putting in ALOT of money down just to have a decent time. The staff over all are just bored annoyed employees that call themselves cast members,they rush you and I understand it’s due to the high demand of customers but where is the magic? Where had it all gone?The SMELL in general was the absolute worst I used to hear about the park setting off wonderful smells throughout the park to entice guest and create wonder memories but now the park just absolutely reeks of human waste & it’s not an exaggeration. Not to mention the foul water that they have running through their pipes in order to get you to buy cold fresh water, I understand faucet water isn’t the best but my god that water running through those pipes might as well have come from their water rides.As all the 1 star comments before mine previously states , they NEED TO limit the amount of people that are going into the park for the day & maybe then with the employees not getting so overwhelmed THE MAGIC of Disney land can start to come back…it all must start somewhere.I would honestly be fine not coming back for another couple years if not more,it’s not that fantastic but if you’d like to spend time with family and hold your breath along with spending hundreds of dollars then by all means I hope you have a wonderful ,Disney full ,magical experience of your own.",2023-01-03
"UPDATE as of October 2023: this place is definitely tired and run down. It makes me sad because we have been here a few times and have the best memories, but clearly the new management is not maintaining the Disney quality we loved. The staff was rude!!! Rude!! At Disney. They were annoyed and just fed up, understandable. It is so packed you cannot move, or breathe. Everyone is so angry, so overwhelmed, this has some how become the most miserable place on earth now. It is the absolute worst. The lines are 2 hours long, or you pay for lightning pass and it doesn’t matter because the coolest rides don’t accept lightning passes. We waited in line 50 mins for  radiator springs racers and they shut them down, out of order. Too bad so sad, they refused to offer child swap or single rider, it was so strange but the staff is clearly miserable. Lines too long, it doesn’t matter what you need, food, shopping, desserts, restrooms, 30-40 mins line. There was a line to use the baby center 😒. Extremely disorganized extremely disappointed. We went day 1 hopper, left early HERE IS THE KICKER!!! Prices keep going up and they no longer do fireworks Mon-Thursday. We got none, our second day we showed up at noon, we were suffocating with the lines and crowds and ran out of there at 5 pm, it felt so good and liberating to leave, even seeing our money go down the drain. You can’t pay us to go back. Never againOriginal: We love this place!!! It is definitely the happiest place with the friendliest staff, best service and always stands above all other theme parks for that. We love it we miss it all the time.",2023-01-03
"Honestly, this place is the biggest scam. Do not buy the pass it is a waste of money because most days are blocked out anyways. Even when the days are not blocked out the park is always over-crowded and everything is overpriced. I made a reservation and it did not process and I was not notified of this. I found out my reservation didn't go through by checking randomly and when I tried to re-reserve the date it was blocked out. I called customer service and was on hold hearing nothing but Disney advertisements for 30+ minutes. I asked if there was anything they could do to help me because I had reserved the date to go with a group of my friends. They offered zero help and basically just said oh well. I then politely asked to speak to a supervisor and they put me on hold for 15+ minutes. They answered in a rude tone to say, ""Is this your mom's account?"" I said yes. They rudely said, ""We cannot speak with you because you are a minor."" I told them I am not a minor. Then they again rudely said, ""You just verified your age, have a magical night."" Then hung up the phone. I'd like to mention I was being extremely polite the entire phone call because I know that people won't help you if you start talking rude and entitled. I cannot believe the customer service honestly. I've never written a review before this is my first and take my advice...DO NOT BUY A PASS!",2023-01-07
"We had a magical day October 12.  The cast members were so kind and helpful. We parked in the Toy Story Parking Lot and rode the Disney bus to the park. You have to fold strollers before getting on the bus. Arrive before park opening because they let people go through security/scan in turnstiles, then they hold people in front of the castle until rope drop to enter the various lands. There were quite a few rides closed for refurbishment so that is my reasoning for 4 instead of 5 stars (Space Mountain, Splash Mountain soon to be Tiana’s Bayou, Mark Twain Riverboat, Centoonial Park). I loved the  temporary re-theming of Haunted Mansion to The Nightmare Before Christmas. The cheesy garlic pretzel bread at Eidelweiss was one of our favorite snacks and the lemon curd beignets at Tianna’s were so good. The character greetings we had were with Mickey, Eeyore, Pooh, and Tigger. The characters and their cast members made those moments very special. We had lunch at Tianna’s Palace, and Tianna walked around the tables greeting guests which was a neat surprise. The Magic Happens Parade captivated my grandson, my daughter, and me. I highly recommend riding Big Thunder Mountain at night because the dimmer lighting provides more surprises with the drops/dips",2023-01-03
"""I visited Disney World previously and left with the feeling that it truly lived up to its slogan as the happiest place on earth. Disneyland, on the other hand, provided a different experience. During our visit in the last week of September, in the middle of the week, it was excessively crowded.Getting food proved challenging, as we were either told to use mobile order or faced a wait of at least 30 minutes. This setup isn't inclusive for everyone. Having additional kiosks might alleviate this issue. The restroom facilities I visited weren't designed with kids in mind. The toilet cover dispensers were installed for adult, about 5 feet high above the toilet, and the toilets themselves were too tall for children under 8 years old. The wait times for each ride were astonishingly long, and people were packed closely together.The mobile app wasn't particularly user-friendly and drained my phone battery quickly. It also operated sluggishly and caused my phone to freeze twice. There were no charging stations in the park, so we had to return to the hotel to recharge our phones.This experience left me exhausted and wonder how others could enjoy it. """,2023-01-05
"Decepcionante experiencia….He estado en muchos parques Disney y este ha sido con creces el peor junto con el universal studios de Hollywood. Fuimos un martes y largas colas (para todo), sin zonas de sombra, parkings de carritos de niños obstaculizando todos los pasos… En mi opinión es un parque que no está habilitado para el volumen de gente que recibe a diario. Recomiendo mucho más ir al de Orlando o Paris que a este. Recomiendo mucho más de hecho ir a Port Aventura o Warner Bross. MUY DECEPCIONANTE.Es la mitad de pequeño que Disneyland Paris pero acoge al doble de gente. No solo es que las colas para TODAS las atracciones Sean de más de 1 hora, es que no puedes andar ni disfrutar de las decoraciones porque literalmente la cantidad de gente que hay las tapa!!!!Es EXTREMADAMENTE CARO, para mi los parques temáticos han marcado momentos importantes en mi vida y, aunque caro, no podía dejar de venir a este. A las 12 de la mañana ya quería marcharme a casa totalmente decepcionada y asqueada.No vengas solo por ser el primero que se hizo, ni por ser California… habiendo estado en Disneyland Paris, ahorraos el mal sabor de boca que deja este.",2023-01-05
"When they say that Disneyland is the ""Happiest place on Earth"", they mean it. Disneyland is one of my favorite places in the entire world and I will never forget how much I love to be there. There is so much stuff at Disneyland that will please anyone even if you dont like Disney that much. If you love horror, vampires and monsters, go to The Haunted Mansion, if you love sci Fi and dream of what the future is like go to tommorow land, if you love star wars, go to Galaxy's Edge which takes you (not literally) to the galaxy far far away we all know and love. And if you love Disney I shouldn't even explain why you should go. It is every Disney, and Star Wars fan's paradise and everyone should visit it at least some point in there life. I just went a few weeks ago at the time of writing this and it was the most fun I've had since I've been to Wrestle Mania Hollywood in April of 2023. The food and merch is really good as well. It really is the Happiest place on Earth (well at least in my opinion). Also I love the smell of the water on Pirates of the Caribbean. If they made a deodorant or a candle that smelled like it, I would buy it ASAP.",2023-01-05
"I gave this place 5 stars back in 2018, but this time I’m giving it 1 and here is why. Dear disneyland park management why are taking so many people per day? Like seriously we went this monday 9/18/23 and it was super super super crowded! You need to limit your visitors per day to an acceptable number. Each ride would have a minimum of 45 minutes wait. You know kids have no patience they get bored after few minutes why do you torture us as parents. I mean you make lots of money anyway you dont need to have million ppl come everyday!!!!!!! It was a horrible experience and needless to say the costumer service was awful. I have some disabilities so i has to rent the electrical scooter and lots of the rides were not disable-friendly. Like you have to go and register and they would give you an estimate time to when your turn is. Also, they got so aggressive when the pride started they were sending us in a wrong direction and my scooter got stuck and my husband was far away I almost cried i was desperately in need of help. Seriously when I remember this i want to cry!I would really appreciate if my voice will be heard!",2023-01-07
"Extremely disappointed in Disneyland.  Our family spent thousands of dollars to get here. Came from several different states to enjoy the Halloween time. 2 weeks before Halloween they stop all parades. We're here on the actual day of the 100th anniversary, they've takin down all decorations. They have 100th anniversary items everywhere but act like it's no big deal. We have brought our kids up on Disney, they are know adults with with families and we all still plan a visit to a Disney every other year. On this visit we were on a ride, someone threw-up and unfortunately we were hit with spray. Not pleasant! We tried to wave down a cast member but all they were concerned about was who had actually thrown-up. When we were finished with the ride we told the team they may want to wipe down our cart as well. The other complaint I have - my kids and grandkids come to see the characters however they have become very hard to find which is upsetting in another nature all together. We're OUT OF COVID. So return the parks to the way they were. This family of 12 will find it hard to return to this form of Disney.",2023-01-01
"Was super excited to travel from PA to CA with my family to experience Disneyland for the first time. We went to California adventure Saturday 9/23 and Disneyland Monday 9/25. We figured peak season would be slowing down since kids are just returning to school and one of the days we were visiting was a weekday, boy were we wrong. There were so many people in Disneyland on 9/25 I could barely get through the crowds with my sons stroller. People walking, stopping, cutting you off in every direction. We were at the park around 8:20 very shortly after they opened and was baffled by all of the people that were there. I was also confused why I had to make reservations at the park, which I presumed meant there would be limited tickets available to control crowd size. My family and I honestly just gave up and left because of how insane and  stressful the park was on a MONDAY. I don’t understand how you can call this  the “happiest place on earth” when wait lines for rides AND FOOD are over an hour. We were extremely disappointed and I honestly wished I could've gotten a refund. Ridiculous.",2023-01-07
"My experience with Aryana on September 25th at around 12:45 pm at Disneyland was beyond disappointing. She was the person in charge of the Indiana Jones line, and her behavior was nothing short of rude and unprofessional.Aryana not only displayed a complete lack of courtesy but also went to the extent of rudely instructing us to call the manager and wait, all while a stream of people passed by us. This humiliating experience made us feel like we were being treated as children who had misbehaved.Waiting on the side for a manager for 15 minutes in such a busy and exciting place like Disneyland was frustrating and embarrassing. Aryana's behavior not only ruined our experience of the park that day but also left us with a sour impression of Disneyland's customer service.Aryana's conduct was unacceptable, and it's disheartening to encounter such behavior in a place that is supposed to be all about creating magical and memorable moments for its visitors. Disneyland should strive for excellence in customer service, and experiences like this one with Aryana fall far short of that standard.",2023-01-07
"Fantastic place, first time visiting in over a decade. I highly recommend buying tickets, making the reservation, and buying the parking all in advance. If you're just going to Disneyland Park, I recommend parking in the Toy Story parking area. They have a shuttle that comes very often, and it saves you the walking (you'll be walking a lot in the park anyways). Even on a Tuesday the rides were packed and the walkways were FILLED with people. The new Star Wars attraction and the design around that area is absolutely beautiful. It looks like you're actually walking in Star Wars. They even have a life-size millennium falcon next to one of the rides. You should download the app so you can see the wait times by ride, as they update pretty often. Mid September is usually one of the least busy times of the year, and Tuesday is the least busy day of the week. Clearly it was still very packed, so be prepared. I would also recommend packing snacks and food because the food is very expensive inside. It also saves you some time ordering and waiting for food in the long lines.",2023-01-06
Was waiting for my gf while she shopped for trading pins and was told I have to move while standing in front of the store. After telling the employee I was waiting to for my gf and my feet were tired he could care less. He wouldn’t leave me alone and became aggressive. After telling them I feel like I’m being harassed and if I could please be left alone he made the situation worse.  I simply told him that I have been asked by seven different people to move from one end of Main Street to the other. Instead of just leaving me alone he calls security all because I’m standing in front of a store waiting for my gf. As I walk inside the store he follows me and tells me I have to be 5 feet in the shop and I asked again if I could be left alone. He stands in front of the door and calls security when I have done what he has asked! All this started because I was tired and wanted to rest my feet as she shopped for pins. And I never mentioned that there was another party in front of the shop and they were never told anything.,2023-01-05
"Disneyland “the most expensive” place on earth! They don’t care about making it magical anymore; it’s all about money!! If you don’t want to spend your whole day waiting in line better plan to pay extra for each ride with the genie pass too.I was a magic key holder and needed to get a pass for my toddler since they weren’t available for purchase at the time. They told me I needed “special approval” to get my toddler a magic key too. Well come to find out once it was too late, that special approval is 60 days after they turn 3, and in person at the Disney ticket counter. They were unwilling to work with me and allow my kid to get a magic key too.This last trip I was there I had a dining reservation at cafe orleans! I was so excited, my husband and I decided to share the “$50” meal. It came with a monte cristo, appetizer, and a dessert. The waiter was so rude and rolled his eyes when we said we were sharing. Such rude service for an expensive meal!",2023-01-03
"Do not bother with this place! It will take you at least 35-40 minutes just to get through security as they pick through every little insignificant thing in you bag one by one. There's no magic here, only greed and people who don't know how to direct you. Expect long wait times on most rides and being herded like cattle by the cast members, you can't stand anywhere apparently. There is overcrowding and people will push you and bump into you and don't care. And if you try and eat dinner after 8pm, goodluck because most the places are closed or only open for mobile ordering. And lastly don't expect to be leaving with any souvenirs, as all your money was spent on tickets already and most of the stuff is way overpriced. I mean $50.00 for mouse ears and $18.00 for a small bag of toffee is just ridiculous. Even if you spend the whole day here from 8am-12am you'll still only get on about a quarter of the rides, that is unless your willing to pay extra.",2023-01-07
"Very much crowded, 1 of the ride we have to queue up for 3hours rest of the rides average wait time 1hour plus.It’s worth but if you are ready for wait and stand up in lines to get your turn.If you coming with kids make sure your kids should understand the crowd rush etc & kids must be very much patience holders and kids must be at-least eight years plus to enjoy most of the venue.Good thing was air-cons & fans were installed almost everywhere so still one can wait without exhausting etc.Food is expensive inside hut we still managed to buy as we were 6 of us to have the lunch cost us $179, good thing is you can take your snacks and beverages including water etc from outside when you enter.Restrooms are almost at everywhere & very cleaned inside out.Drinking Water taps are everywhere to get you go or refill your water bottles etc.One day is not enough to enjoy Disney so when you buying tickets try to buy for 3 day pass.Honest review by me 👍",2023-01-05
"It makes no sense at all to bring your kids to this place. Sadly, and honestly, your 8 and 10 yo kids will struggle at the linesPros: easy to park and shuttle, plenty of attractions.Cons: (1) Monsters Inc broke down three times, cars broke down twice, (2) the genie pass never worked (now there’s a new thing called lightning line which you have to pay for in ever ride at a cost of 18 USD each time), (3) food is basically a 20 USD/person thing with no way around it, for which you wait between 30 to 55 minutes, depending on where you go to, (4) nobody ever knows why the rides are not working, or for how long they will be down, (5) the shortest wait time we had (we used DAS, genie pass, etc) was 67 minutes.If you have kids with disabilities, you definitely need to look for a disability pass, or at least the genie, to make it easier for you while on the  waiting line. Check guest services at the entrance, after they checked you in.",2023-01-03
"Today was the worst Disneyland experience. I'll start by saying , how do you only have 4 breakfast spots open in the whole park on a Sunday? Sundays were made for brunch! Yes, we came for the rides and experience but I'll get to that next. You can't enjoy yourself when you're starving and it's an hour wait to get food. The mobile order was a joke. You could order and pick up in 2 hours. One of the breakfast spots was only sit downbut they were at capacity and the cart selling breakfast burrito sold out by 9am. The Starbucks had at least 100 people in line. It was like a ride line. Pass. What is the point of having to make reservations when they don't limit the crowds? It was a crowded mess. Many of the ride wait times were false. Like the Alice in Wonderland said 25 minutes and we were in line for 40. That happened to us several times today. Overall I'm just unhappy with the experience we had for the amount of money spent.",2023-01-07
"I went to Disneyland Park in 2016 with my Nana, Papa, and brother. I had an all-around good experience. We were not able to go on any of the rides due to a weird new system, I think. I don't know much about why we couldn't. So most of my time there was spent walking around and enjoying everything other than the rides. I remember seeing a lot of the character mascots, like Goofy, Donald, and a few others that I don't remember. From what I remember from when I was there, 7-8-year-old me loved seeing them. We were there for maybe 1-2 weeks, and every morning we would get breakfast, and I would get the scrambled eggs and the things I would do to eat those eggs again. I loved the eggs so much that it has become a joke among me and my family about how I loved the eggs so much. All around, it was a good place to go with family; everyone was nice, and it was an enjoyable experience from just hanging out with family.",2023-01-02
"Disneyland has really lost its magic over the last few years especially. The lightning lane lines sometimes take up to 30 minutes because they oversell them. And we purchased an item that is clearly defective (we replaced it three times and the item still broke), and when we finally decided to return the item, since it was literally the next day after we purchased it, they refused to do anything about it. They wouldn't even give us another replacement after the last one broke. We went to the town hall to see if they would do anything, and all they did was give us the customer service number to call. I haven't done that yet, but I'm not hopeful given that Disney is obviously only concerned about profits and not about the guest experience. PS do NOT purchase the space mountain metal water bottle that is being sold at galactic grill. They seriously need to recall this product due to it's defectiveness.",2023-01-07
"I’d have to say I’m very disappointed. Disneyland definitely needs to make some changes before I bring my family back. We visited on the weekend and weekday. Disney is not what it once was, and has lost its magic touch. None of the employees smiled. Lines were ridiculous (over hour waits) even with the ‘Genie’ which is just silly & a waste of money. My daughter did Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique- her hair was very sloppy done, nails were just barely painted, makeup was not great. This was over $200. Will not be doing that again. Most rides were constantly breaking down which changes your ‘genie’ lighting lane so after waiting for hours they would just cancel on you. Characters were hardly out, and when they were they were on the ‘move’ so couldn’t take photos or interact with the children. We travelled from Vancouver island, I will definitely be spending my money to go elsewhere next year.",2023-01-05
"I don’t often take time to write reviews but I want to give a HUGE shoutout to Marlee. She is an employee that was working at Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance. She was genuine, took time to explain the situation as I approached the ride when it was shut down, and honestly made our, what felt like 10 mile walk over to the ride worth it! She told us she is approaching 10 years at Disneyland and I’ll tell you what, if the day comes that she leaves, Disney will lose an absolute gem of an employee. She treated my family members with respect and treated us warmly as we were saddened to see the ride was shut down.That being said, we did end up riding the ride and was blown away at how impressive and thrilling it was. Talk about a one of a kind experience! 12/10 would recommend! Oh, and if you get the chance to talk to Marlee, she will brighten your whole trip with her friendly smile!",2023-01-07
Disneyland truly have been such a disappointment. I came here back in March 2022 and did not have the issues I have faced Today September 2023. I have been here three days and have been in 6 lines that have gone out of service after waiting over 30-40 minutes to get on the ride. Paying hundreds of dollars for a family of three including $90 of parking for three days not to mention $75 for genie passes to then not to be able to get on rides is insane. Disneyland has truly lost its magic in my mind and it’s not as it use to be.The prices in food have been astronomical and outrageous for cold food. I don’t think I will ever want to do Disneyland again. It’s a huge financial investment to simply be disappointed and being smacked with constantly disappointment.**picture of hundreds of people waiting after already waiting 30 minutes to get on. Because yet again another ride down**,2023-01-06
I was at Disneyland Monday October 2nd.It was an awful experience. Characters made my 4 year old niece cry when they looked at her put there hand up and ignored her.You try to ask for help from an employee and they give you attitude.  And won't help you.They treated my dad who was disabled and handicap like he was in the way.And don't forget the popcorn stand outside the pirates of the Caribbean ride that had to guys working it at.I walk up to the stand I as for cotton candy and they just stare at me with no response. I ask 3 more times. Both just stare no response. I say do you speak words. And I look at my sister and niece who just want cotton candy. And still not response to me. They look over at her and laugh! How dare you allow people to be treated like that!Oh and you might as well skip thebautograph book for the kids. Half of them refused to sign anyways,2023-01-04
"Disneyland Park CASin duda, visitar disney es el sueño de todo niño y/o niño interior. Toda la visita a las instalaciones es totalmente mágica. Es una experiencia de atención, servicio, coordinación, compromiso, entrega, entre otras cosas.Describirlo es complicado, se debe vivir para entender. Sin duda  un lugar que debes conocer.Tips si vas de méxico:- Ir entre semana y temprano para aprovechar las atracciones que te ofrecen en tu boleto.- Descarga la app de disney, para que conozcas las programaciones del día, atracciones cerradas, el mapa, y el tiempo de espera.- Si tienes posibilidad, compra el geniepass que puedes obtener en la app de Disney. Con es te ahorraras muchisimo tiempo en la entrada a cada atracción.- Los consumos dentro de disney están algo elevados, así que si buscas ir pero ahorrar un poco, puedes ingresar alimentos básicos sin problema.",2023-01-07
"A lot of our friends are in the ""Disney is money grab, long lines, short rides"" camp so we came with a fairly low expectations (this was our 1st trip). First, the money part is true. The thing is horrendously, stupefyingly expensive. And yes during the school off days the lines can get  longHowever, if you have the money (and kids) you should do it. We very much enjoyed it. You do want Genie+ otherwise 60+ minutes lines for popular rides. You can look at the Disney app tip board and pick rides with shorter lines like we did. Our line tolerance was probably ~20 minutes and  we had 3 fun filled days there, met a few characters, had decent meals, and very much enjoyed ourselves.One more tip: don't promise kids ""you will definitely meet Mickey or Elsa or whoever."" Just promise fun and surprises. Better outcomes for you this way!",2023-01-04
"Even weekdays are no longer a safe option.Proceed with caution, it's not the same. Everything is done through the app and it's very inaccurate. Your ticket does NOT equal entry if it's not activated. They are overselling the tickets, and it's impossible to walk around the park with the huge crowds. There are some very kind cast members, but I happened to come across one that was very rude. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon. Very frustrating experience from what it was when I was a child. I would not take elderly or children into the park anymore because people are literally pushing and shoving people. Almost makes me want to stop supporting the company entirely.The worst part is you have to struggle to find food and find a place to sit... even with reservations. It's ridiculous.",2023-01-07
"I had a nasty experience in City Hall on September 4th; a middle-aged Caucasian female cast member didn’t believe I was epileptic — so in her eyes I didn’t qualify for DAS.Disney Resorts changed their rules for DAS in 2021; I was granted DAS @ WDW in 2022, & this was my experience at my home park in 2023. Brutally harrowing & uncomfortable. I wasn’t inpatient at the Mayo Clinic for this birdbrain to decide I was lying.If my sister hadn’t met with a friend whose dad advocated for me @ another customer service CM stand about an hour later, I was ready to turn heel to request a refund — turns out older adults respect their peers more so than two girls in their mid-twenties. She was the first stranger to ever disbelieve my being disabled. WTA*?",2023-01-02
"I went to both parks Friday and Saturday. You can't beat the atmosphere. Disney keeps both Disney and California adventures spotless. The experience is great. Of course there are crowds but that's because it's so awesome. My only complaint is that their rides in both parks are kind of like old studebakers. Unreliable. Rides were down for days, others broke down when waiting in line. It made the park seem more crowded because of the rides that can't be used so everyone crowds the rides that are working. In 2 days we experienced breakages in Grizzly River Run, Indiana Jones, Star Tours, Goofy's sky school, Guardians of the galaxy, Webslingers, Radiator Springs racers, Incredicoaster, and probably others I can't think of",2023-01-05
"I have always loved visiting this park, though I still want to go to Disney World someday. This place has always been so much fun. I will have to say that my favorite ride would have to be the Peter Pan ride. Though some of the new rides are absolutely amazing and so much fun! The food is also better than anything I have ever had in my life. The whole experience is like a dream everytime you visit and even as a Disney Adult, when you visit, you feel like a kid again. I especially love visiting for holidays like Halloween or Christmas cause it makes it so much more special. Last time I visited, it was for Christmas and the first time I went for Christmas. The atmosphere was better than I could have ever imagined.",2023-01-05
"We have been living around Disneyland for more than ten years. Their firework every day are so annoying. Also, 30 minutes long. So loud is not suitable for children. Why don't they do it occasionally? Why don't they care about children's health? It's sound pollution. I take my children to bed at 8:30 pm when they almost fall asleep after a firework starts. I don't understand. Why doesn't Disneyland think about the children's health? Also, parents like me who work at night, students, and full-time mothers, don't we have the right to sleep without having a loud noise? I beg your consideration on behalf of all children who are the country's future. Please let them live healthy lives 🙏🙏🙏",2023-01-05
This was my first time coming to Disneyland and Disneyland California Adventures  parks. Both parks were extremely busy for a weekday during the school year. The admission ticket into the park was $169. Due to this we planned on staying all day at the park until close. And I can tell you it was extremely busy from the start of our park experience to when the park closed.  All the lines were very busy and we got the lighting pass. Which works with reservations. I will say towards the end of the night we were able to ride more rides which was fun. I would recommend going to Disneyland for multiple days so you can experience everything. Plan to have this be a very expensive trip.,2023-01-05
"It's too packed. The amount of people on top of one another is not very comfortable. I would suggest they have some weeks that are more exclusive because there was a lot of rift raft or to be honest low quality people. Was trying to enjoy dinner and a drunk man was just cussing very loud with no regard for others. Have any of these rides been upgraded?? Seems like the same ol rides as when I was a child. On the bright the food at the Hungry Bear restaurant was good. Highly suggest the blueberry lemonade. Get preferred parking, it definitely helps. I struggle to see myself coming here again just for the simple fact that it is very crowded with people with no manners.",2023-01-06
"Our family of four visited Disneyland on a Tuesday outside of school holiday times and it was absolutely packed. Everything is extremely crowded and unpleasant. The wait times are completely inaccurate - we were told there would be a 15 minute wait to meet 3 “surprise” princesses, we wait an over a hour and the princesses were random ones we have never heard of. They are not the main ones your children want to meet. The “cast members” (staff) are so rude and spent the entire time telling people off for minor things. Thoroughly unpleasant and overpriced in every regard. Such a shame!!!",2023-01-08
"The worst experience I have ever had at an amusement park. We paid for genie passes and still waited 3 hours in line because a ride broke down 4-5 times, AND they want you to pay extra for their most popular ride on top of the genie pass. We have been here for 4 hours and still haven’t made it onto a ride yet. PLUS, we have to leave early because of Oogie Boogie Bash!! We came all the way from Canada for this “once in a lifetime” trip and were severely disappointed. We had a group of 11 people so this was not a cheap trip for us either. Do better Disney!",2023-01-05
"Wir haben uns auf DisneyLand mega gefreut. Ein Kindheitstraum hätte in Erfüllung gehen sollen. Leider war der Tag geprägt von Anstehen, Fehlangabe über Wartezeiten, geschlossenen Bahnen und unmotiviertem sowie unfreundlichem Personal. Unglaublich- im Gegensatz zu UniversalStudios und Legoland in Kalifornien kann man diesen Park nicht empfehlen. Der Stau und das Gedränge ist künstlich erstellt um den normalen Bürgern den Tag zu vermiesen. Wenn man mal auf einer Bahn ist, sind sie richtig toll.

"Do I think it’s worth going to? Yes if you’ve never been. But in my honest opinion, I would not go back even though we absolutely love our vacation in California and think it’s beautiful out here. It really doesn’t  compare to Disney World or the parks like Universal, etc. and all honestly I think Dollywood had more to do there including a waterpark, but of course at Disneyland you’re here for the nostalgia. Again, if you have not been here, it’s worth coming to once. I think kids will enjoy it, but I do not think it compares remotely to Disney World",2023-01-06
"We visited back in March of 2022 and we had a beautiful experience even with two of our five being under the weather which only means a mandatory do-over. Loving it!It was our first time visiting Disneyland not just as a family but individually as well. So we shall always cherish the memories as we plan to make even more at this magical place.When we see the smiles on our children's faces, it automatically generates one on ours. Summer of 2024 will more than likely be our next visit to this happy place. Shout out to Mickey Mouse and the whole crew.",2023-01-05
"Disney is obviously recovering from Covid, prices are ridiculous and the lighting pass is a scam. Most rides do not have lightning lanes, or if they do and you book a pass, the rides close/shut down and you are told too bad, so sad. Don’t waste your money on the lightning lane passes.Also, be prepared to wait in hour long lines to have the rides shut down before you get on. We came to the park and did not get on a single ride and the characters were too busy to take pictures. Most expensive waste of time. Disney should be investigated for fraud.",2023-01-05

I have pondered on writing this review for a few days sense we got home. I am so sad to say this last Disneyland experience for us was not a good one… We could not believe how many rude employee we came into contact with.. None of the employees smiled at anytime!! No one was willing to help answer any questions we had about anythuThey only referred us back to the app for answers.. Amy husband said multiple times I thought this was the happiest place on earth and not one employee here looks like they want to be here… it was so sad!!,2023-01-06
"Was fun to go back as an adult and bring our kids, but was ridiculously expensive and extremely busy.  If early October was slow time i would hate to see mid summer,  most rides were over an hour wait and shoulder to shoulder people everywhere.  If Disney capacity is 90,000 people a day it felt double that.   Stroller mayhem out of control,  adult and kids.   Would never go back, there is nothing magical about price gouging. We all enjoyed Universal Studios much more.  Oh and purchase disney gifts off grounds to save half price.",2023-01-01
"I don't usually do reviews because to each their own however, I went to DL in the summer of 2022 and it was the worst ! Apparently DL could care less how many people they let into the park. As long as they make money. My daughter and I were there for 8 hours, waited forever in line for two rides !? Waiting in the blazing sun...rides down or broken, shift changes, 300 or more people in front of us at any attraction, antsee kids, crying babies, clueless parents, elderly...Really ?

"We just spent 3 days in Disneyland & 2 in California Word. 3 best tips for overseas travelers attending.1st, if you can afford it get a front of the line pass.2nd, While you are there just forget about the price because it will wreck you trip. It is crazy expensive. Go to target or Walmart for the same Disneyland shirts & 80% cheaper.3rd, just give into it & enjoy.Take your own water & food to save some money but either way enjoy it first, worry about the price when you get home.Great fun with your family, we loved it.",2023-01-05
Visited with friends who love Disney. My boyfriend and I are not that into Disney but had never been so we went with our friends. You do not need to be that into Disney to enjoy Disneyland. It's honestly amazing! The service is phenomenal and it's truly an immersive experience. The food is fantastic and the rides are a lot of fun.

"Get ready to feel a wide variety of emotions from joy to exhaustion. But it’ll always end up being a experience to remember.As always with full day excursions, bring a backpack for necessities, such as water bottle(s), sunscreen, and maybe snacks. Especially for the full experience, from early entry to close (7:30-midnight). (Early entry tip, the entrances for both parks are located in different areas in Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel. The line typically starts forming before 7am).",2023-01-01
"Not sure what has happened to this place, but it has gone downhill a lot since pre-covid. Every ride experienced technical difficulties, many experienced enough downtime to prevent lightning lane use with genie+. Had at least one breakdown while in line and got stuck on Pirates in a long boat chain twice, both for 10+ minutes. The whole experience left me wondering if the rides were safe at all. Some magic has been lost. I hope management does what's necessary to fix the rides.",2023-01-07
"Realmente una experiencia muy mala. A parte de lo caro que llega a ser todo, son los aforos que no se respetan, larguísimas colas, mucha más gente que la que admite el parque, en un dia laborable, no quiero imaginarme un festivo.

Ended up only riding a few rides after spending almost 3 hours in line to enjoy one ride. And then you have to pay extra to use the lightning lane that you purchased before? Couldn't buy any likeable souvenirs because the prices are outrageous. Ended up being one of the most depressing places on earth, definitely not a happy place.",2023-01-07

My experience was so terrible I have crippling anxiety and I also have three beautiful children I went down to city hall and asked them if they can help accommodate me in the lines I can’t be around a lot of people because of my anxiety and depression but I tried to make it a good day for my kids the people down at city hall Disney land were very rude and ruined my experience and my kids it’s supposed to be the happiest place on earth and it wasn’t for us,2023-01-05
"The Lightening Lane pass is not a good value, and in my opinion a ripoff. For the popular attractions the lightning lane is not even available , or always sold out. Just too many limitations. Some times I wonder if Disney purposely allows the wait times to be so long to get visitors to buy multiple day passes, ripoff lightening lane, or have to come back again. Seems like after all these years they could have figured out how to move lines faster.",2023-01-02
"First time visiting Disneyland, and we had a blast. We visited both Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park. I do recommend  ordering the tickets in advance and also getting the Genie+ Lightning Lane Passes. Having that really helped us with not having to wait in long lines, and once you download the app it will provide you with locations and waiting times. It was really a great experience, and that map on the app is. life saver.",2023-01-04
Einfach das Original. Gerade zur Halloweenzeit tolle Atmosphäre viel besser als Orlando. Preisniveau mittlerweile nicht ohne.Geniepass ich eine gute Erweiterung vor allem wenn man PhotoPass auch nutzt. Für Attraktionen nur bedingt tauglich da nur Buchungen alle 2 Stunden möglich sind und dazu lange Zeiten bis zur eigentlichen Buchungszeit.Trotz allem für Disneyfans egal ob alt oder jung trotz der mittlerweile hohen Preise ein absolutes Muss.,2023-01-07
"When we went last week it was awful! Security was rude before we even got into the park. He talked so low and got mad my daughter didn’t hear his instructions. Dude, you’re working at Disneyland not the airport.Inside the park people were cutting the lines and it wasn't just one person but 5+ people. Cast mates were rude when we asked how lightning lane worked and it made it seem like we were bothering them. Overall terrible experience.",2023-01-06
What a pathetic experience in comparison to Universal Studios. No parent swap or parent waiting rooms in the rides. Express lane also non existent. Genie plus is just robbery as is the pricing for everything inside Disney and around it. Staff are so much worse. No customer service. Too many people enter the park to make it enjoyable for anyone. Waste of time effort and money for a family of 6. Don’t recommend this place to anyone!!,2023-01-05
Disneyland Anaheim needs to shut down permanently for good because they are increasing money making it expensive and Disneyland workers are very rude with people so it’s better Disneyland workers in Anaheim are fired permanently for not doing their job right and for behaving rudely with people at Disneyland Anaheim. So I recommend everyone visit Disneyland in Paris because they do their job right and they are polite with people.,2023-01-06
"Really lives up to its name! The lands are all super great quality making you feel like your in fiction and the ride theming is greater than no other. Since I had a disability I got to go in the fast pass line for free the service was very friendly and I overall had a great time one complaint though is that the rides keep closing, like splash mountain and apparently more to come?! Disney stop removing the main attractions XD",2023-01-06
"We have usually taken the family every 2-3 years. Prices have gone up considerably and the new Lightning pass system is terrible. Not only does it cost more, but you can only use the pass once per ride, per day. And rides like Rise of the Resistance require an additional $26 per rider for a Lightning Pass.Bottom line is, compared to a few years ago, you are going to pay a lot more for less. I don't recommend going anymore.",2023-01-04
平日にチケットを事前に買って遊びに行きました。アメリカだけあって駐車場も広く、パークまで無料のシャトルバスが出ています。アメリカのディズニーのスマホアプリを事前にダウンロードしておけば、車をどこに停めたかわかるようになっているので便利です。日本のディズニーランドにはない、スターウォーズやファインディング・ニモのアトラクションで遊んできました。さすが本場だけあって、セットも作り込みが凄いし、どちらも映画の世界に入り込んだような感覚を覚えました。今回は行けなかったのですが、カリフォルニアアドベンチャーという別のパークもあるので、今度はそちらにも行きたいです。日本と同じく、アプリでアトラクションの待ち時間などが見えますが、これがあまり当てにならず、実際と結構異なっていたのがアメリカらしいところでした。園内にスタバがあって、限定タンブラーがあったので記念に買うのも良さそうです。ディズニー100周年という記念の年に行くことができてラッキーでした。,2023-01-01
"Buy your tickets in advance.  They still have covid-era limited reservations in place. The lines become ridiculously long after 11am when the park-hopper people are allowed to jump from California adventure to Disneyland park.If you want to see the parade or fireworks up close arrive to the area an hour in advance.If you want the memorabilia popcorn buckets, buy them as soon as you enter the park, they sell out often.",2023-01-06
スターウォーズファンは死ぬまでに絶対行かなくては行けない場所だと思いました。YouTube等で見るのとは、全然違います！ミレニアムファルコンを見た時には、涙が溢れ、アトラクでファーストオーダーに捕まった際には、鳥肌が！！！エリアもアトラクも、キャラグリも、本当に素晴らしかったです！街をレイやチューバッカが歩いている世界観が本当にヤバいです！！東京に比べてワールドバザールがコンパクトで、機動性の高いパークです！(東京は、広すぎて…ロッカーにすら行く気にならないのは、私だけでしょうか？😅💦)本場のカリブの海賊は、東京より沢山落ちます！楽しいです！アトラクは、アドベンチャーと同様、どれもすごく楽しくて、一つ一つが長いので、見応えがあり、並んだかいがあったな！と思えます😊東京もこうすれば良いのに…  ︎と思う点が多すぎて、東京パークには、もう行けないかもしれないと思うほどでした！しいていえば、食べ物は東京の方が美味しいです😁,2023-01-06
"*SOCAL RESIDENT*There once was a time, what seems like long ago, when Disneyland was the happiest place on earth. Passes were cheap. There were slow days & seasons. You could drive to the park anytime your heart desired without a second thought. Now, much like the entertainment Disney pushes in other mediums, Disneyland is expensive, thoughtless, and run-of-the-mill. Maybe the magic has finally run out.",2023-01-01
"A must-visit if you like Disney. We visited Disneyland for 2 days and we have easily done all rides we wanted to do. The park is very clean, atmosphere very good and staff very helpful and friendly.It is a crowded park, so the genie+ is absolutely worth it (it enables you to use 'Lightning Lines' for many attractions). We went off-season on a workday and the popular rides were still 40-60 minutes lines.",2023-01-05
"We went to Disney Adventure Park specifically for Carsland. Wait time said 65 minutes, but at 2 hrs of wait time the ride went down due to technical difficulties. We were still probably another 45 minutes away from riding either way. The “convenient” wait time was inaccurate across the board for all rides. To me, Disney Orland did a better job. I wouldn’t return to Disneyland. I was disappointed.",2023-01-05
At Disneyland right now and it’s pretty pathetic that they tell you when you get in line your wait time is “50 minutes” but then it just so happens to change to “85 minutes” because of the lighting lane. I’m so over how the “happiest place on earth” has just turned into a money hungry company. Maybe you wouldn’t have to do this if your movies were better. Glad you went back to your old CEO.,2023-01-05
"It's a little sad because you pay an amount of money to get into the disneyland world and unless you get the lightning line the waiting time becomes extremely big....in many rides they let 4 people from the regular line,more or less,and 15 from the lightning queues...I understand that the goal is the money and how to make the most out of it....but in my opinion things could be better....",2023-01-02
"פארק שעשועים גדול, מיועד בעיקר לילדים קטנים.אין כמעט רכבות רציניות והרוב זה רכבות של חוויה בין הדמויות של דיסני.יש הרבה מסעדות ודוכני מזון כל כמה מטרים והאוכל מגיע טובמומלץ להשתמש באפליקציה של הפארק כדי לעקוב אחרי התורים באטרקציות השונות ולנווט בפארק בין המתקנים. באפליקציה אפשר גם להזמין אוכל מחלק מהמסעדות ובכך לראות את התפריט בצורה יותר נוחה ולחסוך את העמידה בתורים שיכולים להיות ארוכים.",2023-01-07
"Worst place ever, the food and souvenirs are too much money and the staff are rude. I had to wait a whole hour in almost every line for the rides, and they weren't even fun! Since Disneyland already takes everyone's money from the tickets to get in, they should lower the prices of the souvenirs 🤦 they were so expensive for something that costs $2 to make. I DO NOT recommend going.",2023-01-07
Chimichangas were hard as rock and Churros were way too crunchy and no soft center. I have been to Disneyland about a 100 times and these food items are not the same as they used to be from when I last visited back before the pandemic shut down. Please bring back the old way you used to make your churros and chimichangas. I don’t care if I have to pay .75 cents more.,2023-01-05
"Not happy with our experience. Spent $ on the Genie + pass for three people and only got to use it on two rides. Was cut in stand by lanes. They did end up refunding us with a Disney gift card, but I had to reach out to a completely separate department than the ones listed on the site and it took weeks to gear back maybe even over a month do to how busy they are.",2023-01-07
"A great time! It always manages to make you feel like a kid again. The music stays with you but in a very subtle way. If you plan it right you don't have to spend a ton of money once you get in the gate to still have fun. I wish Genie+ was set up a little better, I think Fastpass we were able to do a lot more with. Lots of neat places to just hang out and enjoy.",2023-01-07
"Il primo parco Disney, inaugurato da Walt Disney in persona nel 1955. Nonostante si dica che Disneyland Paris sia migliore, credo che un appassionato Disney non possa perdersi anche questo parco, infatti molte attrazioni sono comunque differenti ed esclusive. Imperdibili: Incredicoaster, Indiana Jones adventure, Radiator Springs racers e Matterhorn Bobsleds",2023-01-02
It actually was quite nice not overcrowded no shoving and pushing I am in a wheelchair now and it was quite easy to maneuver getting on to the rides the workers were very helpful and getting my wheelchair onto the rides and getting them off it was amazing I didn't think I'd be able to go on anything and I was able to do the Haunted Mansion and small world,2023-01-01
"Disneyland is my official bonding place with my daughter, yes it gets crowded and lines are long, but the experience with characters, rides and fireworks are always good. Purchasing the annual pass is a great idea for us, we go atleast once a month or every other month. The savings and discounts from having an annual pass makes up for the upfront costs.",2023-01-03
"Disney is Disney, always a nice place to visit every once in awhile to see the new changes and relive your childhood memories. Service is always excellent in the Disney parks and so is the cleanliness. Wait times can be a bit long. Top attractions can easily be a 2 hour wait, but that should be expected especially when visiting on more of the peak days.",2023-01-06
"Happiest Place on Earth. Wish it would cost less though. Always prepare before visiting since it can be overwhelming. Aside from that, it is very fun! Lots of nostalgia and new visions from the future. I recommend Indiana Jones, Haunted Mansion, and the Star Wars rides. Food is also very good. Try out the Rose Tavern restaurant! Very good hamburgers.",2023-01-07

"What can be said about Disneyland that hasn’t already been said a million times? Plan your visit accordingly, hopefully on a slower day otherwise you may not be able to ride a lot of rides. In terms of theme parks, Disneyland is the gold standard. Every nook and cranny of this place is themed to their respective “lands.” Very immersive",2023-01-05
"The atmosphere in Disneyland was just soo amazing. It was something that you have never before experienced. There were soo many different attractions and places to go. The food here was wonderful but it was very expensive. Most things at Disneyland are though. Done of the lines were VERY long, but most of them were worth the wait",2023-01-05
"We had such a great time! The only thing that made this experience a little unhappy was how rude the employees were. For being the happiest place on earth, they need an attitude adjustment because they were not expressing happiness at all and this was every employee I encountered. Just plain rude and lack of customer service.",2023-01-07
"Disneyland is a magical place for people of all ages, with rides, shows and attractions that are sure to bring a smile to your face. It is important to purchase tickets in advance, arrive early, and take advantage of fastosa system. Be sure to bring a water bottle, sunscreen and comfortable shoes. Most importantly, have fun!",2023-01-03
"A ride stopped, than we couldn’t use the lighting lane. We did ride a canoe that was theee best part ….. honestly buying the lightning lane is great when rides work !! The ran out of happy birthday buttons … and didn’t even wanna help try to find one In a neighboring store on Main Street to it was only 8:30. Not nice!",2023-01-07
"How are you going to charge $200 dollars to go this stupid place and then close Adventureland without telling why? ""Theres an activity"" isn't a reason. Not to mention literally every ride broke down at least once. Also, half the employees are jerks who are rude for no reason. The other half at least are nice people.",2023-01-05
"We are from Los Angeles it's not like we go to Disneyland every year, it was my wife's birthday, got turned away, area code racism, we are disgusted, they give priority to people who are not from Los Angeles, I know I am just one more person in the world but now Your happiest Park turned out to be racial 👎👎👎👎👎",2023-01-06
Para quienes van recomiendo comprar los boletos con tiempo y desde la app. Ya en el lugar a mi me costaron 184dlls con tax cada boleto y desde la app salían en 109 porque fuimos entre semana pero por un problema con la app no los pude comprar.El precio del estacionamiento varía pero el más barato es 35 dlls.,2023-01-02
"10am “We’re full. No more tickets.” “Wut?” “You had to buy them online” “since when?” “2021” “I haven’t been here since 2019, how would we have known?””(smug shoulder shrug)”I get now why there’s a whole online universe of anti-Disney content.Oh welllll. We ended up having the best day in Old Towne Orange.",2023-01-07
As of today 10/11/23 two rides had shut down.  They evacuated us from hunted mansion to reopen the ride 15 minutes later. Indiana Jones at about 945pm. Just when i was about to get on the ride. I had purchased the lighting pass and they offered it with every closure. Well I already had it. So annoying 🙄,2023-01-03
"Disneyland California is simply magical! As corny as that sounds, the park does everything it can to bring you to a different time and place. Huge props for the Genie+ service, it made it so much easier to plan our day, reduce wait times and collect all your photos. Definitely worthy the add-on.",2023-01-03
"Es la peor experiencia que eh tenido en mi vida,se volvió un lugar donde tienes que pagar para todo,si quieres ir rapido en la línea pagas,te  ponen cierto tiempo de espera y se hace el doble,no sean aprovechados,ya no es un lugar de sueños ahora es una pesadilla,la verdad nunca vuelvo a venir",2023-01-07
