"I was a loyal shopper here essentially from the time they opened, bought thousands of dollars worth of cannabis from them, always had kind and amazing bud tenders & amazing staff.Todays experience for me ruined it all, a couple weeks ago I was approved by a doctor for California Medical Marijuana, this entitles a patient to 8 ounces of total product, whether dried or concentrated. I visited the shop the first time I got my card and was allowed to purchase a higher than recreational amount of concentrate for myself. I went back today to shop and after hitting 8 grams (including lightly infused pre rolls) I was no longer allowed to continue to use the benefits of my medical card. I explained to budtender what happened last time and he brought the manager “Joey” I explained to him the situation and state law, he disappeared to the back for several minutes before coming back and claiming I made up that I purchased more than was allowable and the system wouldn’t let them do that, he gave me an awful attitude about me wanting to void my transaction to maximize my deals on the product because I was no longer allowed to actually use my medical patient benefits, his proposal was to apply it to my girlfriend (this loses the ability to save in taxes and removes part of the point of having a medical card, besides increased limit of 8 ounces.)If Planet 13 is going to advertise and spicy themselves as being a Medical storefront they should understand the regulations and rules entirely. They do not. The customer service today was by far the worst I’ve experienced in my time at dispensaries around Southern California, from unsolicited advice and scoffing from a security guard they called to the invalid info and unprofessional service that spewed from the mouth of Joey. All around 0/10 experience, I had intended to use my credits and close my account entirely today to never visit again but unfortunately just left them to be never used again.This place is good if you want good bud tenders and quality rec product but as a medical establishment it just basically isn’t one and the management is pretty trash.",2023-01-05
"Store should be experienced! Reception staff excellent.Felt very rushed on the sales floor, and that the sales associate was very impatient. Especially since, it was our first time in the store, and we're unfamiliar with the products and would have liked more patience and assistance with helping us make our choices, as well as answering our questions. Especially since the store was relatively empty and only a couple of the sales associates were engaged with customers.The mustachioed bloke serving the THC infused alcohols was very informative and made for a fun experience purchasing our first cannabis infused distilled beverage!We'll be going back, whoever hope in the future that the sales staff focuses on being informative and educational about the products rather than knocking out a quick sale.",2023-01-06
"Planet 13 is like no other Cannabis shop. Usually Cannabis shops hide, not Planet 13. There is a huge red ball out front with water and steam flowing from it. It's impossible to miss Planet 13Inside this shop, it's spectacular! You are greeted by a wonderful staff who checks you in so you may receive what you are looking for quickly. The staff is educated. They have 25 registers, dozens of display cases with hundreds of different items. Not to mention a huge Octopus that is on display as a major decor item. They have excellent prices, such as 3.5 grams for $18. They sell practically everything, bongs, electronic vapers, shirts, baseball caps, and edibles. They are not a store, they are an experience.",2023-01-06
"This place is great especially when you get the right budtender who is helpful and doesn't look like they hate their job. I went in at noon today and had Cindy or Sydney and she wasn't very helpful at all and was kinda snobby and kept giving me rude looks when I asked questions about the concentrate I was trying to buy. I asked if they were saucy diamonds rather than just rocks and she looked at me like I was dumb and just said ""they are diamonds."" great place but that girl isn't a very good at her job go work at a fast food restaurant with that attitude chicka. I've been here hundreds of times and everybody is cool so far except for cindy/Sydney. Best of luck. 👍🏼",2023-01-06
"Terrible experience waiting…. and waiting… after watching 10 people who came after me being serviced I asked the front desk what is going on and was told “oh you’re next”… and then I go back to the lobby to only watch another 5 people get serviced after me… and FINALLY after 30 Minutes of waiting someone came to me to ask what my name is.. saying “there’s a glitch in our system”. Anyways, needless to say I won’t be coming back here. I don’t recommend this place anymore. Service quality is terrible. The batches of marijuana are months old. Not a great dispensary anymore which is sad because I use to think they were the best",2023-01-06
"Had an awful experience @ mr.shittyguy and P13 turned it all the way around for me. Toy is the best in the world, every time I'm done shopping with her I leave with such a big smile and I'm always confident in the product I purchased. Mr.hustleguy is nothin but super old weed that's been stuck in their warehouse for too long and a bunch of hotdog water carts. Planet 13 is a real dispo and will never leave you feeling tricked or taken advantage of. Just to reiterate TOY IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD and mr.FinesseGuy can burn to the ground. Ask about the discount products behind the counter. Budget FIRE",2023-01-05
"Easily the best dispensary in Southern California. From their daily deals to their vast selection of flower, concentrates, and oils, Planet 13 is unrivaled in the local recreational cannabis market. Check out their delivery option and you can save significantly with a first time order and expect prompt and professional service. The budtenders are well versed in their knowledge of the plant and it's medicinal benefits and can direct first time or longtime consumers to the correct product.Highly recommended, check out the Vegas location when you're on your next vacation.",2023-01-07
"This is my 2nd delivery from Planet 13. And I love it!!!  Today, the delivery man, Justin, came right to my garage door as I instructed, within record time. He said howdy, was quick to check my ID, and handed me my lovely blue bag containing my 4 cartridges and was on his way. Everything I ordered online was in the bag. Planet 13 gives nice discounts (20%) when you get deliveries. Their online inventory of vape cartridges is massive, prices are great and better than all of the other local dispensaries. Way to go Planet 13!! I’m a loyal customer for sure.",2023-01-07
Not the worst clinic but they advertise all these deals and then when you go to ask about them they act like they don’t want to give it to you. They didn’t give my husband his 30% off first time patient and he had to go back to let them know and they made it difficult for him to get a refund. They also switched the product out in not only his bag but mine as well and did not tell us about it. We received completely different products than we asked because they were out. Very deceiving and seems like the place is trying to scam you.,2023-01-07
"Hey there, first time Shopper here at Planet 13 and I got to see the experience with them was so awesome. Besides the fact that they had what I was looking for I was informed by the employee named Ryan about the properties of the products that I'm buying and what actually benefits me and what do I really need. This type of information was never given to me in any other dispensary and I highly recommend Planet 13 for you to come back and experience the best shopping for legal recreational marijuana.",2023-01-03
"Justin took care of my delivery order on 4th of July; he was on time, was communicative about his ETA and arrival. and was very pleasant. Extra kudos for working on a holiday. 10/10 experience. Planet 13 is without a doubt my go-to dispensary with its huge selection of products, and multiple purchase options (in store, curbside, delivery). I also have enjoyed all of my budtenders recommendations so far, they always seem to find the right product for what I’m looking for at the moment",2023-01-07
Horrible the bud tenders have no idea what they are talking about and can't do basic math without being rushed to the counter and then asked if you want buds of which you stated all you were there for was a bong. Taylor she is rude doesn't know what a bong is called wants to call it everything except a bong and has no idea what she's doing. You're only as strong as your weakest employee and she's the weakest horrible go somewhere else and this was my first time there and last,2023-01-07
Just came in today and I get it there's a wait but for an employee to just skip your name and go to another person is rediculous then when I bring it to the managers attention he just says ohh someone will be right with you... Um excuse me I wouldn't ask if I didnt just see people get helped who came after me. Dude pay attention to your customers and what there saying worst type of manager there is. Don't bother asking the short dude with no hair he's no help,2023-01-08
"I had a great experience today! I've been to many dispensaries. First time I've been to a Planet 13. I was very impressed. The selection and service cannot be topped. My bud tender, Max, was phenomenal! I couldn't ask for better service. Everyone was very friendly. Max helped me find exactly what I needed. I'm a very picky person. I wasn't rushed one bit! I'm very pleased with all the flower I purchased. Great sales on flower, too! I shall return!",2023-01-07
I went to planet 13 for the very first time and I was greeted by a young lady by the name of Gabby she helped me find what I was looking for she was very helpful she gave me a lot of good info on certain weeds that I didn't even know they had and I only want to tell her thank you for making my first time experience a good one and I will be back to see you later thank you Gabby I really appreciate your help new customer will be returning,2023-01-06
"P13 thought Santa Ana was Vegas and they were going to come in and dominate the Market, but they realized that there is 10 dispensaries on every block, In Santa Ana we don't care about the all the bells and whistles, This is not a tourist town, we look for the best deals, not looking to buy $80 8ths, hope to see more Ounce deals but P13 is just like these other commercial dispensaries that got a reality check once they came to Socal.",2023-01-06
"It was my first time visiting the orange county location and I received excellent and knowledgable service from Ryan. Throughout the time spent asking questions and getting to know the selection available, Ryan informed me a lot about which brands are best for focusing. For me this was something I had never received expert help pertaining to cannabis for focus before, at any dispensary. Thanks for the help Ryan at P13!",2023-01-02
"This store was cool. Low pressure sales tactics. they were respectful of my wishes to browse then let me tell them what i wanted., The layout was not confusing just the signs for the products should have dangled over the products so you knew where to find items. They are all in glass cases and it looks like a jewelry store which was nice. I just felt like I had to hunt around for products",2023-01-06
I would like to say that I love your store. I do have a problems with one cashier. She is a tall girl with long curly hair and was working at register 6 on August 8th. This isn't the first time I've spent more than 100.00 dollars. I watched her give someone else free stuff and I got nothing. I don't usually complain but she has done it before and I feel discriminated against. Thank you.,2023-01-07
"Cool place, prices are high though and they require a $80 minimum for delivery.  Which is $30 more than anyone else in the area.  This is more of a novelty for first timers and people new to the area.  The other places may not have the atmosphere but you could definitely find better deals elsewhere with the same options.  Not the best place for a connoisseur of Cannabis.",2023-01-06
"Even though everyone is quite knowledgeable and very efficient at their job, I find that compared to other local dispensaries this place marks up their products significantly. That's not just including the 33% tax for Santa Ana and the State. Seriously though, there's better places with a 1/2mile radius of here. Please go to my dispensary top 10 for better ideas.",2023-01-05
"Biggest selection of products and brands in Orange County and at really good prices. On top of that there are different deals every day. The mix and match 1/2 oz deal that comes up is ridiculous. Any 4 8ths in the store for $135. Every time that deal comes up I’m loading up on all my top shelf brands like CBX, Northern Emeralds, UpNorth, Fig Farms, and Maven.",2023-01-05
"This place is great! I really like how open it is inside, and all of the displays. Some of the comparable stores in the area are less open and I feel that who is helping you had a greater influence on what you end up with. since this place is so open, it's easy to browse and I feel a bit less pressure to buy what's in front of me. def will be going back.",2023-01-08
The biggest and coolest dispensary in the area. Never a long wait as they have plenty of staff. They have lots of daily deals and the staff comes out and meets you on the sales floor and actually listens to what you want and make recommendations based off of what you say.Taxes are a motherfu..... But you do what you gotta do to support legalization.,2023-01-05
"This place is so amazing! They have so many different choices and options to choose from for cannabis, and the staff there are incredibly helpful. I was helped by Ryan, and he was so educational, kind, and informative of what I wanted to get. He was equally helpful as he was knowledgeable about the product, and I can’t wait to return to this place!",2023-01-02
"Great team of people with a wide variety of products. Being my 2nd Plent13 I've visited, the differences are obviously. This location was much smaller than the Vegas location and had no Lil Wayne products at the moment. I was helped by kind guy with humo products. Thanks for all your help and  look forward to visiting any planet 13 again",2023-01-06
"Great choice of products. Excellent curb-side service. The driver Justin kept me updated on when he would arrive and give me a spot on time. Very courteous and professional. The store itself is amazing if you do go there in person, but you can’t beat the not only free but discounted home delivery!   A+++",2023-01-07
"As someone who buys green from the Netherlands, I have to say that this store is very progressive and nice. Helpful and friendly staff members who know their products.However, what's up with the due date? I bought mid may but apparently some expire in a few month or already did. See pictures. Let's see.",2023-01-07
"Great selection and prices. Worst costumer service of any dispensary in OC. There are more than 50 registers with less than 5 people working. Employees sit and chat while people are waiting. Do not come here if you are in a hurry. Actually, don't even come if you have anything to do in the next hour.",2023-01-07
"Gran atención al cliente con personas capacitadas por cada producto. Tienen una variedad muy amplia de productos para todo tipo , incluso aceites y cremas com CBD. El espacio está amplio y limpio. Había visto que hablan español pero ese día nos atendieron en inglés. La atención muy rápida y amable.",2023-01-08
"2 bad experiences and I am done.  Workers are nice, but some managers are extremely rude and just lie most of time.  And super expensive.  They will try to hook you in by various discount, they will take discount away if they don't feel like it.  There is no consistency.  Pathetic operation.",2023-01-08
"BAD BUSINESS MOVE PLANETThis place is beautiful and screams money. Disarming your guards is a bad move. I don't blame everyone for walking out on you. Putting your employees in danger doesn't keep employees, protecting your employees keeps your business in business. Good luck 👍🏻",2023-01-07
Freddy thank you!! for being always so professional and kind and let's not forget to mention your great big smile makes my day sometimes. Thank you for always having that upbeat personality this is the kind of customer service that I definitely look for thank you so much. 🙏,2023-01-08
"Was a favorite store, and I'm a regular customer.  But the last two times the consultant brings the wrong product that I asked for.  Wanted to buy Jeeters Orange Soda and Green Crack yesterday, got Orange Daiquiri and Trainwreck instead.  Disappointed and won't be back.",2023-01-05
Stopped into Planet 13 & it doesn't disappoint!  There's so much to choose from. Super clean. Huge building w/awesome layout. I was helped by register #8 💚 he was super helpful... fast service. I live out of area but hoping to come back again on my next visit out here.,2023-01-07
My friends and i had an amazing first time experience with our budtender Toy!! She was so knowledgeable and had very good recommendations. She’s also such an amazing and charming individual that made me feel so taken care of. 10/10 recommend Toy to take care of you!!,2023-01-05
Used bait and switch ad in the email marketing plan. Advertised a half ounce of flower but only gave a quarter ounce when I came in. Planet 13 ripped me off for 40 bucks. Manager said too bad. Still have bogus ad for Tyson half Oz. For 65 dollars YOU OWE ME 40 bucks!,2023-01-06
"Always very a great spot to stop by, when I’m on the road right off the freeway and very easy to get too.Ryan helped me out so much today was very patient with me on deciding my meds, 10/10 on customer service , give my man a raise “Thank you and much love planet 13",2023-01-03
"Miles was so helpful and knowledgeable on all the products, I appreciated his input and honesty. The best experience I’ve had in a dispensary. Adrianna at the front desk was so friendly! Will definitely stop in again before my trip ends and during my next stay.",2023-01-05

"First timer, they charged me incorrect amount $120 instead $98 on flower! I didn't like the cash advance with an atm fee (just weird for these days) plus you pay for everything there no such thing as a decent deal to be honest essentially for regulars..",2023-01-06
Best store I have ever been to.  Beautiful clean atmosphere not a place you would mind going to. I always order on line (since I know what I'm looking for) and pick up in store.  Very convenient.  The staff are the nicest people and very knowledgeable.,2023-01-07
First ti.e here and all I can say is wow. Prices are reasonable and facilities are amazing. Their budtenders are on point like a decimal! All questions and concerns are addressed without making you feel like a shaved tail louie. Mad respect for P13!!,2023-01-07
"David and a couple of others who have helped me, really go above and beyond to make sure I will be happy with my product. They understand the product and keep the experience fun and exciting. Never been dissatisfied with David’s customer service.",2023-01-06
"Good staff but one big problem, been coming to this place for a couple of years… there’s been multiple times I’ve gotten really old dry tasteless cannabis that’s been sitting over a year and months. Not cool at all, especially for their prices.",2023-01-08
"Good service and they always have good deals Justin called me ahead of time letting me know how far he was and where he was ,it saves me the trip of driving to santa ana, I like to order a day ahead of time and it gets here pretty early",2023-01-07
Everyone was so nice. The person the helped us was very knowledgeable and helpful.  Excellent customer service. Lots of good choices here. Great product too.  The only down side is the steep taxes.  But that's not planet 13's fault.,2023-01-07
Planet 13 has a huge variety of whatever you need! The delivery is perfect for me since I don't drive. My delivery driver Justyn was very knowledgeable and was helpful in the questions I had. The discounts and freebies are great!,2023-01-07

"Lots of turnover recently, so unfortunately the newer staff isn't as knowledgeable. I find the manager to be unpleasant to work with. It's a cool store though. I like all the beautiful art they've incorporated.",2023-01-05
Been to this store for a while they change workers but now there customer service is really lacking went in today and they never called my name the last time the girl that attended us wanted to rush me out,2023-01-06
