"I recently had the unfortunate experience of becoming a customer of Absolute You, and am extremely disappointed with their services. I had high hopes for this fitness studio, but they have managed to let me down at every turn. Allow me to explain why my experience with Absolute You has left me feeling frustrated and dissatisfied.First and foremost, Absolute You seemed to be more focused on selling trial packages than on providing a quality fitness experience. It became evident that they were more interested in making a quick buck rather than catering to their existing customers. Despite the increase in trial packages sold, they failed to expand their class offerings to accommodate the growing number of attendees. As a result, the classes were overcrowded, making it nearly impossible to enjoy a workout without feeling cramped and uncomfortable. It's disheartening to see a company prioritize profit over the satisfaction of its loyal customers.To make matters worse, the process of booking classes at Absolute You was a complete nightmare. I found it incredibly frustrating and time-consuming to secure a spot in the classes I wanted to attend. Their booking system was inefficient and glitchy, often crashing or displaying inaccurate class availability. It was incredibly discouraging to spend hours trying to book a class only to find out that it was already full or that the system had falsely indicated its availability. It's astonishing that a fitness studio would overlook such a fundamental aspect of customer satisfaction.In my attempt to address these issues, I reached out to Absolute You's customer service, hoping for a resolution or at least an acknowledgment of the problem. Instead, all I received was a shallow gesture of extending my trial package by a month. This so-called ""gesture of goodwill"" was nothing more than a useless response to the recurring issues I encountered. Extending my trial package did not address the underlying problems of overcrowded classes and a faulty booking system. It only served as a reminder of Absolute You's inability to effectively manage their services and provide a satisfactory customer experience.As someone who values their time, money, and fitness goals, I expected better from Absolute You. Unfortunately, they have failed to live up to even the most basic standards of service and value. I cannot recommend Absolute You to anyone who seeks a quality fitness experience and genuine customer care. I hope they take these criticisms constructively and work towards improving their services for the sake of their customers' satisfaction.And yes, this was written by ChatGPT because I just can't even anymore.",2023-01-02
"Always a fantastic and fun workout that ends with smiles and sweat dripping! You can feel the burn after every session.Accessible and not too intimidating for newer riders - a lot of help and guidance given in the Beginner and Foundation classes, and there is a strong emphasis on getting the form right, and also no pressure if we need to take a seat and rest (unlike some spin studios with little to zero attention paid to our form and with bootcamp-style classes that lowkey shame people for taking a break).The workouts are definitely intense enough for intermediate and advanced riders as well. The instructors are knowledgeable, patient, approachable, give good vibes, and can hype up everyone to push and do our best. Choreo is fun but not too complicated; more focused on the burn and the correct form as mentioned.Counter staff are friendly and polite. Waiting / lounge areas are kept clean and comfortable, though not very spacious. In the female toilet, many shower cubicles are available, with good shampoo & conditioner & body wash provided. I love the Loreal Extraordinary Oil ones! There is also deodorant, body lotion, makeup remover, hairdryer, etc, at the mirror areas. Plenty of clean towels are provided too.Cons: Bikes may be a tad too close to each other, especially in the back rows. A few of the lockers have iffy locks that malfunction at times. Some of the shoes and bikes look a little old and well-used, could be better maintained, though this does not affect the functionality. I'm not a fan of the shower curtain (instead of a door) for privacy reasons - it's not completely opaque - and also because it tends to float inwards with the air flow to almost touch you during the shower. :/Side note: I didn't attend the pilates sessions here, but their pilates rooms look crowded with big class sizes, which may not be ideal for some people as reformer pilates in particular often requires more personalized attention. That being said, such an arrangement might be alright for the average beginner to try out pilates workouts as a start.",2023-01-06
"I would be delighted to write a positive review for a spin boutique studio!I recently had the pleasure of visiting this fantastic spin boutique studio, and I have to say that I was blown away by the experience. From the moment I walked through the doors, I was greeted with warmth and enthusiasm by the friendly staff who made me feel right at home.The studio itself was impeccably clean and beautifully designed, with a modern and stylish atmosphere that was both energizing and calming at the same time. The state-of-the-art equipment was top-notch, and I felt completely comfortable and supported throughout my entire workout.But what really sets this spin boutique studio apart from the rest is the quality of the instruction. The instructors are all incredibly knowledgeable, passionate, and motivating, and they go above and beyond to make sure that every class is challenging, fun, and rewarding.Overall, I cannot recommend this spin boutique studio highly enough. Whether you're a seasoned spinner or a newbie looking to get into shape, this studio is the perfect place to challenge yourself, improve your fitness, and have a great time while doing it. So if you're looking for a positive and transformative spin experience, look no further than this amazing studio!",2023-01-03
Absolute is Amazing most of the trainers push your limit till you wanna burst but at the end of the sess you feel light and liberated. Only thing i wish @AbsoluteCycleSingapore would do is make an Unlimited package for spin classes per month for all studios. Meaning like $300/ month for an unlimited spin package access to all studios. Its more affordable and i guarantee more new comers Will come on board. The reason why i suggest to allow the package to be used throughout all the studios is because each customer has their favorite instructor they prefer to follow. The instructors don't just stay in one studio they float around between the 4 studios set up now. I personally feel a bit of an inconvenience if my favorite instructor is being sent to different places but my package is only accepted to one studio which he or she isn't teaching at frequently. I would feel the stress of having to pay so much to get the ultimate spin package that costs $4K plus and even with their 25% discount it is still way above budget just to float around to catch my favorite instructors class.Just saying F45 does the monthly payment of $300+ / month with unlimited access. Food for thought. Highly suggest this idea is way better.,2023-01-06
"Great instructors but impossible to book any slot for reformer classes (both on website and on APP). I usually go with 3 friends and we book diligently at 10pm daily with multiple devices on different classes that falls on weekdays between 7-9pm. If we’re lucky, only one of us will get into a single digit waiting list which usually will be enrolled the day before the class. Yes it is affordable here but since the package has expiry, it is fairly expensive with the number of classes you will end up wasting (or enter into a frustration phase of kept trying to book everyday to finish the package like me, your choice). If I were to pay for more expensive classes, I would rather stick with Upside Motion, the classes there are smaller (you can spread ur arms fully without hitting others or the mirror unlike Absolute) and the machine there has better quality. FYI, I’m with absolute for almost a year and I had this frustration since my signup, naively believed that the difficulty to book is just temporary because we were on trial and it will be better after I signup. So for those who are planning to signup with the intention to only go for after working hours classes like myself, I strongly suggest you reconsider!",2023-01-05
"The mobile app and web interface for booking classes is by far the most disappointing I have encountered. Every day at 10pm, when the slots for the following week become available, the site becomes unbearably slow due to the high volume of users attempting to book classes. You are left uncertain about the success of your booking until you receive an email confirmation.God knows how many more packages they have sold compared to the actual number of available slots. One might even suspect that they are banking on the expiration of your package validity before you can fully utilize it.When I encountered issues with my package, I submitted a ticket through their Zendesk platform. I received a response only five days later, by which time they had already implemented changes without my approval. When I requested them to revert these changes, I was informed that it was not possible. Seeking assistance from their branch staff in person proved futile. I received a call from them promising a callback, but it never happened. Subsequent email exchanges have gone unanswered, and it has now been 32 days without resolution.",2023-01-04
I bought the pilates reformer trial package in March and we have to finish 4 lessons within 1 month. However they only allow booking via their app and I would say that is the worst booking system and app that I have experienced. They open the following week’s slot at 10pm everyday and within 5 mins all the classes will show “no slot available”. Apparently they oversold the package and there is certainly more signs up than slot available.And the app always either hang or lagged or showed error message. Terrible experience and I have written in multiple times and what they can do for me is just to extend my package by one more month for me to use. But that doesn’t solve the issue! I still couldn’t secure any classes even I log in on the dot at 10pm. This is super ridiculous and they ignore my request for a refund. I would strongly recommend my friends and family not to sign up any classes with Absolute You because the booking system is super stressful and frustrating. Leave this comment because we don’t want more victims like us.,2023-01-02
"A studio who rather waste time to come up with a new website than to put in time and effort to improve the lagging on their booking app.Can't believe that the app is more than 4 years old and it still lag so much. Also, the app requires riders to keep clicking on the bike for more than 7 minutes every night to secure a bike.Literally an ABSOLUTE waste of time. It is unacceptable that each class cost S$22 or more yet this is the quality of the application provided. Please do something about your application before more of your riders leave for your competitor studios.No amount of good instructors you have can solve your issue of a lack of communication. It takes days to get a respond by email and the phone number has been perpetually occupied 24/7 for the past 4 years. The only way to get basic customer support is to go down to the studio. Even with that, one has to pray for a decent front of house who either has the authority or know how to update the system.Do better before your regular decides to vote with their pockets.",2023-01-06
"I have been studio hopping for a while to try out different spin studios. I realize the differentiating factor is the personality of the instructor and the effort they put in to remember and understand you.Some instructors treat you as customer. Others don’t even realize you are there after attending 5 consecutive days of classes. But this is not to be said of Jia En. She treats her every riders as friend, caring and fostering a strong sense of community. In the process, the bond of a family gets build and we ride longer, further and harder with her leading our pack. Jia En is the reason why many of us stayed with the studio despite how hard it is to book her ride.Riders get to know of JE before they hear of Absolute. People recognize individual who put in the consistent hard work to build a community that they can ride safely and call home. People acknowledge Jie En.",2023-01-07
"Pilates classes are pretty good BUT their system and processes are ridiculous.DO NOT RECOMMEND if you’ve yet to purchase any packages because it’s impossible to book classes after office hours. I’m not even talking about signing yourself up for waitlist, because even the WAITLIST IS FULL all the time. Unless you’re not limited by office hours. Booking starts at 10pm daily but their system hangs and lags very badly, by the time you even get to load, you’ll be on early waitlist if you’re lucky.While it’s understandable that Absolute wants to push for sales and keeps throwing out ridiculously affordable packages, it’s ridiculous that they’re not increasing supply in peak hours and further limit package usage across studios.Eventually, my friends and I have to forfeit our paid / complimentary classes because there’s absolutely no slots.",2023-01-06
I wouldn’t recommend purchasing a package here. The instructors are great and the facilities are nice but it is IMPOSSIBLE to book a class. They are released at 10pm the week prior and within Seconds the spots are filled and the waitlist is so long you will never make it off and into the class. This sounds like an exaggeration but it really isn’t. The memberships and deals are continuously sold so the member numbers keep climbing while the studio sizes and number of equipment pieces do not. I’m sure it’s not the intention but it sure feels like a scam to sell unusable packages for fitness classes.The app is also quite possibly the worst fitness booking app in the world.Changing my review slightly because I think the limited availability may be due to covid and not actually their fault :/ and they have added an extra room now!,2023-01-07
"Generally, I love the workout classes and you can really start to feel and see the difference in your body after a few sessions (coupled with proper dieting).The reformer classes can get quite intense especially for first timers who don't work out regularly, so it can get difficult to hold planks. But I absolutely love the workout, and every session changes up a little.It's a fuss free gym as well, no hard counter pushing. Just turn up, sign in, and attend the class.The amenities is well provided for, with towels, showers, lockers, water dispenser and a few drinks option (tea and coffee).The downside would be the booking system because slots flies off the shelf immediately after the system opens for booking at 10pm.And, the pricing is relatively competitive compared to other gyms offering the same services.",2023-01-06
"Would have given 0 stars if possible.Do not buy any packages from this place.It’s a scam. My friends and i bought the trial package and we were not able to book for any classes at all and now it’s expired. I requested for a refund since we were not able to book for ANY OF THE CLASSES. It is always full. We are looking to get a refund for our trial package but the customer service person is not helpful at all. I am not trying to ask for a refund after i have went to the classes. I DID NOT EVEN MANAGE TO BOOK ANY EVEN WHEN I WAITED AT 10PM TO ENTER THE APP. Their solutions were those that were stated in the email. Honestly, do not sell any package if you are incapable of taking in anymore customers.  Please refund us.",2023-01-07
"Was a regular for both the spin and reformer. The studios are nice and clean, and the instructors are all fairly good.But in the last 2 months (Mar & Apr-23), booking a class was a nightmare - Absolute ran promotions such that demand outstripped the supply of classes.It was SOO difficult secure book a slot despite me trying to book at 10pm the week before (when classes get released).When I wrote in to ask for >1 week extension got flatly rejected - telling me that I had bulked purchased and enjoyed the discount. What is the point of me buying ANY packages when I can't even book a class. It's like saying free refill when there is no drinks. Such false advertising.",2023-01-05
"I am a beginner to reformer pilates and attended my second class which was taught by Celia. I was horrified and stressed throughout the class because she assumed everyone to be regulars, and did not give clear instructions or helped to guide the beginners in any way. Other than this, when i did not have the springs in place for one of the exercises, she sighed loudly, sneered at me, and rudely called me out in front of the class in a very condescending tone. Even the rest of the class seemed shocked at her tone and hurried to help me out.I would suggest to stay away from her classes if you do not wish to be traumatised, especially if you are a beginner!",2023-01-01
"Had my first Spin cycling experience at Absolute in 2019 and I was completely hooked! I love the instructors, the music and the vibes when we are spinning in the dark with flashy lights.It's been 2 years and I m still hooked. Love how everyone brings their best self to the room - especially the instructions. They often remind us to be kind to our bodies, our minds and ourselves, yet encourage us to always give out best.  There is no other spin class place that is as addictive and fun! If you are hesitant on trying, give it a go and see how it fits you. I m glad I started, its a journey I don't ever want to stop.",2023-01-07
"Spacious, relatively new (opened in Nov 2020?) studio with both pilates reformer and spin classes...The spin instructors are essentially a bunch of energiser bunnies who deliver a smashing workout on the bikes - every class is a party!Meanwhile, the reformer instructors are quiet ""terrors"" who are warming encouraging through killer pulses and nudge you towards a crazy burn with tiny movements with the reformers!!This is the only Absolute studio with both spin and reformer pilates (the others only have spin), which is a tad of a pity, but this is the modt accessible one (for northsiders lol) so that works great!",2023-01-08
"Ever since I started Pilates, I did my research for a good studio in SG and settle for Absolute. I must say, I really love and enjoy it here! Every instructor is versatile in the way they teach and have different intensities. Some days, I just want to have a chill workout, some days intense. I enjoyed every class I have taken in the past! The facilities and staffs are also amazing!I eventually succumb to joining Rhythm Cycle. I LOVE IT! The sweat, music, cardio and endurance!!!! Everything about Absolute is perfect for me. You have gained a loyal client :)",2023-01-02
"Forget about ever getting into popular classes even with waitlist as it appears to be not first come first serve after all but rather the slots went to“premium” students! First time booking a session at the Centrepoint outlet and was utterly disappointed! Was on waitlist for days on end and on the day itself could clearly see the queue position going back and forth which indicated a flaw in their booking system! Never experienced that with Millennia Walk and Star Vista outlets which are more systematic with their booking/waitlist system, just this outlet!",2023-01-01
"Okay let’s be honest. It’s quite challenging to book a slot as a beginner. If you contact them and you understand how the waiting list works at the end it’s alright. Now let’s talk about the classes, the places and the instructors. Everything it’s good, almost perfect. It will deserve 5 stars if the reservation system will change in the future, or just add a bit more classes per day and everyone will be happy. It’s one the best place to learn, enjoy spin here in Singapore. Great job Absolute and see you very soon 😉",2023-01-07
"Do not recommend anyone to purchase any packages from them. The booking system is a issue. I bought the trial package and every week I am unable to book for any classes. When the slot release, it is always fully booked. Why offer trial packages when the classes are always booked ? Others do not have a fair chance to book for classes. Feel like this is a scam and it is not honest of them to do this to customers. Had emailed them regarding this issue and hope to resolve this issue.",2023-01-07
"To be honest, I think they oversold the package and it is super hard to book a slot. Took me one month and still not able to enrol any classes. The hassle of going through class booking is extremely stressful and totally kills the motivation for working out.For those who have signed up for the package - Too bad! You just got to deal with this.For those who have not signed up any packages - Congrats! My suggestion is to explore other alternatives! 😉",2023-01-06
I think this must be a cheating money tactic and I believe there are a lot of people out there buying their packages and did not manage to attend or booked even 1 of the classes!! It’s harder to book 1 class than snatch Jay Chou concert ticket !! Decided to share my experience after seeing so many people complaining. Stop selling so many packages when you don’t not have that many slots for all your customers or Just close down already,2023-01-07
I just travelled 45 mins for a Pilates class and was turned away and offered no alternative because it is “advanced”. Maybe call it “advanced Pilates” if it’s advanced…. Or write in the confirmation email “not suitable for beginners”. Or double check with ClassPass to make sure that it is unavailable to book for first timers. Or at least offer me an alternative class considering I’ve wasted 2 hours of travel…????? Literally what,2023-01-06
"Paid $59 for 4 trial lessons. Absolute nightmare of a booking system. Booking opens up at 10am every night, app lags like mad, by the time it’s 1020, every spot is unavailable / taken, I’m on waitlist number 20-40, it’s impossible to get a class and the package only lasts 4 weeks. My friend wasn’t refunded a credit or allowed to extend her package even though she caught Covid. Lousy booking system and inflexible team. Yikes",2023-01-05
"You go there to buy a package but is treated as a burden. You ask a question and instead of her using her mind to answer you, you get faces and a big blur. Does she not understand her own system to be able to explain? What she wants is no question at all and just payment. After firmly telling her you don’t appreciate her attitude she acuse you of yelling. Really??ZERO basic customer service to as simple as buying package.",2023-01-01
I bought trial session with terms must be use up by 1 month. However the pilates / reformer class is always full even with advance booking of 7 days ahead ( class was only release weekly)I put on waitlist but rank 24th. I called in and write to support no one answer. Ask for refund at their shop but they refuse refund . Really don’t make sense and felt cheated. Really disappointed and definitely wont sign up anymore.,2023-01-05
"My to-go for pilates 😌 I don’t really use the shower but it’s still good enough! I would prefer pilates room 1 for my classes than room 2. Room 2 feels a little suffocating, energy draining somehow. Room 1 has natural light maybe that’s why? Just preference. Instructors are great, the pace of class is really fast so would suggest you to have a little more experience on reformer before going there. Overall, love it!",2023-01-06
"Had my first spin after much persuasion from my friends back in September 2019. I must say it did not disappoint!!! My first few class, the instructors were very encouraging and helpful to beginners like me. And have always enjoyed every class that I have!Staff was friendly and helpful, always greet you with your name. Bikes were clean ! Can’t find things to complain about this place. I super love ABSOLUTE!",2023-01-07
Have reached 2 mins before the class and it was shocking to be informed the slot has been released to someone else. Was not even aware this was even possible. It’s not a pleasant encounter given I have rushed down from work. Further it’s almost impossible to get a slot on the booking system.Would not recommend to buy the package from absolute as they have oversold classes with supply less than demand…,2023-01-01
"Been attending their classes for a while now and I must say this is good place for building up a foundation whether for pilates or spin. love the energy of the instructors!however, it's very challenging to book classes when the slots open at 10pm. I find the app has been getting worse, it lags and then hangs, can absolute please improve on this? other than that, I like attending classes here :)",2023-01-04
"My first introduction to spin was at Absolute close to 3 years ago now, and have stuck with them since! Instructors are always full of great energy, encouraging yet challenging us riders to do our best. Facilities like showers are also clean, and there's instant coffee and tea available at CTP too. Definitely recommend for those new to spin - always a good burn 🔥",2023-01-05
"A nice studio for pilate workout. The instructors are very friendly and professional; always there to help when you need them. Good vibes and energy!The only setback is that classes are difficult to book due to high demand and the app always lag or hang, resulting in not being able to secure the desired class. Hope Absolute can look into upgrading the app 😀",2023-01-05
Customer service at frontdesk was unfriendly. Very strict rules. Can't join the class if you're 3 mins late. No flexibility given eventhough it was heavy rain with heavy traffic during early morning rush. And class was only half full. My friend arrived at 8.02am but wasn't allowed to join the 8am class. Note that they might also impose a late fee penalty!,2023-01-06
"Absolute You offers a fun and energetic spin as well as great reformer pilates classes. They have a few outlets in Singapore - all locations of great convenience. I absolutely love Absolute and I have been joining them as an active member since a colleague of mine introduce me. Come and experience it yourself, I’m sure you’ll enjoy it as much as I do.",2023-01-07
"As a first time customer who bought the trial package, the booking system is absolutely horrible. There are absolutely NO available classes for booking everything is on waitlist. Even if I login to try to reserve a class at 10pm, the whole app hangs and is super laggy. When the app is finally able to load, every class that I can attend is on waitlist",2023-01-06
"The largest, newest studio and also my favourite one! Love that it is spacious with lots of seating areas and lockers that are well spread out, where you can catch your breath and just chill for a while as opposed to having to rush out of a cramped studio asap. Also the most convenient one of all AND with pilates reformer classes as added option!",2023-01-07
I went for the trial class at RP outlet for Pilate reformer class. The Instructor named Cass. Not friendly at all. I don't really enjoy the class experience.Their instructor at centerpoint is better but slot very hard to book!!! always full or on waiting list forever.Really depends on the instructor..I enjoy Vanie class. She is not bad.,2023-01-02
"Great studios, great cs team n great instructors. Love both centrepoint n star vista staff for their friendliness n helpfulness. Shout out to spin instructors Vnex, JE, Brian, Ria, Shaun, Una n Zul for making every ride as fun as it could get! Also, Pilates instructors, Nicole n Vanie (n Vnex) again for making us work!!! U guys rock!!!",2023-01-03
"Where are our favourite instructors?Also, app is pretty dated and hard to use.So vs ClassPass...Excellent appFlexibilityvsCumbersome appLocked in packages with tons of rules and fine printSudden change of lineup of instructors (hey we bought packages expecting the instructors would be there)It's clear where we should place our $$",2023-01-06
"Absolute center point is like my second home. Studio is spacious with very good vibes. Equipment is well spaced out and cleaned after use. But the highest compliment goes to the instructors. They  are best of the best, always patient and at the same time try to kill you every single time. Look for Chris’ class. He is the best!",2023-01-07
"Classes are extremely hard to book. Within 2 hours of new classes being released, I was number 20 something on the waitlist. So if you have a package, there is a risk you might not finish using the package before it expires. Think carefully,  call up to ask more detailed questions before you throw your hard-earned money away.",2023-01-01
I’ve never seem a worse customer service. They simply do not reply your email anymore in the middle of a conversation and just leave the problem unsolved. I’m stunned by how irresponsible the customer service person is. Super disappointed and would definitely explore other pilates studio after the current package is finished.,2023-01-06
"Absolute is a great place for beginners to start their spin class experience! The instructors and staff in general are very encouraging, patient and just nice all around. The outlets are also all in super accessible places, which makes it easier to commit to a class. Looking forward to a long journey with Absolute!",2023-01-05
"The cycling and pilates instructors were wonderfully nice and professional. I felt safe n productive in the trial class. However their lite package, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, has withdrawn and therefore am unable to continue the pilates class.  I bought 4 new pilate socks for nothing. SAD. So I can only enjoy cycling.",2023-01-06
Centrepoint studio : Clean and spacious studio with pantry and cosy waiting areas. Shower and Lockers facilities. Friendly counter staff. I enjoy the reformer pilates classes conducted in the studios. Instructors are professional. Agree with most review that they need to improve on their booking system.,2023-01-03
"Bad customer service - continued to be so, even after years & left email reviews (which they ignored & blocked me LOL) - better off to go Revo Raffles Place or Aurora Suntec or ALLY which is sooo much better!!!TBH any other spin class is better than Absolute. Am glad I’m finally finishing my package.",2023-01-06
Been trying to contact customer service for a few days. Line is always not picked up. Did not respond to email and did not receive a call back. Not sure how else customer service can be contacted. Seems like it’s intentional because I have been calling repeatedly. Booking system is another issue 😅,2023-01-02
"Absolute's reformer pilates classes are one of the cheapest in singapore, and with good instructors! Bought the trial package to try and ended up buying more pilates classes from their anniversary sale 😅 Difficult to make bookings though since it's a small class. Need some camping skills.. 🙃",2023-01-03
"I thought that this was going to be a basic boring class where there was no support. I have never been so happy to be proven wrong! GREAT vibes, teachers with amazing energy and awesome song choices & facilities. I started with trial classes and i've been consistently going week after week.",2023-01-08
"Bought a trial pass and DO NOT recommend anyone to buy, unless you are willing to camp at their site and end up not getting any class slots.Booking system is horrible and almost impossible to book classes, they've sold too many trial passes and their studios just cannot handle the volume.",2023-01-07
I like the studio and amenities provided at Centrepoint. Lessons are pretty engaging as instructors will switch things up a bit as we practise movements between classical and contemporary movements.The only criticism here is the capability of your APP to handle surges.,2023-01-05
Reach just in time before class and to my dismay slot given away. Didn’t know they can do such thing when I have booked the slot and to begin with I am not even late. It’s really disappointing 😔 and not to mention the booking system which is another disaster.,2023-01-02
My first pilate class in life was freakin amazing thanks to Absolute You. The environment and facilities are great. Instructor was clear although it’s a little bit fast for beginners but she’s quick to help out for better understanding. Overall just love it!,2023-01-06
I brought the package on November 11.11 Sales. But I couldn't book for one one class at all. The system always put me to waiting list and the worst part is they never get me to the class for once. I will never go to this place anymore. Is a bad experience.,2023-01-07
"Very rude and bad services. Totally ignore my enquiry and did not respond. Always unable to reach their HOTline. Difficult to book their classes till my package expired! Money wasted. If u have too much money, join at ur own risk. Pls refund me my money!",2023-01-01
Addicted right from the first spin class. The front desk staffs made me feel welcomed from the moment I step into the studio. The instructors music and high energy make the tough workout feel more like a party and make me keep coming back for more.,2023-01-04
Fun and cool place to energise ur body to spin out ur calories and hype on ur mood with the professional fun loving instructors whom are attentive to every riders and never fails to give motivational quotes that we can push ourselves abit more .,2023-01-07
Scam! Don’t purchase any packages or trial classes! They will just take your money and you are not able to book any class. Only few slots for you to fight like dogs. Always no slot and the customer service is terrible. Will give 0 star if I can,2023-01-07
Being going for classes for almost 1yr and still enjoy it as much. The instructors are all very friendly and helpful. Totally enjoy the jumpboard Pilates. Hopefully they can increase to more classes as it’s really hard to book for a class.,2023-01-05

Started off with absolute on classpass and subsequently became an absolute package holder! Guess that should tell how much i enjoy classes with absolute :) The instructors are all super friendly and same goes for the front counter staff!,2023-01-08
Do not purchase a package for this studio!!! They do not have the capacity to service their members with classes and it is impossible to reserve a spot for class. Your package will expire before you’re able to secure a single class.,2023-01-07
"Favourite spin studio in Singapore! Love the energy, vibes and rhythm cycling classes. Instructors are professional and always motivating. Clean and big showers, which is so important. Towels and spinning shoes are provided.",2023-01-05
It’s a nice studio but it’s extremely difficult always to get a spot even with a package...they cancel classes and let you know once you have arrived or teachers arrive 20-30 minutes late to class and it seems to be normal,2023-01-07
