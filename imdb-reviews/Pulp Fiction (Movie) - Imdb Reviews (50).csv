"Apr 29, 2024",5,"Pulp Fiction rules. It is one of the pinnacles of cinema. But for all the people who like to spoil the fun by asking the question why, here's why: excellent performances (especially Samuel L. Jackson & John Travolta as a pair of hit men), fun characters and possibly the greatest screenplay of all time. For anyone who hasn't seen Pulp Fiction, watch it. For those who have seen it, watch it again and revisit Butch, Jules, Vincent, Mia, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. Thank you, Quentin.Relive one of the greatest films of all time 10/10. Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Frequent Language, Strong Drug Use and Some Very Disturbing Sexual Content."
"Apr 18, 2023",4,Every Terintino film I've ever seen has been awesome. This is no exception. The movie is so good and just interesting he has like four stories and ends up connecting every single one. The movie is super intense at parts and then really funny at others. The part where Sam L. Jackson takes that guys big kahuna burger and is questioning him is so tense since you know he isn't making it out alive. Also one my hands down favorite parts in a movie ever is when John Travolta's gun goes off in the car and he's just like ah man I just shot Marvin in the face like it was just a little slip up. The guys head exploded h=in his car! Anyway incredible movie definitely watch.Also if you didn't know there is a theory that was confirmed by Terintino That all his films are connected.
"Apr 18, 2023",4,"Well I had heard a lot about this movie earlier but after seeing it I can only say that it is a below average movie. I mean the only thing I enjoyed was some dialogs (although most of them were out of context)and nice editing job.But the story ,if there was one was plain boring .Acting was OK except Samuel who was great. I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke. Also Bruce Willis part was half baked and had very little significance for the story.So overall this movie which is a ""so called classic"" disappoints because bits of comedy like the Bonnie situation are not enough to make a movie classic."
"Mar 17, 2023",3,"Tarantino might not be the best actor in the world and a lot of people just don't like him and his movies full stop but I really do think he has created a master piece when it comes to pulp fiction and if you ever get the chance to watch it in a movie theater take that opportunity with both hands.I think the real reason Tarantino has been able to make such a classic movie is because he is a film fan and only a film fan could have ever put together the pulp fiction movie and made it work, I watched pulp fiction on my 50"" plasma screen last weekend probably for the 20th time and it has everything, gangsters, hit men, drugs, comedy, extreme violence but most of all it has ""COOL"" this is the movie that makes you feel like smoking or giving up your day job and being someone more interesting...in reality cool is not very cool at all and you most likely end up dead but as far as movies go this is cool."
"Mar 10, 2023",3,"Pulp Fiction put non-linear out-of-order films on the map. With all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to see one that's essentially a puzzle you have to piece together. Each of the characters have some way of bumping into each other. As a departure from the grave tone of his first film, the indie hit Reservoir Dogs, this started Tarantino's signature style of excessively gory dark comedies with humorous observational dialogue. This film is bizarre, has some tense frantic moments, will make you laugh and is overall unlike any other film out there. It's biggest advantage, aside from Samuel Jackson and John Travolta having philosophical discussions about hamburgers, is the fact that it's volatile and it's completely impossible to predict what's next. This was a benchmark movie and, in some ways, a paradigm shift for the industry."
"Mar 4, 2023",3,"Well, it's a movie of all movies. You can watch it many times and not get bored. There will be always a number of people who won't like it but so what... I love it even though I felt like it's not mine in the first time, but later ""Fiction"" became one of my favorites."
"Mar 2, 2023",3,"Pulp Fiction is often considered the coolest and greatest film of all time. But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isn't.First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they don't.Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isn't a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess."
"Feb 25, 2023",8,"This is an absolutely amazing film. Great story. Great characters. The layout of the film is truly amazing and goes against the classical 3 stage story, almost as if it is 4 short films with multiple separate protagonists and antagonists. It breaks the norm of movie story telling and that's why it is so highly renowned in the movie industry. Definitely would recommend."
"Aug 29, 2022",7,"This is, in my opinion, the most over-rated film of all time. Sure, there is some snappy dialogue here and there, and Tarantino has a good ear for music, but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie, nor the godlike status bestowed upon Tarantino himself.It's over-stylised, over-loud, over-acted, (sorry Samuel, Tim, John, Uma & Bruce) and the non-linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesn't work.But it's fashionable, so it's popular.By the way, this is one of the few films where I've actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end, so I guess I'm not the only one who didn't like it."
"Aug 16, 2022",6,A True test of how great a movie is .. is how well it. Still plays almost 30 years later ... well done. Quentin. And 30 years from now Django will too. Thanks for all of your movies.
"Jul 31, 2022",9,"Rather than dwell on any bad points - are their any? I must have watched & tremendously enjoyed this film 6x in the last year!! and probably the equivalent every year since it was released.Tarantino's mark on all his films is evident - and yes it's obvious he's using his childhood experience or dreams? in his fantastic ability to make stunning films.& to top it off the 360 filming of this piece is a pleasure to behold? Never ever get bored of the quality this artist delivers, nor do my 16 & 18 year old sons.One of the best Directors & Writers ever!"
"May 23, 2022",3,"Eh. Its alright. Overrated, i really dont want to type 150 characters please dont make me why are yyou making me do this please stop oh god i dont want to do this i just want to checklist this off the account thing it told me to write a review please stop it."
"Mar 11, 2021",2,"""What a unwasted long movie, terrific perfomance by all of the cast including Mr. Tarantino himself i think he is a great actor here, the story no doubt it's brilliant, and of course i will never stop writing this but the music that Tarantino choose is always perfect, i really enjoyed this, don't worry about the duration just enjoyed the whole story, Pulp Fiction is a movie that no matter how many you watch this movie even till like a thousand times it will always and forever be good, i highly recommended"""
"Mar 8, 2021",2,From the moment the movie starts it is captivating. with its non-linear story structure allows you to jump into your favorite scene and or watch the scenes in the order in which you feel is best.
"Mar 7, 2021",2,"While smoking, sex, nudity, violence, frightning/intense scenes are a main theme in Pulp Fiction, but it is good. Why? I have not seen the movie, but yet again I will know it will be awesome! A must-watch and recommendation!!!"
"Mar 4, 2021",2,"It is a good movie, Action packed and interesting use of time. If you like Fight Club you will like Pulp fiction. I found the acting to be well done with an amazing performance from Samuel L. Jackson, and John Travolta. This movie can be comic and sad at the same time and contains very many different view points about how life works. I found that this movie is not at all rated for children and should be avoided by those who are easily offended or have weak stomachs. Drug use is prevalent in this movie. I am very pleased with the overall final result, great flick. I recently had to pick my top five movies of all time that I enjoyed and this made the list, following Fight Club and many great films to the same strength and fortitude."
"May 29, 2020",2,"Maybe I'm just stupid, maybe I just have bad taste but this movie didn't fully click with me. And I don't think it's the masterpiece that a lot people make it out to be. I definitely don't think it's bad maybe it's just not my cup of tea. I walked away and took away a whole lot of nothing I'm sitting here trying to think of maybe what was the big thing that I'm supposed to leave the movie with like the message or even just what it wanted to say and to be honest idk it was just a lot of stuff. A lot cool stuff and stuff I enjoyed watching. I just don't get it. Maybe I'm supposed to rewatch it and I'll get it then but that in it of it self takes away some points for me cause I should at least have something the first time around something more to motivate me to watch it again then just confusion cause tbh as I said I just don't get it.Now I just read some stuff explaining what the movie was trying to do more. Tbh I think it's cool and all what it's trying to do sure but it's just so confusing and sure movies that make you think are cool but at least for me it's trying to make you think too much. Like I think it's cool and all but when I'm going to watch a movie I don't wanna have to leave needing to read some explainer articles like i don't wanna have to be a massive film buff to enjoy a movie I should be able to enjoy it whether I know a lot about movies or not."
"Apr 17, 2020",4,"There is just so much to say about this movie that I don't know where to start! I had no idea what I was ""in for"" when I went to see this movie.  I really hadn't seen the previews for it, and had read nothing about it at all. Usually, this is the best way for me to go into a movie...otherwise I have too many expectations.  Well, even if I *had* known something about Pulp, I don't think I would have expected what I got.  Not that I'm complaining.Pulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride wherever Tarantino feels like taking you.  And what a thrilling ride it is!  From the opening scene we're left scratching our heads wondering exactly where Quentin is going to lead us on this one.  Is it another Natural Born Killers?  Another Reservoir Dogs?  Although there are nods to his other films, as well as several others, Pulp Fiction stands on its own.  From shocking to downright hysterical...this movie has it all.  Samuel Jackson is incredible (although I'm quite partial to him anyway) as the Bible quoting Jules.  John Travolta is tremendous as Vincent and is purely delightful to watch as the story unfolds.  The cast could not have been more perfect and Tarantino brings the best out in each and every one of the actors and actresses.Is there excessive use of the ""f word""?  Well, sure.  But c'mon!  We're talking about ""gangsters"" here (not to mention the 20th century)...for reality sake the ""f word"" really has become a part of everyday language for many people.  Aside from that, it *is* a Tarantino film and, well, he's not exactly known for being a prude.Glorifying violence and drug use...   Oh boy, don't even get me started. The LAST impression I got from this movie was some sort of message stating: ""it's ok to do drugs and kill people"".  Ummm, no.  Ok ok, so there may be teenagers who see this, you say.  Well then here we go on the ""it's the movies fault that there are problems..."" tangent.  I'm not even going into that one.  Bottom line regarding the drug use and violence:  if you are *that* impressionable, you probably shouldn't be watching anything beyond a G-rated Disney movie...and even that is questionable.All in all, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic film.  With its fabulous acting, perfectly cast crew, and hilarious moments, Pulp is one thrill after another.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to see it for what it is and can focus on the movie...not the bits and pieces taken waaaay out of context.  10 out of 10 stars."
"Apr 3, 2020",5,"What a great movie. Deserves all of the praise it gets. I might be saying this because I am a dude but this is one of the best movies of all time. Wonderfully paced, classic scenes, classic lines, and great performances from Jackson, Travolta, Thurman, Keitel, Rhames, Willis and not such a great performance from Tarantino. My favorite chapter has to be the Bonnie Situation purely because of Harvey Keitel as the Wolf."
"Feb 25, 2020",8,"I can't see what people see in this movie. I did not like it because it is violent for violence's sake and unless you think that is funny, it is not interesting. Another movie from Quentin Tarantino that is just crude. Pulp says it all. The writing is clever. I won't deny that. The cast is good. What a waste of talent. To put a movie like this on a pedestal is a sad commentary on our times. It is hard to identify most of the characters unless you are a criminal type. It seams in order to make a ""GREAT"" movie all you have to do is put as much violence, sex and the F word as you can and people will laud you. There is no redeeming value in this movie."
"Oct 22, 2019",10,"This film has been picked over by critics, film students and general enthusiasts of the cinema since it's premier in October of 1994 and there's always so much to say about it. It remains one of the most off the wall, cult style films with such genuine and unforgettable personality.The premise of the movie spans a course of two days, which in reality feels more like a week and involve a hardy cast of characters, more notably the main characters: Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel Jackson) Marsellus Wallace and Mia Wallace (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). A series of crimes that intertwine the fates and connects all of these characters, has the flow of the film sending you back and forth through time in order to understand their involvement with each other. This gives the editing of the film such an original feel that has defined Director Quentin Tarantino's style as a filmmaker and given him such a massive following.The theme of the film is certainly crime and how it almost never pays, at least not for you. All of these characters find themselves on a crossroad of sorts, having to make drastic decisions that center around their involvement in criminal activities, whether it be robbing some college students or disposing of a body. Some take the higher road and find their salvation, while others fade out without ever taking the chance. The tone has an element of silliness to it but ultimately keeps its serious tone about gangsters doing gangster things.The dialog and writing as a whole remain this film's greatest strength as it allows the characters to become so much more believable and charismatic. Tarantino has always had an extraordinary talent for dialog and the voice he gives his characters, which you will see in any of his films (I recommend Kill Bill for this reason). The quotability of Pulp fiction is something else that any cinema fan has certainly noticed as the film has some of the more memorable lines from any of Tarantino's pictures up to that point. Being so entertained simply by spoken words is a solid sign of talented writing, a talent which Tarantino does not lack.The tone and style of Pulp fiction would inspire so many low budget and or indie films to come as well as a number of feature films, though it holds a specifically special place in cult film culture. This film will certainly remain a classic for any movie lover and a special film to share with newfound movie buffs."
"May 19, 2016",1,"I'm not an expert in cinema but I find this film exeptional because of its characters, of its script and its dialog. Honestly I can watch this film all day and I will still find it insane. But do you really need my opinion to watch it ? Go watch it immediatly if you didn't"
"May 13, 2016",1,"Relatively close to the beginning of my deep-dive into cinema - you know, writing reviews and all - Quentin Tarantino managed to become one of my favorites almost instantly. Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained - all of these really blew me away, and even when watching some of his still-popular-but-not-as-much films, he never missed for me. Needless to say that for several years now I've been wanting to watch this movie, but I haven't, because I wanted to make my way towards it up the IMDb poster. And well, look at that. Here we are, on the second feature we're watching from the top 10. Let's get to it.Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's second film, and it's honestly quite a tough one to explain, plot-wise, without getting into spoilers. Let's try to approach it like this: Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) is a ruthless, cold-blooded mafia boss. Throughout the film we have three stories, each of them related to his shady business. Our three main characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) - a smooth, charming agent under Wallace, Butch (Bruce Willis) - a boxer who has made a dangerous deal with Wallace, and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) - a theatrical, dramatic agent of Wallace who operates alongside Vincent in some of their tasks. Three characters, three interconnected stories.When people think of cool cinema, many of them think of Tarantino, and especially this movie. Tarantino has his way with cool writing, he sure does. Every movie of his I've seen had at least several moments that were really memorable and badass. I wouldn't say that this movie per se is where it shows most - maybe he's still trying too hard, at times, here, considering it's a rather early movie of his, developed from early ideas- but generally, yeah, this movie has some moments that will definitely make you appreciate Tarantino's badass-ness. Something about the casualness of all the violence here (like the old comedy song says, cool guys don't look at explosions) has both comical and awesome nature.The dialogue here plays into this idea of being nonchalantly violent and in danger - characters in life threatening situations can talk about foot massages or coffee like it's nothing. It creates some iconic moments for sure, and this movie is indeed very quotable. Only two significant characters here are poorly written, in my opinion: Winston Wolf and Mia Wallace. Without getting into spoiler territory, I'll just say that the actors (Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman) can do so much better, and pity that they weren't given characters that are fuller, less amateurish.Talking about rough-around-the-edges: the term ""pulp fiction"" refers to books that were provocative, full of sex and violence, but also not so good - only made to sell and entertain. Despite this movie being good, I think that the title does fit it. Just look at the poster - it's like a cover for a book that's supposed to lure you in, stories that teenagers will read and hide because they're supposed to only be for adults. The short-story structure, the general violence and crudeness, how it tries to appeal to guys more than to gals. In the end of the day, it is what it is - a fun film, an entertaining one, but far from being a life altering experience for me.The soundtrack is great, as always. Tarantino has some of the most iconic soundtracks out there, and not only because he picks good songs, but because he knows how to make it fit to the scene perfectly. Usually they have some cool subtext, and they just turn the iconic-meter up almost every time. Always memorable soundtracks.The structure of this movie is unusual, and it's definitely one of the things that it's famous for. It's a cool idea, and though it disturbs the momentum of the movie a little bit it's nothing serious. I do feel like it makes everything a little messier, less consistent, but it's not necessarily a bad thing - this is sort of the point, and I can appreciate that, for better or worse. I also feel like the gold watch story was better than the other ones, btw, but it's not that big of a gap in quality.To sum it up: Pulp Fiction fits its title very, very well - just like a pulp magazine, this movie is a little rough around the edges, but fun and entertaining nonetheless. From the classic poster to the dialogue - everything is screaming violent, crude, hot pulp fiction, and I kinda like it overall, despite (any maybe also because of) its roughness. Feeling a 7.6/10 on this one."
"May 13, 2016",1,"""Pulp Fiction"" has two things going for it; Sam Jackson(robbed at the Oscars) and Christopher Walken(who has the film's funniest sequence. But that's all. The Tim Roth/Amanda Plummer scenes are irritating and too profane(swearing's great, but not like this). The Bruce Willis ""Gimp"" scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know the one) is absolutely unbearable. She and Travolta(too fat to dance and never a terrific actor) almost ruin this 1994 Tarantino film single handedly. But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, it's excessive, the way the three stories are told is confusing, and...that's about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as Marsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me. I know many like Tarantino, but I think he's a show-off in the grand tradition of John Woo(one of his heroes apparently)."
"May 12, 2016",1,"Well, I finally saw 'Pulp Fiction'. Hadn't after all this time, but I've heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented it.UGH.I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didn't appreciate the 'art' of this film, or its 'brilliance', or any 'statement' it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em."
"May 12, 2016",1,"A movie with no real solid plot, Pulp Fiction launches you smack dab in the middle of the happenings and the inter-connectedness of a group of characters. Structured unusually and executed freely, the movie is deliciously cliched and groundbreaking all at once. It offers a careless normalcy to violence and crime and expresses this through the sickly humor. Tarantino becomes the master of creating so much with so little, which is especially evident in the pointless yet captivating dialogue, and with the drawn out but mesmerizing shot composition. It's over the top but hell that's the fun of it all."
"Feb 25, 2016",8,"Plenty of people love this movie. They rave about how original, cool and funny it is. I will admit that there is a lot to see in Avary and Tarantino's script including plenty of off beat cameo roles. I really liked Samuel Jackson's character. Not only was the performance excellent but the depth of what he was dealing with was very powerful. The rest of the movie I wasn't so happy with. Pulp Fiction has some original story ideas. But if you compare it to Goodfellas which also has flashbacks, slow motion and sick humor it doesn't look that original. But I will admit that the story in Pulp Fiction is done in a somewhat original way. Moving down from here we have the Bruce Willis role. It is very powerful but so graphically violent that like Blue Velvet it becomes too much after a while. Down from here we have Uma Thurman's part which I felt was filling time. I didn't think that much of Travolta either. As for the so called great humor, I did not laugh at the scene in the car which just about tells the story for me. Finally about Tarantino. If he is going to have a great career in this business, he will need to write dialogue in which every other line doesn't have the ""N"" word and also where the climax of each scene isn't filled with buckets of blood. Without the shock value I wonder if he is that good. I thought Jackie Brown was only a little above average but better than Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction presents a few effective, original moments and has a great performance by Samuel Jackson. Otherwise it piles on the violence, blood and racial slurs hoping to shock but turning out just to be overdone."
"Oct 22, 2015",10,i love this movie but can somebody please tell me what is in the briefcase. John travolta and samuel jackson give the best performances of thier careers.  Also Quentin makes one of the best films of our time.  A movie that should be seen by all.
"Aug 30, 2014",7,Most plot twisting movie you'll ever watch. All these meaningless scenes come to a twisting great climax that'll blow your mind. Iconic performance by the legendary (Samuel L. Jackson) and (John Travolta).
"Jul 31, 2014",9,"... Let's clear one thing up first: I happen to believe that this movie is not as good as ""Reservoir Dogs"". ""RD"" had a clearly defined story and aim. I'm not so sure this does. It feels more like an exercise by Mr Tarantino, demonstrating just how audacious he can be. Is there anything wrong with such flashiness when the result is this entertaining? Not in the slightest.""The Gold Watch"" segment did nothing for me, and in my opinion should have been left out of the final cut, much as I like Christopher Walken. The rest of the movie without exception is a tour de force of controlled direction (Tarantino always knows where the film is going, even if his audience doesn't) understated but powerful acting, and moments of bizarre humour. I could quote the dialogue verbatim here, but there is simply too much quality and not enough space.This was also Sam Jackson's breakout role. For that we should be thankful, because the man is 'star quality' personified...No amount of superlatives can come close to encapsulating the feeling that most of you will get when watching the movie for the first time. It is an absorbing experience, almost like you have stepped into a much cooler VR sim of real life. Repeated viewings do not seem to dull its stark vitality.Those of you who abhor it for its casual attitude to violence miss out on its good points that DO NOT contain violence; namely, realistic yet captivating dialogue, flawless character development and bravura directing. It is much more than the glorification of gangsters and their subculture, a la ""Lock, Stock... "" and its ilk.Calling it the best movie ever made is hollow and unsubstantiated praise that I will not garner it with. One thing that can not be denied is that from its arrival it changed our perceptions of what cinema can mean to all people.Despite this, as I said, I don't think it can compare equally with ""Reservoir Dogs""..."
"Jul 30, 2013",9,"I have no idea where to start! This is my first post so I thought it appropriate to write about my favourite movie. First of all, the cast. The cast is what drew me to it in the first place, with Samuel L Jackson who is one of my favourite actors and Bruce Willis who is also in my top five, and I believe the biggest tragedy about this movie is that these two fantastic actors did not spend any time together on screen. Other greats (in my opinion) in this film are of course John Travolta and Uma Thurman. I have recently seen Swordfish in which travolta gave an incredibly strong performance as he does in Pulp Fiction, and Uma Thurman who I have admittedly not seen in anything else but also delivers a powerful performance. Leaving the cast aside, the storyline of course is pure genius. Another Tarantino classic with shooting, swearing, quoting from the bible, taking drugs, dancing and Samuel L Jackson shouting a lot, it has all the elements that make a great film."
"Oct 21, 2012",10,"I have seen Pulp Fiction 10 years after its release !! Of course , Thats because of the rating of IMDB .. IMDB is my # 1 resource of good movies based on the ratings in.. I would definitely go for the rating above 8 or above 7.5..While I would consider the movies below 7 .. !!Any ways , Back to the movie ..It was a very nice movie .. but I would just give it 7.5 out of 10 .. Good Cast .. It is worth watching .. !! ..."
"Aug 16, 2008",6,"I watched this cult classic on 1st january,2022 for the very first time and it still feels fresh!! Maybe that is the real magic about this movie. I know some people might call it ""overrated"", well I am not saying it is a masterpiece but it did entertain me a lot. Sometimes movie are all about entertainment. If someone wants to sit down in front of a tv after a exhausted day and wants to watch something to lighten his mood , then this is a perfect movie for you my friend .This movie is technically good too. The way Tarantino wrote a clever script and tied his audience with a movie with such an ordinary story, is really impressive . The acting, humor, violence and use of music is top notch. And last but not the least Uma Thurman ,THE BEAUTY!!!!"
"Feb 25, 2008",8,"Pulp Fiction was one of the greatest films of last century; Tarantino intertwines the story six main characters in an original tale of redemption. The iconic opening conversation about what they call fast-food abroad, between the two mob men, Vincent and Jules, sets a trend of witty dialogue and black comedy throughout the film. Vince (Travolta) seems to be the most thuggish of the pair who clearly enjoys his brutal job, where as Jules (Samuel Jackson) comes across as the more virtuous, spitting out memorable biblical quotes throughout the film. The layered masterpiece must be watched again and again to enjoy its full potential. With a simple yet uniquely assembled plot this film plays host to a string of great characters that will never be beaten, nor will there ever be a film quite like it."
"Aug 28, 2006",7,"I have seen this movie more than 15 times and still havent gotten tired of it. That is something, isn't it? Actually, I think, it is a great combination of great actors and great screenplay that makes the movie that good. Oh ... great music too! In short, this is my favorite one and I advise anyone to watch it too."
"Aug 17, 2006",6,"This film has everthing, in perfect balances - drama, humor, violence, wisdom, love; it has wonderful dialog and interesting characters. I can play this DVD 24 hours a day, the episodic nature of the movie is such that you can watch part of it one day then watch other parts at other times without feeling you missed key plot points.I wish every writer and director took the effort to carefully sculpt and craft every aspect of a movie like Tarantino does."
"Aug 29, 2004",7,"I have lost count of the amount of time I have watched this film. I enjoy watching all of Quentin Tarantino's films but this has to be one of my favourite. There is plenty of action and bad language, they just don't make films like this anymore. Tarantino's films have garnered both critical and commercial success. He has received many industry awards, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two BAFTA Awards and the Palme d'Or, and has been nominated for an Emmy and a Grammy. He was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time in 2005,[4] and filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich has called him ""the single most influential director of his generation"
"Aug 18, 2004",6,"Cinema is not like rock and roll, but once or twice in a generation someone will come along and try to reinvent cool for the screen. In our generation, just such a personage is Quentin Tarantino, a writer-director who raised the snappy, witty dialogue of the gangster genre to the level a cunning art. Pulp Fiction is arguably his signature movie.It has a screenplay of perfect construction, full of symbolism and tiny elements that play off one another throughout the two-and-a-half hour runtime. As with Tarantino's debut, Reservoir Dogs, the dialogue is a continual complement to the action, in contrast to cinema's usual actions-over-words ethos. There are actually often more words then are strictly needed, for the sake of rhythm or emphasis, such as Uma Thurman saying ""five, as in there's 1-2-3-4-5 of us"". One of the best things about the Pulp Fiction screenplay is that, though ostensibly a gangster movie, it's also very much not. There is much of the mundane aspects of criminality, such as Lance asking his wife for baggies and twisticks, and the irony of hoods relying upon a cleaner and an underworld medic for things they got up to when off-duty, as it were.Tarantino's style as a visual director is, for the most part, beautifully simple. In an era where edits seem to come every two seconds, Pulp Fiction features some refreshingly long takes. It's a very minimalist style – he doesn't show us anything we don't really need to see. During the Kahuna burger exchange, he breaks it down to just two opposing but contrasting shots, a close-up of Samuel L. Jackson and the mid-shot of Brad with Jackson and Travolta before and behind him. Some scenes open with just a series of close-ups, and for much of the movie, sets and scenery are barely noticeable. This puts the focus totally on the actors, something that is all too often forgotten in the more showy, technical movies of the modern age. That's not to say backgrounds never matter. Once in a while there is a brilliant something-or-other to be noticed, like the game of Operation in Lance's house, standing out amid the dull-coloured bric-a-brac for a second or two.The reams of dialogue and this attention given to actors puts a burden on the cast that has similarities to that in a stage play. And as with classic stage acting the performances here are certainly exaggerated, a kind of heightened version of reality, albeit a world away from theatrical hamming. Uma Thurman particularly stands out, sparkling with energy and delight, and a flirtatious frisson with an also-impressive John Travolta. Michael Madsen was the original choice for the role, but Travolta has a somewhat softer approach that is just right. Finest of all though is surely Samuel L. Jackson, who has this brilliantly menacing stillness, contrasting with a rhythmic, shifting tone in his words. Jackson is to Tarantino what Laurence Olivier is to Shakespeare; he can speak the lines as if he's actually thinking them.My only problem with Pulp Fiction is it's sometimes too clever for its own good, filled with too many embellishments, too many attempts to be outstanding and different. There are some moments that just seem almost twee in a way, like when Thurman's ""square"" is literally drawn on the screen. But by-and-large Pulp Fiction is a work of much filmmaking genius, and it's hardly surprising that creativity as vibrant as this will come bubbling through the seams here and there."
"Apr 18, 2004",4,"So I've been a fan of Pulp Fiction since I was in High School. I watched the movie last night for the first time in awhile and was struck by never really knowing what was in the brief case, so I watched the scene in great detail. I noticed the apartment number was #416. So thinking this is probable related to a bible verse I looked up one starting with Matthew 4:16. I don't read the bible often if ever but since the Movie has the lighting up brief case locked at 666, and Jules set for a path of salvation on seriously changing his ways from a gangster to walking the earth in the path of the Shepard I thought to look it up. So Matthew 4:16 reads ""the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."" I think this relates to the brief case, the people who had it, to Vincent which stayed in the land of the dark and ended up dead, and to Jules which turned to ""the path of the Shepard"" as he says. A great light was shone to Jules (which was currently living in the land of the dark) after the bullets whizzed by him and a light dawned as it did for all the others in the room which where also all living in the land of the shadow of death. Just a theory but better than anything else I've looked through yet."
"Apr 3, 2004",5,"Pinnacle direction. Pinnacle screenplay. Pinnacle acting. Pinnacle cinema.These days you rarely get to see anything original, movies now-a-days have become so cliche and so predictable at an unprecedented level.Released in the 90s, when the world wasn't this 'woke' and sensitive - The Golden Age of cinema.This movie teaches a valuable life lesson - choices matter, your life isn't pre-decided and it's in your hands. It highlights vengeance, forgiveness and even love in a way which you've never experienced before.People who can't get their head around this masterpiece are the real culprits of the degrading cinema these days. Hollywood is just matching with their viewers' viewing level. This is what I believe."
"Aug 3, 2003",7,I love this movie i can quote lines from so many parts lol i love how every ones story kinda mixes and the Easter eggs of of movies is just great if your a fan of the director! Really entertaining keeps your attention thats for sure.
"Apr 18, 2003",4,"Pulp Fiction is a real boom in action movies,unique style of Quentin Tarantino made this movie what it really is-a legend!Of course let´s not forget the great business that the actors did.Even now,after  9 years I like to watch it.It´s a first class movie for sure!"
"Apr 3, 2003",5,"One of the most over rated movies ever. This is a good movie don't get me wrong but people chalk it up to be a masterpiece of film and the best thing ever since the wheel, and i don't see eye to eye with those people sure it's cool, sure it's got good dialogue but there's a lot of awkward scenes that go on for to long. And i was not happy with the ending it was bad and not fun but i digress. My one complaint was to be left more impacted then when i came and what i saw was wild and wacky but when i left i feel like i just saw a movie that had all those cool things but not enough things to care about."
"Feb 25, 2003",8,"A great film from a great Director. the film is filled with dialogues that have diverged into catch phrases. A game of actors at a high level, one of the best movies for John Travolta."
"Oct 23, 2002",10,"I like the soundtrack of this movie. I wish I watched this movie back in 70's when I was working hard in Japan. This could change your mind to see the things. I also like this director's other films. They are all worth watching and the soundtracks are also great, for sure.I like the soundtrack of this movie.

"Oct 22, 2002",10,"Regardless of what great actors and actresses were in this movie, I found it to be very repulsive.  The dungeon scene was something that should have been shown on Mississippi burning only they had the decency not to go there. All in all this movie was difficult to follow and I consider myself an intelligent person.  Violence and filthy language taken to an extreme is how I would characterize this one."
"Aug 18, 2002",6,"For those who appreciate great films, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a must see. The movie is Tarantino's 2nd work after having great success with his gangster story of ""Reservoir Dogs"". There are many unique aspects of Pulp Fiction that make it so good. As many of you know, Tarantino's use of dialogue that he gives the characters in his films is excellent, humorous, and intelligent. Pulp Fiction is by far his best in this aspect. From conversations talking about foot massages to talking about filthy animals; PF has the best dialogue of any movie I have ever seen. The movie is shuffled in a way that it tells the story out of sequence, once again a redundant aspect in most Tarantino films. This influenced many different mob films, but no other movie will ever be as great as Pulp Fiction. Film making at its finest.$$$"
"Apr 3, 2002",5,"I never thought it'd happen. I've seen a lot of movies. I've given a lot of high ratings. I've never before seen fit to give a movie a ten, though. But I could find not a single thing wrong with this movie.I avoided Quentin Tarantino's movies ever since I saw my first one, which was Kill Bill. I thought it was appalling - the storyline has been done before, the violence was over the top, the gore was stupid, the acting was shocking, and we won't even go into my dislike for Uma Thurman here. I was persuaded to watch both this movie and Reservoir Dogs by my best mate, and after much reluctance I finally acquiesced. And thank all the Gods I did.This manages to be one of the most violent, brutal movies ever produced. However, in a complete paradox to the statement I just made, there is next to no violence in the movie - it runs, much like Reservoir Dogs (but not to the same extent) off the witty and intelligent dialogue, and the incredible acting displayed by everyone involved. And yes, this includes Uma Thurman, despite my hatred for her - I regard her as a terrible actress, whatever beauty she may hold (and let's face it, there ain't much) and I refuse to watch most movies she stars in. She played a small role in this movie, and for once she actually played it well. I extend a hearty salutation.I must give a hearty thumbs up to John Travolta at this point. His character, Vincent Vega, is easily the best I have ever seen him play. Whilst he is a criminal, a junkie, a torturer and a murder, he manages to be extremely likable and you can't help sometimes but wish you were him.To those people who dislike intelligent movies - I advise you against watching this movie. The film grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go until the entire 114 minutes have expired, but if you're possessed of a lower IQ then by the end you won't have much of an idea of what's gone on.The film is constructed in Tarantino's trademark nonlinear fashion, meaning that if you want to watch this movie you haver to do so in one sitting to understand it. you can't just watch bits and pieces of it, otherwise it will make no sense to you whatsoever.I have regained a previously nonexistent respect for Mr. Tarantino with this film, and I look forward to perusing his works in more detail later on.""Get the Gimp!"""
"Jul 31, 1998",9,"This is a great movie, i loved it. 10/10. Tarantino rules and i love Uma. This should have won Oscars everythings great loved it do more pals. (insert Fall Out Boy's Uma Thurman lyrics here). That part where Uma dances is great. I like her a lot. Yeah thats all i have to say. I just wanted to have all the things done in my profile thats why this review sucks. Just Waco the damn movie please. I HAVE TO WRITE SO MUCH!? WHY? I just want all the things done in my profile. I hope you are going to see this movie. Like its really good. Im serious when i say that I'm so sick of this. But, on the movie, its awesome, great, dope, cool, amazing..."
"Jul 30, 1998",9,"So this movie contains the best acting roles in the respective careers of John Travolta, Samluel Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis. On top of that, and maybe in support of that, it has the best dialog ever seen in a movie.What more do people want? This is a masterpiece, in a totally different category than anything Tarrantino released before or after.And people who don't like excessive violence, more than 10.000 people are shot to death each year in the states. So really open your eyes, it is not like this comes from nothing. This movie is completely realistic in that aspect."
