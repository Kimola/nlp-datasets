15/01/2025,8,"This movie will change you, as some have commented. It will bring you to a disgusting low. Definitely skip it, or you'll be sorry you didn't.It's a sickening wretchingly vile voyueristic wannabe false glorification.Skip it. In fact be happy to skip it. Sometimes I think we have a big pile of juvenile retards on IMDb, that only hope to vote for any movie along the lines of it's inherent jerry springer qualities and the judgement comes as a message about how low and worthless it can get.This movie is not entertaining, it is not nice, it is not realistic, it is racist, degrading, and stupid.Don't waste your money, your time, or your life."
27/12/2024,8,Pulp Fiction is an amazing movie filled with great dialogue and violence. Highly recommend watching it no matter what genre you like. One of the best Tarantino films ever. Go watch it
07/12/2024,8,"Pulp fiction, the magnum opus of Quentin Tarantino, is an absolute visual treat. The exemplary usage of nonlinear story-telling will leave the viewers open mouthed. Backed up by some very powerful performances by the cast, the film has become a benchmark for all black comedy films.The screenplay by Tarantino artistically narrates the incidents concerning a particularly interesting group of people. The film is replete with iconic moments, like the monologue perfectly delivered by Jules Winnfield (Samuel Jackson), the twist dance routine of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and the Mexican standoff in a diner. However, this masterpiece is not recommended for the faint- hearted, as a lot of R - rated violent scenes of great detail are interspersed in the film.The soundtrack has been compiled quite tastefully. 'Misirlou' sets a funky tone for the film during the opening credits. Structurally, the film is divided into seven sequences, which have connected stories. As expected, the cameo from Tarantino himself as Jimmie, the distraught husband in arguably the most entertaining part of the film - The Bonnie situation - proves to be the cherry on the cake."
18/11/2024,10,"The movie that shot director Quentin Tarantino into popularity, pulp fiction still stands as his greatest movie and one of the best movies ever created.The film follows multiple inter-connecting plot lines: Samuel L Jackson and John Trovolta play two hit men searching for a stolen briefcase, Uma Thurman plays the boss mans wife out on a date with Trovolta, Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run from gangsters, ands Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple robbing a diner. The plot is structured brilliantly and is told out of order which makes things even more interesting.The film features most Tarantino trademarks, including his normal chunky dialogue, with some of the most quotable lines in any film ever contained here. The films also not shy on action and there's loads of surprises throughout the movie(although I wont spoil anything).Acting wise, pulp fiction features one of the greatest casts in film history. Jackson gives what is undoubtedly the best performance of his career as the bible spouting hit man, while Trovolta gives another great performance in the role that resurrected his career. Thurman also acts brilliantly as the sexy but mysterious wife to the main mafia boss. The supporting cast is strong with Harvey Keitel playing the gangster expert and even Tarantino himself has a small but hilarious role.But thats not the only reason PF is so great, its everything about it. The soundtrack is classic Tarantino with tons of pop culture tunes used to add to the story. While the camera work is some of the best since the films release. And the film just keeps on giving, from its smart opening scene which carries the whole movie, to its hilarious middle acts, to its hugely satisfying conclusion.As it stands, pulp fiction is still one of the funniest, darkest, most enjoyable and most creative films ever. If you haven't seen the film yet then I can't recommend enough you go out and watch it as soon as you can. A true classic."
29/10/2024,10,"When I watched pulp fiction for the first time I didn't like it since I didn't know what to expect
and I entirely focused only on the story-line but after a repeated view I just fell in love with this movie I ain't got mich to say about this film since everyone said about its originality,non linear story yelling and its masterful screenplay.All I can say is the movie is worth the love and the appreciation it got and it is one of the best movies ever made."
17/10/2024,10,"absolutely fantastic music, and directorial genius, anyone who thinks otherwise obviously did not understand it. Witty dialogue and intelligent storyline and definet for true movie lovers, fantastic script with impeccable timing and well acted, a truly incredible movie. an unpredictable storyline that will take the viewer by surprise, a twisted and juggled plot to leave you thinking about the movie. watching this movie will leave you wanting more of tarentino's writing and directorial work, ( see reservoir dogs, kill bill etc). this movie will make you think and is not for the faint hearted and does not involve any seedy special effect to draw attention away from this impeccably written story and nothing else to say except this movie deserves full marks in every category"
01/10/2024,10,This film is simply pure Art. Something to just watch and indulge in. It's one of those art pieces that never get boring. Tarantino refuses to show any flaws in this film. Cinema at it's peak.
30/09/2024,10,"Hands down some of the best acting and directing in this film! I love how it all came together, the editing matched the theme and some times made you confused about what was going on."
24/08/2024,7,"In a diner, a man and a woman who call each other Pumpkin and Honey Bunny eat breakfast in a booth. Honey Bunny teases Pumpkin for not wanting to commit armed robberies anymore, and Pumpkin explains that robbing the diner would be better than robbing convenience stores or banks. She agrees, and the two leap to their feet and draw their weapons, before the opening credits roll.Across town, two men in suits named Vincent and Jules ride in a car discussing Europe and fast food. Jules tells Vincent that Marsellus, their boss, allegedly had a man thrown off a balcony for massaging his wife Mia's feet, who Vincent has been instructed to take out to dinner. They argue about the implications of foot massages, before storming an apartment with three men inside. Jules kills one, and recites Ezekiel 25:17 before killing another, named Brett. Vincent retrieves a briefcase, the contents of which glow, from a kitchen cabinet.In a bar, Marsellus gives an envelope full of cash to a boxer named Butch, bribing him to throw his next match. Vincent and Jules, now wearing tee shirts, enter the bar, and Butch has a brief exchange with Vincent on his way out.
In the following scene, Vincent buys heroin from his drug dealer, named Lance, and talks briefly to his girlfriend Jody. After buying three grams of heroin, Vincent shoots up and heads to Mia's house. Mia does cocaine in the bathroom while Vincent fixes himself a drink. They head to a restaurant named Jackrabbit Slim's, where they talk about Mia's failed television pilot and the foot massage rumor, which Mia denies. Mia forces Vincent to participate in a twist contest, which they win.Back at Mia's house, while Vincent uses the bathroom, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine and snorts it, falling unconscious. A panicked Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, although Lance is reluctant to help. Vincent is able to successfully revive her with an adrenaline shot straight to the heart. At the end of the night, Mia tells Vincent a joke from her television pilot, which she previously refused to divulge, and the two agree to keep the night's events a secret.A man named Captain Koons visits Butch as a child, giving him a gold watch that is a family heirloom. As an adult, Butch kills his opponent in a boxing match, rather than purposely lose as Marsellus wanted. Butch escapes in a cab driven by a woman named Esmeralda, and calls a bookie named Scottie who plans to collect Butch's earnings. Meanwhile, Marsellus orders that Butch be killed. At a nearby motel, Butch's girlfriend Fabienne waits for him, and the two talk and have sex. The next morning, Butch realizes his gold watch is missing, and angrily leaves the motel in search of it.Butch cautiously returns to his apartment, and initially finds no one there. He retrieves the watch and notices a gun on the counter. He hears the toilet flush, and kills the man who emerges from the bathroom, which turns out to be Vincent. Butch leaves and is spotted by Marsellus at a stoplight. Butch rams him with his car, and an injured Marsellus chases an injured Butch until both men are subdued inside a nearby pawn shop by the owner, named Maynard.Butch and Marsellus awaken in the pawn shop basement, where Maynard has bound and gagged them. A man named Zed shows up, who orders Maynard to get ""the Gimp,"" a man in a full-body bondage suit who sleeps in a trunk. Zed drags Marsellus into another room to be raped while Maynard watches, and Butch manages to break free. Butch is about to flee when he hears Marsellus's cries and instead retrieves a katana sword and ambushes the men, killing Maynard. Now freed, Marsellus shoots Zed in the crotch, and tells Butch that the men are even, as long as Butch leaves town and never tells anyone about the incident. Butch rides Zed's chopper motorcycle back to the motel, and he and Fabienne ride away together.The film flashes back to the scene where Jules recites Ezekiel 25:17, this time from the perspective of an armed man hiding in the bathroom. After Jules kills Brett, the man runs out and fires wildly, miraculously missing Jules and Vincent with his entire clip. Jules and Vincent kill him, and Jules calls the event an act of ""divine intervention."" The two take Marvin, the only surviving man in the apartment, with them, and leave. In the car, the men continue debating ""divine intervention,"" and Jules pledges to give up his life of crime. Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, killing him. Jules calls a nearby friend named Jimmie, and they head to his house to deal with the cleanup.
At Jimmie's house, Jules calls Marsellus for help, who arranges for a man named Winston Wolfe to come over and help fix the situation. Jimmie tells the men they have ninety minutes before his wife Bonnie arrives home. Wolfe arrives ten minutes later and instructs Jules and Vincent to wipe down the car upholstery. They place Jimmie's blankets over the seat, and Wolfe hoses a naked Jules and Vincent down in the backyard, before giving them old tee shirts to wear. They follow Wolfe to a nearby auto shop, where the car is destroyed. Wolfe introduces Jules and Vincent to his girlfriend Raquel on his way out of the auto shop, and then leaves.Jules and Vincent decide to get breakfast at the same diner that Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are about to rob in the first scene. Vincent goes to the bathroom just before Pumpkin and Honey Bunny draw their guns. When Pumpkin demands Jules's wallet and the briefcase, Jules draws his weapon, and explains to Pumpkin that he now understands the true meaning of Ezekiel 25:17, and wants to find a non-violent solution. Vincent emerges from the bathroom, resulting in a Mexican standoff. Jules successfully de-escalates the situation, and he and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand."
07/08/2024,7,"Every movie has at least one person who doesn't like it just as every great movie has at least 1 person who does not enjoy the film, this film not the exception that proves the rule but rather a text book example.  Warning: not everyone will love this movie.  That aside, the rest of you will hold this movie next to such timeless classics as The Godfather Part I and The Usual Suspects, this isn't a ""One-hit Wonder,"" Quentin Tarantino has proven himself perhaps as the best director of our time, second to Francis Ford Coppola, maybe.  No, Pulp Fiction is a movie that doesn't rely on special effects or hype to sell as does many movies such as Lord of The Rings. This movie is real.  The monolog delivered by John Travolta in Swordfish applies to this movie: no moronic sentences, no bad acting, and a story seemingly flawless.  Yes this movie deserves to be compared to The Godfather Part I, and buy the DVD."
02/07/2024,9,"I thought it was a good movie though there's a lot of violence and drugs,but it doesn't wants to influence us to do drugs or killed people. I think its a moral that teaches us to prevent people,especially teens not to do drugs or be violent because of the consequences which in the movie we can realized what has happened."
23/06/2024,9,"I think Pulp Fiction is really misunderstood. Many friends don't like the movie, because they think it's too difficult. Pulp Fiction is one of Tarantino's best, but I still think Reservoir Dogs is a much better movie. But what I do like, is the fact that Tarantino always uses the same actors. They're all great! Think about it: Harvey Keitel (who played mr. White in Reservoir Dogs) , Uma Thurman (Batman & Robin), Ving Rhames (Mission:Impossible), Tim Roth (also Reservoir Dogs) ,... I just think it's fantastic! Go on and make many other movies like that, Quentin!!!"
16/06/2024,9,"Incredible film which I love in so many ways. From the quirky way several seemingly disjointed stories come together, the sarcastic humor, the gratuitous (but delectable) violence, and even the soundtrack. Samuel L. Jackson & Bruce Willis are both brilliant in a film which is more than just a must watch, but a most watch over and over addition to any film collection. 10 of 10!"
14/06/2024,9,"""Pulp Fiction"" panders to base behavior.The filth of the language,subject matter,including sodomy,sickening drug use & the flippancy of the hit men is not amusing.This movie is one of the worst pieces of trash ever pawned off as art!Glorification of this movie illuminates the level of moral turpitude that permeates throughout American society & Hollywood in particular."
12/06/2024,9,"It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments."
20/05/2024,4,"Pulp Fiction (1994) **** (out of 4) Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the ""real"" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that ""Bad Motherf&*&er,"" which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age."
29/04/2024,5,"Pulp Fiction rules. It is one of the pinnacles of cinema. But for all the people who like to spoil the fun by asking the question why, here's why: excellent performances (especially Samuel L. Jackson & John Travolta as a pair of hit men), fun characters and possibly the greatest screenplay of all time. For anyone who hasn't seen Pulp Fiction, watch it. For those who have seen it, watch it again and revisit Butch, Jules, Vincent, Mia, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. Thank you, Quentin.Relive one of the greatest films of all time 10/10. Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Frequent Language, Strong Drug Use and Some Very Disturbing Sexual Content."
15/04/2024,4,"This is independent film-making at its finest, with the best ensemble cast to have possibly ever graced the silver screen.  Tarantino will never equal this.  Jackie Brown, being a pretty good flick seemed totally crap having been Tarantino's long awaited return after this jem.  Samuel Jackson plays his best role to a tee here.  A clear 10/10"
07/03/2024,4,Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) robs a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are thugs working for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the Wolf (Harvey Keitel). Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).This is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. It has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s.
04/03/2024,4,"PULP FICTION is a singular show. The best way to describe it is that it is as if you sit down in the living room with the television and are immediately transported to a roller coaster going full speed through a fun house of ghoulish images. This is complemented with one of the funniest, smartest, and filthiest dialogs I have heard in a long time. There is no other movie I can compare it to. It has the adrenaline flow of SPEED, the intelligent dialog of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, the violence of the goriest part of the GODFATHER, and the comedy of AUSTIN POWERS. All that having been said, it is like none of the above other than the superficial aspects I just mentioned.If extreme violence (e.g., brains blown on car windows) is something you can not endure, if 700 uses of the F word is something you can not tolerate, if heavy drug use is something you care never to see (cocaine is passe we learn, all of the in-gangsters now do heroin), then do not pay your money to see PULP FICTION.On the other hand, all of the above really works in this show. This is a parody of criminal life and a really funny one. This is a show that takes one chance after another. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are nothing short of terrific in it. Oscars are possible here. They play the hit men for a major bad guy (Marsellus Wallace). The bad guy is also paying a boxer (Bruce Willis) to take a dive. Harvey Keitel plays a fixer of problems for the bad guy. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple of two-bit crooks who like robbing restaurants because nobody else does that. Eric Stoltz plays a low class drug dealer and Rosanna Arquette plays his girlfriend who has rings in every part of her anatomy (yes, there too). Christopher Walken shows up in a single long important scene. Uma Thurman plays the major bad guy's wife. Whew, and I probably missed a lot of other people who did some great acting.The major hero and the one who took the most risks in this movie was the scriptwriter. He was also the director - Quentin Tarantino. The script went from funny scenes like a restaurant where all the staff were 50s famous look-alikes to a scene where the two hit men were first discussing what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in France and why to a discussion of whether it was okay to kill someone for massaging your wife's feet.This is a movie that to describe it will only make you want NOT to go see it, yet it is mesmerizing and wonderful. The intensity level of the movie is off the scale. People were laughing like crazy in the theater and to intelligent dialog too. Other scenes had the audience gasping for breath and uttering out loud ""oh, my god"". Several scenes were worse than the finger cutting scene in The Piano.The camerawork was mainly standard stuff, but there are several scenes where it got pretty experimental. The best example is the long scene of Wills staring into the camera without moving while he listens to the major bad guy, whom we have not yet seen, delivering a long lecture. It then switches to a view of only the back of the bad guy's head with everything else out of focus while Willis listens for quite a while more."
02/03/2024,3,"Every time I watch this movie, I get reminded why they call Quentin Tarantino a master of dialogue. It is a shockingly smart and original movie all the way through. Every actor does a tremendous job at delivering quotable yet realistic lines. It is very tough to decide which scene is the best. The burger scene? The ending scene? The overdose? The escape from the rapists? I guess I will never know which one I prefer, and that, is what makes this film truly iconic."
13/02/2024,8,I'm not going to say anything new here. Not my favorite Tarantino movie but hard to argue that it didn't do a lot to change cinema. And it gave us Sam Jackson. Must see classic.
10/02/2024,8,"I love this film so much. Way back then i'd only see Pulp Fiction memes and mimic figuratively portrayed. Poor being from a third world country, it's truly hard to participate festive on the industry of all kind, specifically film. So when i first saw this film, i really had no idea this is 'it'. This is perfect metaphor of Pandora box for mine. Got me so woke as hell.The aesthetic grain of Pulp Fiction fixated why i should differentiate what is really my liking and what is shoved into my throat. And watching it in 2016 where it's the era of minorities be winning, old racist joke is still kicking right. While i don't mind some spoilers here and there, this is the first time as long as i can remember, i'm watching without no expectation."
10/02/2024,8,"It was a day like any other. Wake up early morning, eat, school, jack off etc. etc. etc. I would come back home from school, shower, eat then try and find ways to waste time. I would flip through channels like a magazine, or probably treat myself to a snack. The thing that made this day special, was that I was going to watch (IMO) the greatest movie of all time. Before watching this movie, my taste was.... Generic, to say the least. My favorite movie was The A-Team. My taste was horrible. I recently watched Inception, so I was slowly being... Devoured or welcomed (whichever way you see it) into the movie world. After watching THIS piece of art, however, I was just amazed. The acting was amazing. The directing was pitch perfect. And the script... Oh jumping Jesus on a pogo stick, the script left me speechless. I envy those movie watchers who get to watch this for the first time. Anyways, fast forward a couple of months later, i already watched; Casablanca, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Raging Bull, The Godfather, Reservoir Dogs, Schindler's List, TGTBTU, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, L.A Confidential, Apocalypse Now, Fight Club and so on and so forth. I would recommend this or The Godfather for any person that wants to 'get IN' movies. Since both are classics and impossible to dislike.11/10"
10/02/2024,8,"Wow. Amazed. Shocked. Shaken. Scarred for life (in a good way). But seriously it’s hard to find words to describe a near flawless work of art. You will either love it or hate it. But you will have to watch it regardless of what everyone else says. Pulp fiction is truly fiction …and Quentin Tarantino (one of my favorite directors) has crafted this masterpiece to bring a bit of everything into it. There was no movie and there won’t be any movie that can be made in the same fashion as Pulp Fiction. It sets a class of its own. It is undoubtedly ‘one in a million’. The acting is superb, the screenplay unmatched, the script engaging and the direction could not be any better. Violent and real, it brings life onto the screen in the first five minutes. This is one movie I would see in the theatre again – if were re-released that is. But *sigh* we have to get used to the DVDs now."
24/01/2024,8,"Pulp Fiction is a crazy,wild ride of a movie and is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. It effectively combines smart original dialogue, wildly entertaining plot lines and many memorable characters. This movie is Quentin Tarantino at top form,delivering what is his greatest film to date,and one of the best films ever made. I will say that I am not quite sure it deserves the number 5 spot on the IMDb top 250 list,not because I don't like it but simply because I think that there are better movies out there. But to get back on the subject this is an amazing film. It is stunning in its brilliance and a joy to watch. It can also effectively switch moods at the drop of a hat. Sometimes it plays like a buddy comedy,other times it is dark and extremely suspenseful.I will say that the only complaint I could ever see thrown at this movie is lack of emotional involvement or feeling. I get this way with most of Tarantino's work but with this film I really didn't care. It is just sheer brilliance,imaginative film making and excellent entertainment. An absolute must see"
23/01/2024,8,"This movie has a legendary reputation. But I don't see why. It was smart,witty,charming in it's own way,and a fun movie,but it's not a work of genius. The constant jumping back and forth in time is really confusing. I've watched this movie I know at least 10 times,and still can not figure out what takes place when. And WHAT is in that briefcase? Someone once said it was someone's soul. Which raises a bunch of other questions. I see this as an ok movie,but incredibly over-hyped,and I think way too much has been read into it."
22/01/2024,8,"How do you review this? Like how do you actually review this masterpiece. It's actual pop culture now, like yes I have the poster (framed) and I have Jules on a t shirt, who doesn't? Now, I've not been making the Pulp Fiction loving part of me explicit lately because it's been pissing me off how people watch it and then act like they know everything about movies. I mean.... I was that person 3/4 years ago I really thought I knew it all watching this so yeah I get it amateur cinephiles but I still don't support it. Oh and it isn't my favourite Tarantino oh no that spot's deserves for Inglorious Basterds but this I second. I've been debating on this or Once Upon a Time In Hollywood for a while but the pure classic genius of this just had to take spot number 2. I mean I shall now and attempt to actually analyse the brilliance of this movie now that I've got the subtext out of the way. Structure-wise, writing-wise, soundtrack-wise, character-wise, action-wise and slickness-wise it gets all fucking right. All of these things just make a perfectly peculiar yet divinely beautiful amalgamation that crates the most unique vibe. The main thing with Pulp Fiction is vibe and how it makes you feel. It's not uplifting but it makes you smile, it's the prime example of style and substance. But I couldn't really describe the substance part to you because I mean I wasn't in my feels but I was invested, I was so invested in every single one of these characters even if they were dicks and even if they were only on screen for one screen. I think this is because Tarantino is brilliant at showing you real people, I mean they're in extreme and probably unrealistic situations but they're real people who talk about real things and that sits with you. I mean it's all definitely been said before but hey my opinion still matters, right?"
14/01/2024,8,"Quentin Tarantino's second film contains a confusing storyline, lack of in-depth plot, no obvious message, and a seemingly never ending amount of dialogue.....and it works. Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary film that has been applauded by critics and fans alike. The films non-linear storyline contains the stories of a couple who robs diners, two hit men who do a job for their crime boss, and a boxer past his prime who is asked to take a dive.The cast does a fantastic acting job that varies from Bruce Willis' street smart Butch to Uma Thurman's Mia who has a taste for nose candy. The two actors who shine in the movie is the duo of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Travolta's character goes through a variety of emotions throughout the film such as his laid-back side while riding in the car with Jackson, to the intensity in his face while saving Uma Thurman's character from an overdose. Jackson's character has a ferocity to him that makes the character very memorable.The camera work by Tarantino is wonderfully done with shots that include his trademark trunk shot and Mexican standoff. Also, there is a well put together soundtrack to the film. The masterful film making and acting in Pulp Fiction makes it my favorite film of all time."
19/12/2023,7,"One of the Best movies i've ever seen,it is the best work of Tarantino. Interlocking different stories into one with black humor, action and thriller are some greatest qualities of this awesome movie. The acting is dynamite: John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis gave very good performance. You will find humor, action, thriller, suspense and new sense of continuum in this movie."
04/12/2023,8,"The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. The non-linear and looping time order of the scenes smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. The movie is like several episodes of a TV show thrown together.Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. The actors are doing a fine job with the crap they are given. However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema!"
28/11/2023,10,"Amazing.I watched every second of this movie and was not bored at all. It had fabulous acting performances from Travolta and Jackson, good supporting cast like Thurman and Willis, the slick dialogues, natural realistic suspense, groovy soundtracks and a series of long camera shots. This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made. Standout performance was Samuel L.Jackson with his cool gangster charm and quick wit. This movie deserved the Oscar for best picture and never got it. Very sad. Jackson also deserved an Oscar. But again didn't get it. It was amazing that how entertaining the dialogue was. Even when there was no words, natural silence was just as addictiveA very much deserved 10/10."
20/11/2023,10,"It may have a clue to whats in the case.........I've had many an argument over what's in the case. The fact is no one really knows and no matter how many times you watch it and thing you know other thing throw it in a different direction.
My theory is it is either: Marcellus Wallace's soul . Clues being the plaster, Jules' bible references and his determination to protect the case, the 666 combination amongst others.OR It may be Butch's boxing belt. again references crop up to make you think that it is this. OR it may just be a clever stunt to get people thinking more of an already great film!"
04/11/2023,10,"This movie brings a new exploration of dialogue that I've never seen, and it's brilliantly constructed with some intense scenes. Samuel L Jackson is literally Samuel L Jackson in this movie. Pretty cool movie overall."
30/09/2023,10,"As an actor myself this should be a staple or requirement to watch for any acting class. As printed out in the great book THE POWER OF THE ACTOR by Ivana Chubbuck you see all of her steps, but to me you see the second step SCENE OBJECTIVE used amazingly in this film. Within each scene you really see how the actors work off of each other to achieve the goal of each scene. The opening scene set the tone for the rest of the film, and every actor in it no matter how big of a role the play absolutely kills their role. Fantastic movie from start to finish... do yourself a favor and I would be shocked if you haven't seen it but go watch it ASAP!!!"
18/09/2023,10,"There aren't many films that are as iconic as pulp fiction, everthing is so masterfully done from the witty and genius writing to the catchy and fitting music, this truly is a masterpiece for the agesThe story is somehow even better than everything else, its mesmerising to say the least, the heartbreaking and thrilling story is so powerful to anybody watching, but it's also hilarious, there aren't many films that can be a comedy and action and love story at the same time and execute it so beautifullyAlthough I don't belive this is tarantos best work, I understand that that's quite controversial but it's true, it's certainly up there and there's nothing inherently wrong with this at all it's just some of his filmography slightly take an edgeOverall I'd say this film is a must watch for anybody who just wants an amazing time."
11/09/2023,10,"Movie that within next 100 years won't be forgotten. Pure pulp classic, visionary fiction of a time. Tarantino is unique director. He had some kind of luck to break into Hollywood straight out of video store and I don't think it's possible in the modern days.Rare thing about Pulp Fiction is that.., what's the movie about? It's hard to say, nevertheless it works which is basically impossible scheme for any other movie. It just works.So overall, great writing, acting, soundtrack etc., this is one of the favorite movies and if you somehow didn't see it, stop whatever you're doing right now and watch it immediately.10 out of 10 not because it's ten, there are no real tens. Just there are movies that stand aside and above."
08/08/2023,7,"I am not a huge fan of Tarantino, but I love Pulp Fiction. It is so unique and weird and it's so fun to watch. It's the type of movie that you feel compelled to watch again because you think you missed something. Although there are multiple character plots going on at once, it all feels very streamlined and easy to follow. One of my favorites."
05/08/2023,7,"This movie has been debated and analyzed and dissected for years. I could make a lot of detailed arguments for why I think it works so well. But the simple truth is that when I saw this movie for the first time, on opening day of its original release, I had one of the best times I've ever had watching a movie. And it's one of those films that I could rewatch again and again. It's a masterpiece."
02/08/2023,6,"I never really like when a movie gets labeled a ""defining chapter"" of movie making or gets named a classic just cause it's different. Sometimes it is sometimes it's not. Clockwork orange is one of those which i felt was garbage as a movie. Pulp fiction is another. Sure, it has speed, weird characters and slick lines and stories all over the place. For me weird isn't always good as there is no red line, no real story to follow. I don't even find this movie very cool even though it might be worth a watch just cause it's like no other movie. But the story, the substance of the movie is very thin. Tarantino is for me not a very good director. Sure, some of his movies are OK, but mostly he overdo it on many occasions, which makes it hard to takes them seriously. It's no real drama, no action, no thriller, just something put in a blender it seems. If u want a true story, a movie with substance and an experience richer after wards, this is not a movie to get anywhere near."
22/07/2023,9,A very original story that could only be thought up by Tarantino. This is the film that put John Travolta back on the map and Samuel L. Jackson is also terrific in his role. Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career and Uma Thurman probably gives the best performance of hers. The cinematography is excellent and Tarantino really established himself as one of America's best directors with this film. A terrific movie that can be watched many times!My rating : @@@@ (out of five)
17/07/2023,9,"If you haven't seen this, you've been living on the outskirts of society with no TV for 30 years. It's a quintessential film to watch. They don't make movies as good as this anymore. Cinematography,screenwriting,dialogue, cannot be beat."
10/07/2023,9,"Boring. Rubbish Film as per most of Tarantino's stuff. The only good film Tarantino ever directed was the first half of 'Dusk till Dawn'. 'True Romance' was good as well,though he didn't direct it. It was also let down somewhat by Tarantino's poor dialogue (see Patricia Arquette's speech where she reveals she's a call girl. Appalling dialogue. Very Tarantino.) I recommend you spend you time better by watching all the films he's paid homage to (ripped off) such as 'Vanishing Point', 'Death rides a horse', 'the Baby Cart series', The original 'Inglorious Bastards' etc Tarantino and his rehashing of films which have passed out of the collective conscious is pretty unpleasant and not clever. The whole point of taking influence from other people's work is to then create something of your own which is greater than the sum of its part. This Tarantino fails to do repeatedly."
06/07/2023,9,The movie is as bad. If Aleksandr Nevsky directed it it would be very very wonderful. YOur Tarantino is no talent he is in a shadow of Aleksandr Nevsky. His movies are not badass nor funny. Aleksnadr Nevsky's movies are actiony good sotry and good jokes. the movie has not script it was directed on the go. Tarantino no scirpt means bad business. I thought the movie is gonna be as beautiful as Treasure Hunters by Aleksandr Nevksy but it is no. No no no just very really no. Avoid your spending time of life on this garbage go and watch Aleksandr Nevsky's movies. They are very underrated. Pulp fiction is overrated because Tarantino is no Aleksandr NEvsky. I know good you know bad.
25/06/2023,9,"one of the best movies ever made. I have been watching it every week since it was made, kind of obsessed with this one. This movie blows your mind totally and keeps you enchanted from the opening shot till the ending shot. A lot has been said about it already so i don't want to spoil the fun. All i want to say is that if you like movies and have not seen this one, you are a loser. I am not sure what to call the best about this flick. The plot, the shots, the music, the performances , it is overwhelming.its never too late, watch it now. It is close to ""the perfect movie"" ever made."
16/06/2023,9,"First up: I haven't seen all of Tarantino's work, so comparison with other movies directed by him will be nowhere to be seen in this comment. Secondly, I've recently seen Pulp Fiction for probably the third or fourth time, which is (for me) the necessary amount of times needed to fully be able to value it correctly.Harvey Keitel as the Wolf, Ving Rhames as Mr Wallace, Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, they all make a great cast. Not only the acting in itself is great, but also the chemistry between the characters and their surroundings and situations simply works and works very well. Simply put: they (the actors) couldn't have done a better job.The storyline is split up in bits and pieces and come together in the end like a bit of tape being stitched together. The pace is never slow, even when there are long dialogues: the dialogues actually make the movie go up a level! Lots of stuff going on: drugs, crime, death, coincidence, religious stuff, sex, and so on. This movie is definitely not for the faint hearted.In terms of the music and cinematography, this is the next bonus: an excellent soundtrack being put to good use during the various 'move on' scenes or to get a certain atmosphere during a scene. It's not just loose bits, it's all a fast food package: heavy on the tummy but tasty to eat.All in all a great movie, and yes, the first (and so far I believe the only one) that gets a 10 out of 10 from me here on IMDb. Must see. Definitely."
12/06/2023,9,"After almost three hours of watching Pulp Fiction, I can fairly say I did not want the movie to end. So just to give you a quick summary without giving out spoilers: Pulp Fiction is just about entertaining its viewers! This is what all movies should be, if you also consider Tarantinos opinion and this is all what Pulp Fiction is about: Great dialogs, cool scenes, awesome characters, phenomenal camera positioning, some of the best music and so on.It is something different here, you can do the same stuff in other movies, but it works so good in Pulp Fiction that you can not think of other ways to make the movie. Even the slightest scene taken out, would make this masterpiece incomplete.What about the cast? Could you consider other actors to take part in this movie? Tarantino gave Travolta another starting role for Hollywood, who was at the bottom of his success. What is the awesome QT doing, he is giving him a drug addict role and also lets him dance. This is what Jon Travolta is best at and this is what the audience wants to see. We do not want him see doing psychopaths, let him dance! What is Samuel L Jackson doing? Saying Motherf****er or cursing in English. That is what we want to see, we want to see a philosophical, aggressive black man. The audience loves it. Also Uma Thurman could not play a cooler role in Pulp Fiction, some fan theories even say her role in the ninja squad was actually The Bride from Kill Bill.To sum it up, watch it. If you do not like it, watch it till you love it."
11/06/2023,9,"The first time I watched this movie I was all of 13 or so, so it was difficult to appreciate.  Now, over time, it is a perfectly crafted entity, each scene a masterpiece.  Everyone knows when to arrive, what to say, how to squirm, and when to leave.  Flawless.  Quentin Tarantino is a genius, but Samuel L. Jackson is The Man, for now and forever."
09/06/2023,9,"This film had it's moments, and contained interesting scenes, but I just can't get behind a movie when I couldn't care less which characters live or die. You really have to look hard to find redeeming qualities in any of them. Bruce Willis' character was really the only one I cared even a little about."
05/06/2023,9,"As Tarantino states, its not confusing. You have to watch it but thats all he asks. And if you do you'll become embroiled with the most self reflexive film around. Cluttered with inter textual references to pop culture e.g pilots,Marilyn Monroe,Fonzie etc Tarantinos sublimely definitive post modern film highlights its artifice and as such we are suckered in.While the prudish may squirm at a 'immature celebration of violence' I personally applaud the profound approach of Tarantino presenting us with such outlandishly gruesome violence (pieces of brain etc) that we can do nothing but laugh. And for that reason. It's not realism. Nor does it try to be. On the contrary the surreal is celebrated here. You need only watch the scene involving Butch's selection of weapons in a standard corner store (a hammer, a chainsaw, a samurai sword) to realise Tarantino's playful homage to some of his favourite genres isn't halted by a reductive realist approach.While the narrative is a little disorientating on times, the beauty of it is that the audience become involved in the film more-so; it's their task to piece everything together. An interactive movie if you will. Tarantino being a film buff clutters his film with homage to some of his favourites. The dancing sequence involving Travolta evokes such nostalgia among movie fans for his roles in Greace and Saturday Night Fever, though is originally a nod to Jean Luc Godard for his approach of just stopping the film in full flow for a musical sequence. The briefcase with the light inside echos that of Kiss Me Deadly; a classical noir while Walkens tale regarding the watch mirrors the character from The Deer Hunter who was captured in Vietnam.On to performance. Travolta an unlikely choice at the time people forget does wonderfully well as our on screen stand in. He's constantly behind what's happening (the motif of events changing dramatically with every visit Vincent makes to the toilet is one often mentioned)and plays catch up alongside us since the narrative is so ridiculously spontaneous spinning off in unexpected directions(who on earth would have seen a rape scene ensue from Butch and Marcellus storyline, or Mias unexpected O.D- that wasn't on the cards was it). Jackson is the man as always playing Mr Cool here perfectly and Willis already a household name by this point brings credibility to the film, all the same his segment of the film is my least favourite. Possibly because of the playful immature banter between the two supposedly professional hit-man is just too funny. I just love the fact that in Tarantinos world, two dangerous murderers are brought down to bickering school children, scared to death of the thought of Jimmys wife arriving home. Not of the police, but of Jimmys wife. Surreal, but thats the beauty of this film. Simply has to be watched. One of the best films you'll see. I love Inglorious Basterds but i cant decide whether it tops Pulp Fiction. Either way both are amazing. Watch this film."
31/05/2023,3,"I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do."
27/05/2023,3,"Color me stupid but I thought ""Pulp Fiction"" sucked. Being creative is easy when there are no rules...as in fantasies and cartoons and, well, pulp fiction. Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several  years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, ""Pulp..."" -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting. Why no T&A???"
26/05/2023,3,"Ill go on record and claim that Pulp Fiction is probably the best motion picture Ive ever seen. After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not. Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry. Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible. Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good. If you havent seen this, rent it, watch it and enjoy it. Its one hell of a ride.***** out of ******"
23/05/2023,3,"Inspired by true events, a true story, masterful, twisted and bent Quentin Tarantino with a crowd of brilliant talent that destroys essential life to promote egotistic nepotism; in short stunning and sensational. Pulp Fiction has a timeless addiction that pervades the veins and makes the heartbeat faster... Why 9? Whine and wine again... there's something special about being inglorious... and years later Quentin is still pumping the fiction and mashing the pulp. This film has insights looking both backward and forward ... a reel show of American ideology that alludes to foreign infiltration of the system. How can one not love Pulp Fiction? From one of America's most controversial film directors who does not shy away or shudder in fear, a man who tackles complex thematic material head on, in overt gritty chains... and has managed to unchain the bleeding heart flicker by flicker."
21/05/2023,3,"Pulp Fiction doesn't have a plot. Or, it doesn't have a linear and evolving plot. Instead, it is just a collection of relatively unrelated stories that include some of the same characters. However, what makes this crime movie special is these stories aren't about the dangerous life and business of a gangster, but instead about just the day to day life of people who happen to be employed by the mob. Now, at first this may seem boring and pointless, but after a closer look, you'll realize that there is one thing about these stories that stands out. The dialogue. Every conversation is unrealistically realistic. People will go on long debates and monologues about everything from french burgers, the metric system, foot massages, tasty burgers, refreshing beverages, why some guy got thrown out of a window because of a foot massage, divine intervention, good coffee, comfortable silences, and just walking the Earth. Every conversation seems like an exaggeration of a conversation you might have. This is only made better by the intermittent action and violence that occurs, which only adds to the complete absurdity that makes this movie so great.Pulp Fiction is one of funniest, most interesting, and most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. 100/100. An absolutely necessary watch."
14/05/2023,3,"I can certainly respect this movie. As a form of art it is fantastically unique and masterfully eclectic. It is the epitome of a postmodern film - with no conventional story structure, no central conflict, no clear moral, achronological 'storytelling', and so on. It definitely needs to be appreciated for its incredible style.But as with most postmodernist art, tossing aside everything that makes traditional art good sure stands out as bold and unique, but it comes with its negatives. And unlike most reviewers I don't think being 'unique' is a sufficient substitute for being devoid of the traditional things that make a film good.For instance, this movie does not have great pacing. Partially a result of the lack of (conventional) plot development and story structure, but also partially a result of the often (deliberately) mundane dialogue. I realize postmodern art can often be very self-referential, but I personally can't see why a lot of this dialogue had to exist. It doesnt immerse you, it doesnt engage you, or advance the plot... its usually not even funny. So whats the point?But what is the point in general? Pulp fiction meanders around without really giving any core messages. Perhaps right at the end in the epilogue scene, it says something meaningful and ties at least some of the themes together quite well. And masterful as Tarantino is, the scene is just ambiguous enough to keep people talking about what exactly it means.So yes, this is a great movie to analyze and critique, but its missing too many ingredients that make a story great to experience."
11/05/2023,3,"Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and really a unique film by classic Quentin Tarantino. Quentin Tarantino is one of the best director and his all movie kept you engage from starting to end. He is a genius and believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable.Pulp Fiction is an iconic masterpiece that redefined American cinema. Known for its nonlinear narrative, razor-sharp dialogue, and eclectic mix of humor and violence, the film weaves together multiple interconnected stories centered around the Los Angeles criminal underworld.This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone and all the actors give their career best performance.The ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .""Pulp Fiction"" explores themes of redemption, loyalty, violence, and the blurred lines between good and evil. It confronts these heavy subjects with dark humor and a self-awareness that challenges traditional genre conventions.""Pulp Fiction"" remains a landmark in cinema history, praised for its innovation, audacity, and lasting impact on popular culture. It continues to captivate audiences with its unforgettable characters, memorable scenes, and Tarantino's singular vision, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films ever made.So, if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It's movie which filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, and great soundtracks. This movie is just a spectacular experience.10/10🔥"
02/05/2023,3,"This film was a wild one. Definitely blew my earlier expectations of it out of the water. The way in which it is told is brilliant, with non-linear, seemingly random, disjointed plot lines, that all come together and manage to tell a story of their own. It's an extremely violent, drug filled, dirty, gritty, crazy film about crime, but it's also full of great, witty, and intelligent dialogue and it's full of minute things and details you may not pick up on at first. It was an entertaining and darkly humorous film, but it's also an intelligent and revolutionary one that broke new ground, that I'd definitely recommend watching it at least once."
21/04/2023,5,"After being in the Sundance Film Festival with the violent and brutal film ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino came back with one true awesome movie that had everything to be perfect. Pulp Fiction, considered to be one of the best movies ever made. In this violent movie there was very good acting, superb screenplay, great photography and of course, GREAT music. Everything a movie could ever need. Pulp Fiction won the Golden Palm at Cannes and the best original screenplay at the Academy Awards. For me, it has been the best movie ever made followed by Amores Perros. A film with very deep and strong content. Pulp Fiction is all about two hit men, their boss's pretty wife and a boxer. They get crossed while the movie advances, and the pieces of the puzzle begin to get together."
18/04/2023,4,Every Terintino film I've ever seen has been awesome. This is no exception. The movie is so good and just interesting he has like four stories and ends up connecting every single one. The movie is super intense at parts and then really funny at others. The part where Sam L. Jackson takes that guys big kahuna burger and is questioning him is so tense since you know he isn't making it out alive. Also one my hands down favorite parts in a movie ever is when John Travolta's gun goes off in the car and he's just like ah man I just shot Marvin in the face like it was just a little slip up. The guys head exploded h=in his car! Anyway incredible movie definitely watch.Also if you didn't know there is a theory that was confirmed by Terintino That all his films are connected.
18/04/2023,4,"Well I had heard a lot about this movie earlier but after seeing it I can only say that it is a below average movie. I mean the only thing I enjoyed was some dialogs (although most of them were out of context)and nice editing job.But the story ,if there was one was plain boring .Acting was OK except Samuel who was great. I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke. Also Bruce Willis part was half baked and had very little significance for the story.So overall this movie which is a ""so called classic"" disappoints because bits of comedy like the Bonnie situation are not enough to make a movie classic."
13/04/2023,4,"I approached this film with some trepidation. You see I am one of the seemingly very few people who really hated Reservoir Dogs. I found that movie to be extremely tedious. This however deserves all the plaudits it has received. Breakneck pacing & some of the funniest one-liners in movie history left me gasping for breath by the time it was over. Characters in a total panic as things go more & more wrong is a staple of film & TV comedy, but when overdone it can be really irritating. It's a tribute to both the actors & the director that this movie is never that."
25/03/2023,3,"Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success."
17/03/2023,3,"Tarantino might not be the best actor in the world and a lot of people just don't like him and his movies full stop but I really do think he has created a master piece when it comes to pulp fiction and if you ever get the chance to watch it in a movie theater take that opportunity with both hands.I think the real reason Tarantino has been able to make such a classic movie is because he is a film fan and only a film fan could have ever put together the pulp fiction movie and made it work, I watched pulp fiction on my 50"" plasma screen last weekend probably for the 20th time and it has everything, gangsters, hit men, drugs, comedy, extreme violence but most of all it has ""COOL"" this is the movie that makes you feel like smoking or giving up your day job and being someone more interesting...in reality cool is not very cool at all and you most likely end up dead but as far as movies go this is cool."
10/03/2023,3,"Pulp Fiction put non-linear out-of-order films on the map. With all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to see one that's essentially a puzzle you have to piece together. Each of the characters have some way of bumping into each other. As a departure from the grave tone of his first film, the indie hit Reservoir Dogs, this started Tarantino's signature style of excessively gory dark comedies with humorous observational dialogue. This film is bizarre, has some tense frantic moments, will make you laugh and is overall unlike any other film out there. It's biggest advantage, aside from Samuel Jackson and John Travolta having philosophical discussions about hamburgers, is the fact that it's volatile and it's completely impossible to predict what's next. This was a benchmark movie and, in some ways, a paradigm shift for the industry."
04/03/2023,3,"Well, it's a movie of all movies. You can watch it many times and not get bored. There will be always a number of people who won't like it but so what... I love it even though I felt like it's not mine in the first time, but later ""Fiction"" became one of my favorites."
02/03/2023,3,"Pulp Fiction is often considered the coolest and greatest film of all time. But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isn't.First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they don't.Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isn't a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess."
25/02/2023,8,"This is an absolutely amazing film. Great story. Great characters. The layout of the film is truly amazing and goes against the classical 3 stage story, almost as if it is 4 short films with multiple separate protagonists and antagonists. It breaks the norm of movie story telling and that's why it is so highly renowned in the movie industry. Definitely would recommend."
10/02/2023,8,"What is the big deal with this movie?  The movie SO boring, uninteresting, and full of a bunch of moronic and trashy characters.  I just don't get why people like this film so much.  It truly saddens me that this film has, for some god-awful reason, made it into IMDB's top 250 (and currently top 20). This film is most definitely in my bottom 250.Here are some of the many problems I had with this film:The scene where Bruce Willis' character was first introduced is one of the most visually painful scenes I've ever seen, I was ready to turn the movie off right there.  The camera just sits there on Bruce Willis' face and doesn't move for what seems to be an eternity.  What on earth was Quentin thinking?The best way to describe this movie is ""just a bunch of STUFF"", there's no real plot here and the story doesn't go anywhere?  I found it really hard to give a SH*T about any of the characters, and I couldn't care less if any of them got shot or killed.What was with that scene where Uma Thurman's character says ""Don't be a square"" and she forms a little square with her hands (If you haven't seen the movie then you won't know what I mean)?  That was so STUPID!!!  I just don't get stuff like that.  Too weird for me. ...And people call this a comedy?  Where the f&*k is the comedy?  Is it supposed to be funny when they go over the speed bump and shoot the guy in the back seat?  That isn't funny, that's SICK!  The only part that I laughed at was when John Travolta and Sam Jackson were talking about eating pork/bacon.  I thought that was a pretty funny conversation, but other than that I didn't find the movie funny at all.I'll never say ""don't waste you're time"" while referring to a movie, cause everybody has different tastes. So if you feel so inclined, go ahead and watch it, but I HATED it.  I hope you enjoy it more than I ever will. Thanks for putting up with my ranting and raving,-Chris"
10/02/2023,8,"Enjoyable movie, not dull or anything. Had quite the plot twists & absolutely bizarre and comical moments. The characters I was rooting for had a good ending, which i loved. It's sooo unpredictable, makes you think one thing's gonna happen because it has happened in so many other movies, but something entirely different happens & you're genuinely excited about it. This movie always keeps you on your toes. I love how everything was connected & the soundtrack fit perfectly.But just one thing I wanna know, WHAT WAS INSIDE THAT BRIEFCASE"
06/02/2023,8,"MORE MOVIES OF QT PLEASE!!!! I just read that he will only do 10 movies! No! Please, give him money to make movies so other generations could see what movies should be."
03/02/2023,8,"One of the classic of Tarantino, you wont regret watching this, you'll watch this again and again till you reach the IQ level of the filmmakers. I see film making is the highest value that one can obtain, It is (I believe) more valuable than prime minister and president of any country. Amazing movie."
29/01/2023,8,"Jules: What country are you from? Brett: (startled) What? Jules: ""What?"" is not a country I ever heard from.! They speak English in ""What?""? Brett: (startled) What? Jules: English, motherf***er! Do you speak it? Brett: Yes! It all started when two hit men are on their way to receive a suitcase and see their man. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson stars in this riveting and explosive crime drama about four tales about violence and redemption. Quentin Tarintino, who directed Reservior Dogs in 1992, takes four tales and makes a classic gangster tale. The movie is packed with screwy dialogue and extreme surprising characters. My reaction? My reaction was that Pulp Fiction was that it was funny, exciting, thrilling and excellent. Pulp Fiction was a worldwide explosion with audiences and critics saying the movie is fun, thrilling and funny throughout. I sat through Pulp Fiction one night watching it on AMC and I thought, this movie is fun. It's cool and crisp. At the end, it was all-out conclusion. Though the stories are out of sequence, it still can be fun without knowing characters in random areas. The movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. All in All, Pulp Fiction is a cool, riveting and exhilarating motion picture of the 1990's. ★★★★ 4 stars."
25/01/2023,8,"Entertaining beyond belief. If I were to direct a movie, I would choose Samuel L. Jackson hands down. He makes his movie gold. Combine his talent with Quentin Tarantino, and you've got double-gold. This movie deserves the number one spot on this site. Not only is it funny, it is clever, it has action, it has it all! A unique piece of work, it will have you scratching your head, & begging for more! It won so many awards & deserved to win best Director Oscar, but was beaten by Forrest Gump. Such a shame. That movie isn't in the #5 spot on this site. So undeserving. My review will not contain a spoiler as I have too much respect for this movie. I can't wait for the Grand Theft Auto movie to come out. Samuel L. Jackson will star in it for sure. It will be the best movie of all time, but until then I guess we'll all have to settle for Pulp Fiction. I've seen this movie over 100 times, and I never tire of it. There are many unique film-making traits the director has, such as non-linear story telling (probably something he invented), clever dialogue - all created from his own mind, specifically for this movie. Not written for a book or interpreted by someone else, it was his work exclusively & he deserves all the credit. A true genius. I can't wait to see what he thinks up next. I will be waiting in line. I hope he makes a movie to even rival his own work. I believe it can be done. Hopefully within the next couple of years. I wonder what he's up to right now, probably chilling with his piles of cash on top of a large pile of cocaine & naked ladies surrounding him. Damn that sounds good. He's my hero. A true man of men."
21/01/2023,8,"Pulp Fiction embodies everything that Tarantino does right, this witty, shocking, and entertaining film combines all his traits into one great film.All his trademarks are here: the unknown music that becomes instantly iconic, the gory action, the payoff, and the stream of entertaining characters.Extreme bias, but I cannot think of any issues with this well crafted gift of a film.A solid 10/10 from me."
19/01/2023,8,"I watched this damn straight at 12 in the morning this morning and I have to say I really enjoyed it. Bringing some of the greatest actors together: Urma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken & Ving Rhames. Having solid actors really pushes the films to it's greatest limits.For some minor things, including the retarded rape scene with the cop and I wish Urma & Smauel L. Jackson should be in the film a bit more. i'll go through all the positive things about the film.Dialogue, 10/10: The dialogue was hilarious and at times very powerful and the swearing was over the top which I loved.Storyline, 9/10: The plot was very stylish and very easy to catch all the time and I like the flash moment back at the start. SO I think that deserves tremendous credit.Acting, 10/10: Do i need to say anymore, it was freakin fantastic.Scenes, 10/10: Everything about this film is really great and all the scenes (except for the rape scene) excellent and well executed. Most of the time I found the scenes really funny and for good reason, for e.g. I found the $5 milk shake or the story of a watch, lol. Even the action is compelling.Everything is well stable in this film and I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't watched this yet. I'm so glad I watched this film NOW!!!!.I give it an easy 10/10"
10/01/2023,8,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines - it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" - there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats - and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's - well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10."
08/01/2023,9,"This incredible 90's classic which is written and directed by the amazing Quentin Tarantino is simply one of the most unpredictable film scripts that has ever made in my opinion. A script to be studied for many generations to come. The fact that the dialogue in this movie is so incredibly accurate makes the characters of this movie live in your mind forever, and through those characters Tarantino gives us so many iconic scenes that are impossible to forget. The movie has an amazing depth for every character in that world of crime created by Tarantino, one of the things that makes you want to watch this movie so many times for many years to come and it never gets old.For all who still did not watch this movie, you are really missing the ride of your life."
04/01/2023,9,"""Pulp Fiction"" has partly gone down in history as the movie that revived John Travolta's career, but it's more than that. A look into the lives of several criminals, it's likely to shake up almost anyone. The first time that I ever saw the movie, my dad (who'd already seen it) sent me out of the room for the scene where Bruce Willis...well, I won't spoil it in case you haven't seen it. Also, while we were watching it, I was cracking up at the language - I can't even count how many curse words they used. This is one movie that will probably never get shown on network TV - they would probably have to cut more than half the movie (including Samuel L. Jackson's wallet).All in all, director Quentin Tarantino created a real masterpiece here. Top-notch acting (that spawned some famous lines) and a great script combined for a real treat. Uma Thurman's scene might make some people's skin crawl, but if not, then enjoy."
26/12/2022,8,"To me the movie had no plot and was merely an excuse to depict one form of violence after another; with no intent to tell a story, make a point, or to get the audience intellectually or emotionally involved with the movie."
16/12/2022,7,"Simply brilliant. The icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence , the extended dialogue riffing, the trance-like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly  above all else, the sheer direction less excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. In 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s Britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, you name it. Everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but without his brilliance it just looked smug. (The Americans get Tarantino; we get Guy Ritchie and Jeremy Clarkson.)"
10/12/2022,7,"After ""Reservoir Dogs"", Quentin Tarantino directs his second most popular movie the ""Pulp Fiction"". In this movie Quentin Tarantino won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen with Roger Avary.I liked this movie very much because it's a vertebrate movie such ""Amores Perros"" and ""Night on earth"". I also liked it because of the cast and their performances. Especially the performances of John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman was extraordinary.I recommend this movie to you because I think that movie reflects the new generation that came with Quentin Tarantino at the wheel!"
07/12/2022,8,"No wonder Pulp Fiction will remain a cult classic and certainly one of the definitive movie in cinema history.The beauty of this classic is the variety of interpretation it allows.Multiple viewing always refines our thoughts about this movie. Parallel tales converging to a convincing ending is certainly a different genre.Tarantino and Guy Ritchi are the masters in this genre.Sometimes different screenplay makes a movie unforgettable and surely this was the case in Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction is a cult classic and one of the movie that will stay in the viewers mind for a long time but certainly not a popcorn movie(a spiritual movie in my opinion) . Pulp Fiction is a philosophical fiction with a tinge of humor added to it. S.L.Jackson was amazing as Winnfield and Thurman excels as Mia and not to mention Bruce Willis but I felt rather disappointed with Travolta. A very satisfying movie but not an entertaining(depends upon the way you define entertainment) one. I recommend ""Snatch"" and ""Lock,Stock.."",if you want a more entertaining movie from the same genre. My score 8/10..If you are a serious movie buff..Go for Pulp Fiction"
06/12/2022,8,"This is a picture about mindless killing and idiots who think it is funny. Why so many people think highly of this picture is entirely beyond my fat rear end. The fact that so many people rate this picture so highly does not say good things about our society in general. When I bring up how disgusting this picture is to people whom love it, I get a multitude of answers that amount to nothing more than academic masturbation. Some people have the audacity to say it is a comedy. Somehow , I never thought mindless killing and standing around and laughing about it was comedy. ""Ha ha ha ha, he just got his head blown off"". ""That was so damn funny that I can't stop laughing."" Other people say it's a serious satire. ""It's supposed to show you the way the world really is."" Wow like I need to waste my time and money to tell me we live in a sick world. Simply put, if you like this film, you need to get your head examined."
03/12/2022,8,"Tarrantino did what he set out to do in Pulp Fiction - making a wacky, nonlinear piece of entertainment full of gratuitously over-the-top dialogue (or monologue) and violence. He made that clear even in the title; it's just a highly charged but disposable fiction. He succeeded quite nicely.
However, many his fans are trying to make it more than what it is, a cool but undemanding movie. While it's refreshing compared to typical banality supplied by mainstream Hollywood, it's far from a truly great classic some fans want people to believe. Interestingly, that's probably not Tarrantino's intention in the first place"
30/11/2022,10,"When pulp fiction came out it was w new form of order a new way of editing and visualizing the sequence of the story telling style
plenty of people from the cinema industry were against the film at once now they know how was Tarantino ahead of time.Similar feedback was against Victoria the German movie by Sebastian shipper
hoping that the industry will be more open to change of view."
26/11/2022,10,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a work of postmodern art. It's unlike any film I've seen before, and because of that, I commend it for not searching for a blueprint or a formula to tell its story. Tarantino tells the story from pure originality, and like many of his future films, Pulp Fiction is told with a non-linear narrative making it hard to explain the plot. It's better to just introduce the characters and go from there.The story is about very different people whose lives intertwine with one another over the course of a few days. The characters first introduced are Pumpkin (Roth) and ""Honey Bunny"" (Plummer) who are talking in a dinner with plans to conduct a heist. We then cut to two detectives named Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Jackson) who are trying to retrieve a briefcase they can bring to their boss Marsellus Wallace (Rhames).Wallace has his own chapter in the film as well. Him and prizefighter Butch Coolidge (Willis) strike a deal where Butch accepts a large amount of money to throw an upcoming fight. While Wallace is tied up in this deal, Vega goes over to meet and take to dinner the lovely Mrs. Mia Wallace (Thurman). A series of events happen, causing dismay among Vega which lead to some very well-written and well-acted sequences.Being that the film is conducted in a very nontraditional style, Pulp Fiction is a task to follow sometimes. My advice; watch it and just go along with it. If you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead, or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too. Viewing multiple clips for a second time, I think I finally understand it more, but a lot of questions you'll still be asking after repeated viewings.One of the most famous questions is ""what's in the briefcase?"" that is recovered by Vega and Winnfield in the early scenes of the film. I'm sure when writing the film Tarantino himself didn't know what he wanted to put in the briefcase. I'm also sure he didn't think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth.What truly makes Pulp Fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog. Tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan. One moment the two are discussing why a Quarter Pounder With Cheese from McDonalds is called a ""Royale With Cheese"" in France. Next, they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question ""what?"" again.Why do I not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films, but for some reason award a perfect score to a film that is made up of it? Because Pulp Fiction shows how it should be done. It depicts realistic situations, handled intelligently and with wit and soul. It doesn't utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary, but to advance an already crafty storyline. The character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words. Is it necessary? Not really. But Pulp Fiction isn't just about swearing. It proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade.Starring: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Maria de Medeiros, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis, and Quentin Tarantino. Directed by: Quentin Tarantino."
10/11/2022,9,"If you go over to your dictionary and look up the word cool, you'll likely find Pulp Fiction the definition for it along with a picture of Quentin Tarantino next to it. When the credits hit the screen at the end of this movie a certain feeling rises in my throat. Unlike some other of my favorite movies, where I look at the world around me differently for a few hours, at the end of Pulp Fiction I'm simply struck by a feeling of ""Whoa, that was cool."" This movie could be called genius and I would agree. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director and this was the first movie of his I saw and I have to admit that almost at first when I was watching it I felt that sort of ADD that I feel if I'm watching an okay movie. I was squirming around until the first shot was fired and then I sat for the next hour or so and was stunned. If you have not seen this movie, you MUST go out right now to your local video store and rent Pulp Fiction. It will change you, and you may find that you have a new favorite movie."
06/11/2022,10,"I can't believe people told me this was a horrible movie. I spent quite some time avoiding it because of the negative feedback. Now that I've finally seen it, all I can say is WOW! This was a truly great movie. Great acting, great dialogue, and it is not as violent as some people make it out to be. Definitely a must see."
27/10/2022,10,"I only viewed it for the first time a couple of months and I have to say from the moment go I loved it. It is a fascinating tale of how the main characters meet and how their paths cross over the course of the movie. I am not sure how people view it but I see Pulp Fiction as a series of episodes in one movie,my favourite being the one with Bruce Willis and what happens to him after he kills someone in the boxing ring. Another thing I loved was the star power in this movie:Uma Thurman,John Travolta,Samuel L Jackson,Bruce Willis, Christopher Walker Ving Rhames to name a few. What makes the movie so remarkable is that we as the viewers do not see the twist coming. Another quite remarkable thing about Pulp Fiction is that the conversations between the characters is actually engrossing. Pulp Fiction is a fascinating tale masterfully directed by Quentin Tarranantino."
25/10/2022,10,"What makes a movie unforgettable? A movie that will burn in your mind forever, and you'd always want to see it, again and again? I don't know, but most certainly Pulp Fiction has that secret formula. The wide range of (good!) actors is fascinating, and the gangster plot is more than thrilling at times.It's even hard to say what is this movie about... What's the purpose? Can't say. It looks, like its name, Pulp Fiction, but, when you look deeper into it, you find the plot to be unforgettable, along with classic moments such as ""How do they call half a pound of cheeseburger in Europe"".I think that's a proof to what a talented director and script writer can do with a couple of well done and furbished dialogs, a thrilling plot and an original, time-leaping plot timing.In short - No, it's not one of those 'So bad that it's good"" movies, it's simply a good one. Watch it, and I promise you you'll never forget it."
24/10/2022,10,"What's fantastic about Tarantino is his ability to make films that are entertaining throughout. He does this in part by having his characters discuss off subject things, which really helps the characters, and doesn't hinder performance in any way. He's absolutely fantastic at writing dialogue, and it really adds to it.Pulp Fiction feels vibrant. Pulp Fiction feels alive. And far from interminable, it knows exactly what direction it going in. It feels fresh and innovative due to the clever story structure, that doesn't feel convoluted at all. The story structure to me actually aids the ending, and the film as a whole. Incredibly clever stuff from Tarantino. Over time Tarantino films have become more and more bloated, but this and Reservoir dogs were perfectly restrained films. To be both wild and restrained at the same time to me is an impressive feat. Performance wise I think everyone here is on top form. It's an interesting cast, and a brave cast, but it absolutely fits. I enjoyed Willis more than usual, as he seems more free and relaxed. Travolta is handled very well, which is something that I would have thought is very hard to do. His characters need to be tongue in cheek and that's certainly the case here.For me this is a film that can only really be done once. Doing away with narrative structure in this way gives it a completely unique feel whilst still being compelling. I think few could pull this off, in fact I doubt even Tarantino could pull it off again. For bravery, creative spark, unique tone, awesome writing, and pure entertainment value, I can't not give this a ten.Ten out of Ten."
16/10/2022,10,"I just love Tarantino. This movie is amazing, I love the characters and the actors/actresses, specially Uma. If you're not a fan of violence this is not your movie, it touches some sensible themes like drugs or murderer. Something that I really like from the movie is that you can see more than one point of view, so you will entertain way more because they're all connected. I think everyone love the dance scene of John Travolta and Uma Thurman, and I think that deserves to be watched for everyone at least ones. This is definitely one of the best Quentin Tarantino's movies and I'll always recommend it."
14/10/2022,10,"There's actually quite a lot of one star reviews for this which are hilarious, if you're bored and want a laugh give them a read. The only people who can't appreciate this are probably children, geriatrics, god botherers, and those on the autism spectrum."
14/10/2022,10,"Let me start of with saying this is my opinion and if you do like this movie great. I'm not trying in anyway to diminish that joy. Just want to voice my own opinion. Now I love Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs and Inglorious Bastards are two of my all time favorite movies but this.... is a huge disappointment. The multiple narratives we're interesting at first but soon you realise they are pointless. More filler than anything else. It has no real pay off for this except I guess for the viewer to connect and understand each character. But it didn't do that for me. The ending is fine, the story is meh and the characters are very fake feeling. I don't know why but they came off very artificial except Samuel L. Jackson. The directing is amazing as to be expected and the cinematography is great. But don't let my review hold you back from seeing this movie. Even though I disliked the narrative and storyline the directing, acting and cinematography are hugely enjoyable as always with any Tarantino film. So if your a movie fan or interested in any aspect of film making you should definitely give this I watch. (However I would recommend you watch Tarantino's other work first)"
14/10/2022,10,"I saw this movie when it was just past it's prime at a dollar theater and boy was I ripped off!! This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. It, along with Fargo and Natural Born Killers are my top 3 worst films. I have no problem with films that are quirky but this film made absolutely no sense to me. Sometimes I will give a film a second chance and watch it again thinking maybe it was just my mood on that particular day but I would never waste my time on this movie again."
07/10/2022,10,"Man, I don't know how to explain this, let alone how to start. This movie is just the best EVER. Everything is perfect!!! My big time favorite is the dialogues, S L Jackson and J Travolta are just PERFECT, best dialogues ever. Also the setting is always great, I could watch that movie for days without getting bored. And of course the story is great, how everything flows over in each other, superb! And of course what I REALLY liked of this, all the information in the movies, all the hidden things in the movie that you don't notice after watching it just one time, makes it so mysterious! It is not just a 3 hour movie, there is sooooo much more to discover! Well, that was my opinion about the best movie ever, also (of course) Tarantino's best work. The four rooms was oke, Kill Bill too commercial.LATER! Wouter"
29/09/2022,10,"There is not much that can be said about Pulp Fiction that hasn't been said countless times before, it is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and is never far away from the number one spot on many peoples lists. Acting – Spot on. Characters – Spot on.Script – Spot on. Storyline – almost non-existent but isn't that the point? Spot on. Soundtrack – Spot on. Editing – Spot on. Quentin Tarantino – Genius.Pulp Fiction is a complete joy to watch. John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson give the performances of their careers. Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames & 'The Wolf' all give great supporting performances also.Pulp Fiction is an utterly pointless film; it is a movie that relies heavily on its characters and their scripts. The storyline is basic and feels unfinished but that is the entire point! It is a movie about nothing, it's simply a snippet into the lives of the characters and the timeline is all over the place, jumping backwards and forwards throughout the film. It follows two hit-men, a gangster, an underground boxer, drug dealers & a man who is contracted to get people out of the stickiest of situations, with complete calm!As 'perfect' as it is, I do have a problem with it. It's a controversial problem no doubt, and that is Bruce Willis and his hour long scene in the centre of this movie. I wouldn't say I dislike Bruce Willis as such but I do find him somewhat irritating and when I watch Pulp Fiction I do skip his scenes. In my opinion he isn't relevant and I don't feel the film would have missed his presence if he wasn't involved. This however doesn't affect my feelings for the film as a whole as the scenes with Jackson & Travolta are faultless and some of my favourite scenes in cinema. I consider Pulp Fiction to be a masterpiece.10/10"
29/09/2022,10,"I first saw this movie when I was 14, and I still remember it as being the movie that made me realize just how much I loved movies. It also started a love affair with Quentin Tarantino that lasts to this day. The movie was well paced, and even though it was presented out of sequence, it wasn't too hard to follow along. The characters were interesting and compelling, and you cared about them despite the fact that most of them weren't very nice people. But more that anything, this movie proved to me that with the right characters, the right script, and the right director a movie can be so powerful and compelling that it can leave us in love with it after the very first viewing. I may be biased. I have seen this movie well over 90 times. (Once a month, like clockwork.) I can often say the lines in the movie in time with the characters, and I am known to quote Sam Jackson's scene from the apartment word for word. But just because I may be a little obsessed doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth every second I've spent with it. If you haven't seen it, run and buy it! Don't just rent it, buy it! If you are a fan of film noir, buy it! If you like movies with a realistic feel, buy it! It will more than likely be a purchase you won't regret."
25/09/2022,10,"This is an excellent movie. It has been given a lot of negative publicity because of its violence, language, drug use etc. however none of it is actually gratuitous and the language and drug use in context. After all, Pulp Fiction is a gangster film. A number of things make Pulp Fiction one of the great classics of all time and a must see for all movie fans. It is humorous, action-packed, exciting and is thought-provoking. Pulp Fiction is basically three chronologically jumbled stories concerning two hit men (Travolta and Jackson); two armed robbers (Roth and Plummer) a drug dealer (Stoltz); a prize fighter (Willis); a criminal underworld boss (Rhames) and his wife (Thurman). Apart from the absolutely ingenious plotting of the film, Pulp Fiction also puts across the messages of redemption and faith, often in hysterical ways. The bloody action is prevalent in the film however infrequent and not distracting. The coarse language can be a detracting factor, with strong language throughout however this all must be taken in context. Overall a fantastic film and Tarantino must be applauded, not condemned for it."
24/09/2022,10,It's a great in-depth movie with many perspectives and different stories. It shows multiple stories of different people and connects them in a creative and well written way that successfully pulls the story together. The movie doesn't get borings and is very eventful.This movie contains very mature topics and when I watched it I was probably a bit to immature and I did not get the proper meaning and topics. But I'll rewatch in the future to really understand the movie. Overall it deserves the hype and I understand why filmbros glaze this movie.Would recommend if you wanna watch a meaningful and deep movie but wouldn't if you just want some entertainment.
24/09/2022,10,"How can I trust in imdb rating any more?
Long story short. It was made to waste your time and mine watching 4 people puting their brains under pressure to get rid of a corpse and his blood in a car. Very exciting indeed. I could not blink.
Or maybe it was made to show a man loosing his virginity as punishment. What an Incredible story and full of deep meaning.
Don't believe 9 rating for this crap. I don't know were does it come from."
23/09/2022,10,Yes that's right this movie is perfect. Every crime drama/comedy out there can try as hard as it wishes but it will never ever surpass Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction follows the story of to very likable hit man Vince and Joules (John Travolta and Sam Jackson) and a boxer who is in a lot of trouble (Bruce Willis). There story's are both compelling and original and eventually they run across each other. If you have seen any other Tarentino film you will know how he tells the story with flashbacks and eventually it all comes together. Quinten Tarentino's movies always have a certain amount of character and dialog that make them what they are. Pulp fiction is one of those films which you can't think of anything it lacks. Well I thought may be it could have used more action but if it did it wouldn't be what it is.So all in all buy this movie right now watch it love it remember it because it will be a long time before someone makes another crime drama/comedy this good. My grade:A+ definitely one of the best movies ever.
18/09/2022,10,"I will always turn to Pulp Fiction when I think of a favorite movie. Apart from the cultural impact that it has, one cannot deny the fact that as a movie, technically speaking, is excellent. What to think of first? The dialogs are epic, Tarantino cannot top this as far as he tries with his newest movies. The photography is plain and simple as it fits in the background of the film. The acting is...oh god. Give these guys three Oscars. One to Samuel, one to John and one to Bruce. They all deserve it. The movie starts in a rush and does not calm down for a moment... which is good...Every one can find his / her favor scene. Grats to Tarantino for this excellent piece of art. I believe that it will remain high on my / yours ratings for a very long time."
16/09/2022,10,"Pulp Fiction has been my all-time favorite film for a couple of years now and I have seen many films in the past but nothing can out beat the film. Everything about the film was magnificent. The script, by one of my favorite directors Quentin Tarantino, is the best writings I have ever seen. The performances were brilliant. All of them played their roles perfectly especially Samuel L. Jackson, who played Jules Winnfield. The direction, camera view, dialouge, and humour were all amazing in this one of the most popular films ever made. Overall, in my opinion nothing can out stand Pulp Fiction and its flawless scenes. It definitely set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history and that is why Pulp Fiction is the greatest film ever made.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
11/09/2022,10,"Pulp Fiction was an excellent movie. Quentin Tarantino showed us filmmaking at its best. Well-written, well-acted, well-executed. Story: 10/10. We're watching several stories at the same time, and in one way or another, they're connected. I can't say too much without spoiling it, so I won't.Characters: 10/10. The characters are so diverse, yet they fit into place.Acting: 10/10. With talent like Tim Roth, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman (and Phil LaMarr), do I really have to go into detail?Execution: 10/10. As said before, Pulp Fiction is filmmaking at its best.Pulp Fiction was great. There's really no reason to explain it. It just is. Hands down. Final Score: 10/10."
07/09/2022,10,"Pulp Fiction just may be the best movie that has ever graced film, thats including Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and Gone With The Wind. anyone who says that its just a ""violent, profanity filled movie"" is not only wrong but very stupid. Just cause something is violent doesn't make it a bad movie, and people should learn that there's a difference between pointless violence and violence in context. Tarantino does a good job making his character's ""real"". they have conversation's that sound like something that you would say to your buddy on the way to work. it also has some of the best acting EVER. in my opinion it should have won over Forrest gump at the 1994 acadamy awards, don't get me wrong i loved Forrest gump but pulp fiction was better. Pulp Fiction is a must see for anyone who consider's them self to be a film buff, or anyone looking for a good movie to watch over and over again."
07/09/2022,10,"Already a classic, ""Pulp Fiction"" never ceases to bring pleasure when reviewed (already reviewed 5 or 6 times...)Tarantino's legendary dialogues, which don't tire and don't lull, which many films currently sin, unfortunately.Excellent, seasoned humor, without stupid and inappropriately inserted memes, which, again, are now present in many films, unfortunately.Although Tarantino's other works are also very famous, such as Kill Bill, Django, Reservoir Dogs etc, but, in my opinion, it was this work that gave rise to this wonderful cohort of films, their style.Highly recommended for the younger generation to see what a really good movie is."
04/09/2022,10,"This is truly a great film, and always enjoyable no matter how many times you view it! Probably the BEST performance ever by Samuel L. Jackson! The fact that he didn't get the Oscar nomination for this film, and Travolta did is totally a joke. I cant say enough to do his performance justice. If you like Samuel L. Jackson this is a MUST SEE! Also the scene with Tarantino himself is very funny! The way Tarantino ties all the various related plot lines together is masterful. Truly a work of art by one of the most exciting film makers working today. The action never stops, and by the end of the film you're left wishing there was more! I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
29/08/2022,7,"This is, in my opinion, the most over-rated film of all time. Sure, there is some snappy dialogue here and there, and Tarantino has a good ear for music, but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie, nor the godlike status bestowed upon Tarantino himself.It's over-stylised, over-loud, over-acted, (sorry Samuel, Tim, John, Uma & Bruce) and the non-linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesn't work.But it's fashionable, so it's popular.By the way, this is one of the few films where I've actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end, so I guess I'm not the only one who didn't like it."
23/08/2022,7,"This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities about it and that is why I think it is one of the best to come along in quite awhile!  Don't look for this to be an uplifting or moving experience.  All there is to see is the disgusting underbelly of society, which I think needs to be shown. Tarantino may have blown his mental load on this picture but that is o.k. The dialog is just top notch.  I haven't really told you anything about the movie but this is just the best example of what the movie is about....nothing.  But it still kicks ass."
23/08/2022,7,"This is the film that confirmed Tarantino as being not only a top writer in Hollywood but as a stylish director as well. ""Pulp fiction"" pulls you in from the first moment and doesn't let go.Whatever a person could want from a film, ""pulp fiction"" delivers. Fast and witty dialogue, stylish direction, strong performances, flawless editing, fun and popular songs, and a unique approach to telling the story. Quentin is one of the few writer/directors that has the ability to have a movie be highly accessible as well as being filled with true style and entertaining substance. It's art that everyone loves. I've never met a person who didn't like pulp fiction and it's rare to meet someone who hasn't seen it. All these actors are giving career best performances from Samuel L Jackson to Harvey keitel, hell, even John travolta got an Oscar nomination for his role as the lead, Vincent Vega. The writing has a good ebb and flow between comedy and drama, sometimes a combination of the two. I can't say anything about this film that hasn't already been said. I'm just writing this review so I can strengthen my writing and this is my first review so cut me some slack. Don't be a square and get ready for an adrenaline fueled masterpiece of a movie."
22/08/2022,7,"I'm not into writing reviews, but IMDb asked me to do it. And considering the fact that tomorrow I have an exam and I don't want to start preparing for it, I would better write this shitty words instead of studying. So, I've watched this movie for the goddamn unknown time and it's still entertaining as a freaking Disneyland for adults. And, by the way, I must admit that minimum size of 10 lines is a really brutal torture for me, as I'm suffering from a lack of imagination as hell. And the film is still amazing, yeah, don't forget that this text is supposed to be about Pulp Fiction. In conclusion, I'd like to shout out to my mom, my sister, my cat Partisan and my beautiful girlfriend. Their support really helped me to write this review and to overcome this terrible challenge. This looks like the end. I hope nobody will really read this."
21/08/2022,6,"this movie is painfully overrated: every time someone tells me that pulp fiction is their favorite movie of all time, I die a little bit inside. Mind you, it's not a terrible movie, it has style and memorable moments, but nothing THAT great that justifies the hype among these pseudo intellectuals. You know the type: these college kids who just love Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, probably jerk off to Bukowski's poetry, think Kubrick is THE GREATEST DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME, absolutely LOVE to bash religion and make sure everyone knows they're an atheist, and yet still manage to think they're better than you. The sad thing about Pulp Fiction is that I used to enjoy it when I was younger, wasn't my favorite movie of all time, but was definitely on the top 10. Watching it now, having endured thousands of these guys and their egos, left me bitter and annoyed. I realized that I didn't even speak all that much about the movie, sorry about that, I'm just salty."
20/08/2022,6,"The movie features a non-linear narrative structure, interweaving several different storylines that revolve around the Los Angeles criminal underworld. The film has an amazing cast which includes John Travolta, Uma Thurman, and Samuel L. Jackson, who deliver electrifying performances that are both humorous and suspenseful.I've rated Pulp Fiction a 10 out of 10 as its sharp dialogue, stylish direction, and iconic soundtrack make it a feast for the senses each time I've watched it, and I can't deny the cultural impact its had on the art of cinema. Despite its violent subject matter, its a wildly entertaining and smart film that remains just as fresh and relevant today as it was when it was first released in 94. If you're a fan of innovative filmmaking, great music, and unforgettable characters, then Pulp Fiction is the movie for you!"
19/08/2022,6,"It has amazing storytelling. It has a non-linear storytelling, and it's done very well. Actings, musics are awesome in every Tarantino movie. It don't have so many violance but it is not a very big problem. The main problem of this movie for me the story of the movie. It is not bad but it is pointless. Yes he died, yes he left the job but then what ? After that what happened ? We don't know that. The only thing that i don't like about Tarantino movies is that. Only Inglourious Basterds and Kill Bill Vol. 2 broke that for me. Cinematography is not so good but no so bad too. Dialogues are so good in all Tarantino movies."
19/08/2022,6,"Pulp Fiction, arguably the most iconic movie from culturally iconic filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, is an exhilarating ride that combines comedy, drama, violence, and a nonlinear narrative. Featuring some of Hollywood's most remarkable talents, like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, this film delights with its dark humor and edgy cinematography.Pulp Fiction follows several intertwined stories involving a mid-level hitman Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who takes orders from his mafia boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Accompanying him is Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), his colleague and comic relief who brings wisecracks and quotable lines to every scene. They are tasked with recovering a briefcase of mysterious contents stolen by two small-time crooks working for Marcellus Wallace- Honey Bear (Quentin Tarantino) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth). We soon learn that the case holds tremendous importance as it contains items that could potentially destroy Marcellus Wallace's reputation if they fall into the wrong hands.Further complications arise when Vincent Vega takes Marcellus Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for an evening adventure at Jack Rabbit Slims diner, where they compete in a twisting competition before she overdoses from drugs prompting Stoltz's memorable line, ""She was brought here by YOU; thus YOU inserted the needle!"" Meanwhile, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is another criminal who must take a risky detour back to his apartment with Maria de Medeiros as his innocent girlfriend to retrieve an important family heirloom-a wristwatch passed down through generations-and Christopher Walken as the grizzled war hero ready to exact revenge on Butch should he fail to comply with his demands.Tarantino has crafted a masterful script richly detailed in dialogue that captures humor and drama more powerfully than any other writer/director today. His collaboration with Roger Avary has yielded one of the most memorable scripts in recent memory, filled with characters that simultaneously evoke laughter, sorrow, and empathy unlike anything else. It often feels like Tarantino himself inhabits these characters throughout their various plot points as he explores themes of morality in crime fiction while simultaneously poking fun at them.Pulp Fiction features dazzlingly kinetic cinematography from frequent collaborators Robert Richardson and Andrzej Sekula, which exquisitely captures both the frenetic energy of an urban underworld filled with criminals but also creates moments of interiority amongst its inhabitants which allows us to see them not just as criminals but human beings too whose lives we can understand even if we don't condone their actions or lifestyles. This combination of frenetic visuals coupled with heartfelt emotion makes for one electrifying experience that sticks long after you've watched it.What makes Pulp Fiction so special is how Quentin Tarantino manages to slyly explore moral grey areas without becoming preachy or sacrificing entertainment value either; it exists somewhere between spectacle and philosophy while giving its viewers room to come up with conclusions on their own terms while still asking more critical questions about life itself, especially when it comes to morality in crime. The casting is also top-notch, featuring some of Hollywood's best, from Travolta and Jackson to Willis & Thurman, all delivering career-best performances that reverberate years after its original release date making this one movie worth watching again & again! 10/10."
16/08/2022,6,A True test of how great a movie is .. is how well it. Still plays almost 30 years later ... well done. Quentin. And 30 years from now Django will too. Thanks for all of your movies.
06/08/2022,7,"I casually watch movies, and have seen a lot of Tarantino, and this movie was definitely on par. Old but good, and Samuel Jackson and John Travolta are really very entertaining in this movie. In addition, the story is told in a very unorthodox style. The characters are developed, but not overly so. The dialogue is great to watch and the action is typical of this kind of move. The story is a good one, complex enough to keep interest but not too complicated like other films can be. From beginning to end, he has you interested. The themes of the movie are very different in nature from one and other but come together very nicely in the end. I know this might not be insightful, in anyway, but it is truthful, I personally really enjoyed this movie. But who am I to say."
31/07/2022,9,"Rather than dwell on any bad points - are their any? I must have watched & tremendously enjoyed this film 6x in the last year!! and probably the equivalent every year since it was released.Tarantino's mark on all his films is evident - and yes it's obvious he's using his childhood experience or dreams? in his fantastic ability to make stunning films.& to top it off the 360 filming of this piece is a pleasure to behold? Never ever get bored of the quality this artist delivers, nor do my 16 & 18 year old sons.One of the best Directors & Writers ever!"
25/07/2022,9,"Pulp Fiction' was one of the best films of the '90s. With it's superb performances, and a masterfully told story, through flashbacks and a plot that has more twists and turns than any English country lane, pulp fiction remains and shall ever be a fine piece of work.Tarantino's blend of so many different styles of music, ranging from the likes of Dusty Springfield and Chuck Berry, mixed with the visceral characters of everyday life, makes it a delight to watch again and again.There are some spectacular moments, like Butch's surprise when he sees Marcellus at a traffic light. What follows is the best bits of the movie. With a jerky hand-held camera we move from the car crash into a random shop where the owner knocks out Butch, after he knocks out Marcellus.A key theme follows when Butch escapes, redemption. Butch goes back with a samurai sword to free Marcellus and himself of being in Marcellus's debt.What's my verdict? If you haven't seen this film, then you haven't lived"
21/07/2022,9,"Pulp Fiction could be my favorite movie, but that always changes. I will say that I consider Pulp Fiction to be the best movie of the 90's, with only Goodfellas and The Big Lebowski coming close. The cast has top notch chemistry, featuring the best performances of most of their careers. Travolta and Jackson's duo is one of the most memorable and entertaining in the history of cinema. Tarantino's dialogue and direction come together to make one of the most quoted, most watchable, and most influential films of the 90's. Tarantino misorders the films acts chronologically, to the effect of telling a character centered story in the most satisfying way possible. This has been attempted many times since, but never equaled. Tarantino's best film, a modern classic."
21/07/2022,9,"Pulp Fiction. Yeah.. what can I say about this that hasn't been already. I'll keep it personal, as it should be. For some reason I ended up watching Pulp Fiction as late as the day I write this review. Having seen the countless clips and memes of certain scenes I was anything but blind going into a certain parts of the movie.But I didn't come out of this thinking.. wat an incredible experience. It leans more towards a mixed bag with some diamonds, and a few less interesting emeralds. But I can recognize why it is so loved, and how smart it is, the how's, the why's. It's incredibly well made. No doubt. It was great. But I never captured me more than.. great. Film fanatics wil go on and on about this for sure, there's enough depth to dissect. But as a movie I'm not so sure I'd be bothered to watch it again anytime soon. Especially some of it's less interesting parts.What might be the real kicker for most of the ''lower'' reviews is whether the humor hits you or doesn't. It's played incredibly flat, in action and dialog. And normally I can really appreciate that but here none of the comedic moments, like the entire cleaning scene with Jimmy and the cleaning guy did anything for me. Though most of Travolta's scenes WERE great to me. So this movie is a real mixed bag in the end for me personally.Acting and characters are fantastic without a doubt, not just the performances but also the writing steals the show here. For me the first half very much wins it out from the second. The boxer story and the cleaning story just never hit home for me. The way the story combines is cool, but again, only really fortifies my preference for the first half of the movie.Travolta really turned out to be my honorable mention, of course everyone else is great too. Besides.. well.. seeing the director in his own movie. Look.. I thought in Reservoir Dogs it was done perfectly, early in and out, not too long. But he takes a lot of screentime here, and I sadly can't see beyond ''hey, that's the director!''. Whilst I obviously can with the other actors. It's a thing. In a scene I already don't like. Whatever. Fine. Just wish it was more subtle.So yeah. In 1994, this must've been an even bigger event in that era of movies. But for now. I thought it was great, but for me it's not gonna stick beyond the few famous scenes we already know and love."
18/07/2022,9,This masterpiece kept my attention for its entirety through its unique storytelling style thanks to Quentin Tarantino. This will now be my go-to when somebody asks for a suggestion. If I had to put in in one word: wow.
08/07/2022,9,"I really enjoyed it, even though I did not watch the film until recently, I enjoyed watching it! It was a cool action packed film from the 80s.I only heard about it recently from a friend that kept repeating a quote from the movie, we were in French class so you can guess the quote lol."
07/07/2022,9,"Throughout movie history there have been a few films that come along and change the way you look at movies and this is one of them.  This movie is one of the best of all time.  This movie has you cheering for criminals.Samuel L. Jackson's performance in Pulp Fiction was amazing.  He made you truly believe that he was a hitman with morals and doubts.  The end scene at the coffe shop was truly stirring.  ""But I'm trying, Ringo. I'm trying real hard to be the shepard.""Quentin Tarantino is one of the best writers ever.  His dialect makes this movie extremely enjoyable.  And though a great deal of the movie is talking it never seems slow."
28/06/2022,9,"This film is amazing! Pulp Fiction is the kind of film which must be seen. You should either rent it or I suggest buy it so you can watch it. The story depicts a harsh L.A underworld practically ruled by a man named Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and how he sends two hit men to carry out a hit. The story is told out of sequence which adds to the pure awe of this film. With an all star cast including: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi (a little bit), and even Quentin Tarantino himself, this film is pure enjoyment start to finish. This film is a modern classic. Do not miss it because you'll hear everybody else talking about it."
27/06/2022,9,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
25/06/2022,9,"Absolute GeniusPulp Fiction is THE film of the 90's. A film lover's  dream, this Tarantino masterpiece combines an original plot, superb acting and a script to satisfy even the toughest critics. Quentin Tarantino is a pure genius,  combining definite ability with unmatched originality in this brilliant black comedy/gangsta flick!!"
22/06/2022,9,"Saw Pulp Fiction today, and the only think I could say after it was...wow. 2 and a half straight hours of brilliant, but quite bloody. This was one of the best movies ever made, but also, maybe the most disturbing film of the 90's. This enforces my hypothesis that Q. Tarintino is a sick f**k, but a brilliant one.One other thing I noticed about the film was the number of ""f bombs"" dropped. Its like the only word people can say in L.A. is the ""f"" word. Language wise, this film made a George Carlin show look like Mr. Rogers. It made South Park look Tiny Toons. I'm not saying that profanity is all that bad, its just...did it really need so many? Soanyway, I would not suggest Pulp Fiction to the weak at heart or those partial to hard language, you will not believe your ears. Apart from that, see Pulp Fiction, its a great movie."
17/06/2022,9,"This is a great movie.  I rented it this past weekend and I thought John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson were great in the film.  It's a little violent, but overall it's a great film.  The movie is actually three stories that are put together.  It was full of crime and action.  Two thing that I like.  The film could have done without all the cursing.  This isn't a film for the kids.  However, it was a great film.  The three stories fitted perfectly into one another.  However, it did have its slow moments.  This is an automatic classic.  It has some memorable scenes that should be watched over and over again.  Overall, I gave the movie a 8 out of 10.  The other cast members included such names as Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames and Tim Roth.  I would also recommend The Matrix, The Godfather or The Godfather Part II."
14/06/2022,9,"I must start by saying that I am NOT a fan of Tarantino. I have seen a couple of his other films and thought, to be blunt, they were absolute crap. From them I gained the impression that his films were no more than violence, blood & gore thinly disguised by a weak plot and/or pretentious artiness. I had no plans to see 'Pulp Fiction' and would have avoided it.I know there are many others who feel the same and if you are one of these then put aside your feelings and give 'Pulp Fiction' a go. I only watched it because someone who knew my thoughts and this film kept on at me to see it. I am very glad he did.The violence is there but is far from excessive. What really is there is a great storyline with some good interwoven plot lines and many chuckles. Very well directed and acted. Enough to make for a very enjoyable 2-1/2 hours.So don't let 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Kill Bill' etc put you off. 'Pulp Fiction' is a damn good movie well worth seeing."
07/06/2022,9,"I've always been a fan of the proclaimed 'cult classics', as a teen, i find enjoyment through immersing myself within the ream of older film, which have been nurtured with perpetual praise for their sheer brilliance. This Quintin tarentino film falls nothing short of this belief, it is smart, acutely enjoyable and fun. Despite some gruesome violent scenes and it's ability to drag out long dialog, these minor inefficiencies cannot weigh down the amazing entirety of the film. I found myself empathetic with the persona's (especially Bruce Willis) with their ability to magnify likability. This left me indulged and intrigued within the heavy tension of the intense action scenes, promoting my sustained attention as to what was going to happen next.The characters, plot, sometimes witty dialog (a common trait exerted by taranteno) and action scenes favorably complimented my amazement with this film. A nostalgic experience also elevates my praise for this movie, a great cinematic work of art. Therefore i give it 8 out of 10."
23/05/2022,3,"Eh. Its alright. Overrated, i really dont want to type 150 characters please dont make me why are yyou making me do this please stop oh god i dont want to do this i just want to checklist this off the account thing it told me to write a review please stop it."
20/05/2022,3,"for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film."
15/05/2022,3,"After Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino was asked to direct Men in Black, Speed and numerous other titles, however he refused all so he could concentrate on writing the masterpiece that has now become the daring, hilarious and beloved Pulp Fiction.
Pulp Fiction was originally planned to be three separate stories all written and directed by a different person. Tarantino got Roger Avery and Tony Scott on board but after a few months of writing Tarantino realised that he had to direct the full thing. He adopted novelistic techniques such as non-linear structure and intertwining narratives to craft the astounding story of two robbers, two gangsters, a gangster's wife and a boxer.
The film is a glorious ""F you"" to conventional storytelling, there is no plot but somehow it manages to pull you into a world of witty dialogue and horrible violence. There isn't a moment in this film when I fell bored, after each rewatch it always retains the same joy I had upon my first watch.
Not only is the film great in of itself but opens up a whole different world of cinema I had no idea existed. It's because of this film I discovered Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini, it's because of this film that I found the treasure trove of Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe adaptations which then led to me finding the cult classic Faster Pussycat...Kill Kill! This movie managed to have so many references, without every feeling contrived, that there's probably still some ones only known to Tarantino himself.
Although the directing is top-notch there is no doubt that writing is the star of the show, Tarantino manages to go off on tangents about burgers, feet and five dollar shakes without ever making a dull moment. Tarantino says the Sicilian speech in True Romance is the best of writing he has done, but for me every line of this film beats that speech.
Not only did this film have a profound impact on audiences, but it also greatly affected directors and writers at the time. Pulp Fiction did for 90's and 2000's what Easy Rider did for the 70's, stuck the middle finger up to ""normal"" films and decided to go in a completely opposite route. Pulp Fiction completely changed movies after that. Guy Ritchie came about,adopting the same intertwining story technique and the same sense of humour and we must not forget Amores Perros and 21 grams all amazing films influenced by Pulp Fiction.
The affect this film has had on the audience and film in general is why I value it as one of the greatest movies ever made (and is also why I watch once a month, I just can't help myself)."
15/05/2022,3,"This is one of my favourite movie! I love Quentin Tarantino and I love this awesome movie. Everything is perfect. Actors, story, scene, music... everything. Love it!"
11/05/2022,3,"If I may, let me note what a year 1994 was for film. This film. Shawshank. Gump. The Lion King. If someone came up to me and started ranting about how this was the best cinematic year ever, I'd actually listen to them for awhile before asking them why they are getting in my face. Of those films, this and Shawshank stand out, because they were not pre-established blockbusters. Gump and Lion King were expected to be pretty big, and just turned out bigger than anyone could possibly imagine. But these films were smaller, more personal projects. They are also quite different from each other in almost every other way; a notable one being that while Shawshank barely made back its budget at the box office, this film took off. Over the last couple weeks, with Steve Jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. But it can succeed: this film is a prime example of that.This is important not just if you're incurably a nut about these sort of things, like am I. It means that this is the first exposure a lot of people had with a Tarantino film. I bet a lot of people became fans for life at some random matinée screenings some cloudy Tuesdays. This is one of those films that I would have loved to be there at one of its early screenings. A lot of minds were opened those days.I hope I'm not overselling this film, but it is one of those films that is so great that it is nearly impossible to oversell, which is a positive for me, as I love my gushing descriptions, as you might be able to tell if you read my review of Mad Max: Fury Road.One thing that must be noted about this film is that it goes out of order, and not a semi-organized out of order like Memento. This does not make the film hard to follow- it is easier to follow than Memento, at any rate- but it does make you think on your feet. Sometimes, I think that this whole movie is a then-young Mr. Tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. And it is glorious. No film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one.The title describes this film so well. It's not based on the style of blockbuster films. This isn't Jaws or Indiana Jones. This is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. This is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the DMV just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. It's not trying to be one of those Great American Novels written by Fitzgerald or Steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an English class or when they feel particularly scholarly.Of course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. This film is. It's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. It represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. In the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. Yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. But they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade.Artistic exploration became the norm. And few did that more than Mr. Tarantino, particularly in this film. Yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. But they did not get it in the way that they expected. To once more go back to MM:FR, I'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen Die Hard and James Bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. Their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. This film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. It transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. It is pure artistry.I cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. Pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. It's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though I argue that a more artsy version of the Hunger Games series would be a better one. But that's just me.As you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of John Travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. The soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. Enough so that when I wrote the words Pulp Fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (Misirlou as covered by Dick Dale and the Daletones, in case you were wondering).Above all, when I watched this film, I felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark. It enraptures you in itself. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised that it took off like it did back then. But I'm not surprised that it's remembered today. It holds a unique place in society and is one of the definitive 90s films. Enjoy."
08/05/2022,3,"The first thing coming in my mind for what we call cinema is the story! Doesn't matter what is the story about but how you tell it to people which in this case, Quentin Tarantino knows how to tell his story in an amazing way and we definitely buying it! His masterpiece never been repeated by him again in any other movies he made but I can still make a cocktail for my self, turn my phone off and enjoy watching this movie all day along. As read one of these reviews, it is both joy and a trial to sit through. Screenplay, directing and the best part acting is just spectacular and make the film work."
03/05/2022,3,"Pulp Fiction is clever, funny, well acted, well directed, thought provoking and extremely entertaining. Best performance of Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta's careers as well as an amazing addition to Quentin Tarantino's Filmography. The film is darkly comedic and makes you laugh hysterically over moments that you would otherwise not find amusing. The dialogue is sharp and witty yet feels very realistic for most of the film (occasional monologues aside). The film can make characters seem like total bad-asses just by having them eat food (in this case a burger) and can make you sympathize and care about horrible people. The film is extremely entertaining with no scene feeling like it goes for too long and every moment serving a purpose in the overall narrative. It is widely inventive and there is a reason people give this movie so much praise. All fans of movies and general cinema goers need to give this film a watch at some point in their life."
02/05/2022,3,"Some films date due to technology, fashion or political message. This film has none of it, just a unique combination of scenes bringing the best out of the characters. Yes some scenes drag, Walkens cameo is overly long, the scenes between Bruce Willis and his girlfriend unnecessary to the plot, but everything is spot on from the soundtrack to the pacing to the directorial skill."
28/04/2022,5,"Quentin Tarantino is a storyteller. With ""Pulp Fiction"" he demonstrates some of his favorite story features, like portrayal of a violent subculture and a cast of colorful characters. As the film tells us at its start, the pulp fiction genre is characterized by the lurid-a word that can mean merely colorful or extremely sensational. His films often border on film noir, but unlike most noir, there is a pulpy depth of character development that comes from extended dialogue.Except for a brief detour into a seemingly unrelated sub-story, the film begins with Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two men on the way to an unknown assignation. As they drive along, they discuss continental differences in language and culture. They philosophize openly and reveal significant aspects of their life views. When the viewer eventually realizes the nature of their outing, there is incongruence between their casual demeanor and the significance of their errand.Tarantino serves up his characters with heaping slices of humanity that undercut the judgments one might make if he was not privy to their internal systems of logic and morality. He reminds us that the old actor's precept is true: all people/characters believe they are justified in their actions.Vincent and Jules are not the central characters throughout the film. The story meanders in a non-linear way and indulges in detours that appear to be unrelated, but Tarantino has his eye on the entire, relevant whole. Though he may indulge in flights of fancy simply for the fun of doing so, he has a cohesive vision. Those flights of fancy are some of the most enjoyable moments in the film, like the restaurant called Jack Rabbit Slim's, where Vincent spends some time with the wife (Uma Thurman) of his boss. It's a restaurant that anyone might want to visit, filled with entertaining design elements and colorful people.As in at least four other films before, Tarantino puts Travolta on a dance floor and capitalizes on his ability to deliver memorable, if not iconic, performances.Tarantino gives us dialogue that is richly quotable. No wonder so many fans enjoy his films.Tarantino is definitely an auteur. His artistic vision is as recognizable as Hitchcock's or Woody Allen's. ""Pulp Fiction"", for reasons I have mentioned, is like a primer on how to engage an audience and take them on a journey. This is a film classic that will, no doubt, inspire other writers and directors."
24/04/2022,5,"Normally, I wouldn't bother to contribute my thoughts on a movie made back in '94, but I'm doing so for two reasons: 1.) It is my favorite movie of all time (and like everyone that uses this database, I've seen quite a few) 2.) I just watched it again last night (on DVD for the first time), which motivated me to go to IMDB and read the reviews.  I was aghast to read some of the negative comments that this movie inspired in many contributors. The following is more for the naysayers than anyone else.For those that championed the opinion that it glamorized drug use and violence: well, this is an age-old argument that's been pretty much exhausted.  Summed up in the question: ""does art reflect reality or does reality reflect art?"", I believe that it's a two-way street, and Pulp Fiction, evil intentions or no, rides right down the middle.  It's a glimpse of a world that I dare say is alien to most of us, so who are you to question it's authenticity in regards to its use of drugs, violence, language, and a lax attitude towards them all.For those that complained about the pointless dialog that did nothing to promote the plot: have you never heard of character development?  A lot of the things that have been dismissed as pointless and wasteful can be attributed to educating the audience of the character's thoughts and attitudes.  The ""pointless"" conversation between Jules and Vincent about cheeseburgers illustrates that not only is Vincent a traveler (and drug user), but that the two have a good working relationship, share similar interests, and genuinely like each other.The ""pointless"" dialog between Butch and Fabienne regarding potbellies is an insight to their relationship.  That exchange yes is silly and contributes nothing to the plot itself, but those are the kinds of pointless conversations that are often shared between a couple.  It's almost a milepost as to the seriousness of their relationship that they can enjoy such a trivial exchange.And plot?  Well, as it's been stated many times: its redemption, stupid. Not only for Jules, but for Butch as well.  Anyone who doesn't see that doesn't really deserve to have their opinions read let alone considered with any modicum of seriousness.Regarding the non-linear editing: is there a real problem with that?  Did it really confuse people all that much?  Were you still trying to mentally arrange the scene sequence ten minutes after the credits ran, or like most of the people I saw it with, figured out the jumps rather quickly and enjoyed the diversion?  Did Tarantino do it simply for the sake of doing it in an effort to be hip and cool?  I think not.  I do believe it was done in order to have the film end on a high note.  The alternative, if he had stuck to a linear formula, would have been Fabienne and Butch riding off on Zed's chopper, and that would have been a bit disappointing.Acting: what's not to like?  Have you seen any of Travolta's movies prior to this?  Utter trash.  With this one performance, he erased dozens of regurgitated, forgetful roles of leading men in mass-produced romantic comedies and dramas.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance was simply unparalleled.  Bruce Willis, who is normally unimpressive, blew me away with his performance.  The scene in the hotel room when he goes nuts after not being able to find his watch was just a joy to watch.  Seeing him seething mad at his mate's packing incompetence, and his fighting back that emotion and trying to reflect the blame back on himself...well, just the facial expressions were priceless.Direction?  Are you serious?  The needle-through-the-chest scene is perhaps the best directed sequence I've ever had the pleasure to watch.  You WERE in that living room with them.  You felt the frenzy, you could smell the sweat and the bong water, and you were just as on-edge as Vincent when you realized the potentially bad things that could result from the incident. That intensity could not have been duplicated by anyone of mediocre or non-existent directing talent.  The choreography was in a word, perfect.And as far as hype, is concerned, how could such a gem of cinematography not be hyped?  In my own defense, I saw this movie THE DAY it was released (and many times since), only days after first watching Reservoir Dogs. Basically, I knew little of Tarantino, but I knew that Dogs was among the best movies I'd seen in a long time.  Although I had seen and enjoyed Natural Born Killers and True Romance prior to PF, I was at the time unaware that their origins were with Tarantino.Pulp Fiction deserves all of the hype and all of the praise that it spawned. If you haven't seen it yet, what in God's name are you waiting for?  If you saw it and didn't like it, what in God's name is wrong with you?  What part of the formula for a good movie is missing in Pulp Fiction?Kudos to those who have praised it, and thank you Quentin for upping the ante of quality movie making.  My apologies for the length."
23/04/2022,5,"Different perspectives part of the same Story, most genius plot structure especially for the 90's, I know I'm late by like 20 something years lol but I'm only 18 so this is something huge in film. I noticed Nolan used this same plot structure for 'Dunkirk' and it worked just fine after I watched it a couple of times. Perhaps Nolan was inspired by Tarantino's work? Dunkirk and Pulp Fiction are the only two films that I've seen so far that have used this method and its been executed so Professionally, Bravo to Tarantino and again like over 20 years later..."
21/04/2022,5,"My Rating : 9/10""We're gonna be like three little Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like? Come on Yolanda what's Fonzie like?""Listed as one of the greatest movies ever, Pulp Fiction is endlessly entertaining and can be re-watched again and again.Big Lebowski and Pulp Fiction are two movies which have this rare quality - you just put it on and voila you're sucked in!Thumbs Way Up!"
19/04/2022,5,"I first saw Pulp Fiction on a bootlegged copy on VHS while it was still in theatres, which was funny due to the fact it still had the segment where Mia Wallace ""interviews"" Vincent before their date on a video camera. How surprised I was to see it in a theatre and see the scene missing. Quentin tacked it onto ""collector's edition"" VHS copies later on.The reason I watched it on video first was that I was sure I'd hate it; instead, it's unique, funny, touching, profane, cringy (hello, zed!) and flat out a great ride all the way. This movie is Also Bruce Willis' BEST performance by far. Most people talk about Travolta who is wonderful, but Willis pulling off a truly sympathetic and likable character is amazing. Sam Jackson also pulls off a career best performance - not everyone could deliver those lines from the Bible and make them sound as menacing and convincing."
06/04/2022,6,"As this is one of my most favourite films of all time, my opinion will be completely bias. However nothing can compete to this masterpiece that Tarantino created. Drugs, Money, Guns and a couple of bad-ass 'motherfuckers'.Just the right amount of each to keep 99% of people entertained. What I love too is the serious dark humour infused into the chaos, it makes you question yourself if it is funny or not. But that is what makes it a Tarantino classic. If you haven't watched this film already it needs to go straight to your watch list. I first saw this when I was 13 and I watch it at least once a year. Maybe it isn't to EVERYONE's taste but if you ever find yourself with a couple hours free time. WATCH THIS..."
27/03/2022,3,"A simple film, yet so intricate at the same time. Tarantino's dialogue is absolutely genius. If you haven't watched this already you're doing something wrong with your life."
24/03/2022,3,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!"
20/03/2022,3,"I would not say I'm necessarily against quentin tarantino, but I do find him incredibly overrated, with not a single movie at 10 stars. Now this movie is definitely really unique, and for that reason it gets a 7, I don't think I'd ever seen something like pulp fiction done before pulp fiction and it almost feels like the typa movie ud see christopher nolan make.The script itself is fine I guess. It's nothing special. Samuel L Jackson hard carries. Out of the whole movie only him and the wolf felt like they were enjoyable characters. In my opinion John Travolta was last generations timothee chalamet, someone who gets a lot of love but isn't that great an actor and a lot of his line deliveries aren't great. Overall pretty overrated 7.8/10."
17/03/2022,2,"I think the genius of pulp fiction comes in its ability to take multiple unique stories and weave them together perfectly through unconventional means. It can be argued that the chapters of the film work independently, but when put in an ensemble, each one gives us a peak into a world that feels lived in and larger than what we're presented with, at the same time, Pulp Fiction still changes the audiences perspective of the world it takes place in with each subsequent chapter while still feeling like the world we were introduced to in the very first scene. The chapters are famously unchronological and I believe it's a testament to Quentin Tarantino's creative genius and skills as a writer that a lot of its potency and impact as a film can be accredited to its unconventional sequence. Its a film about perspective, at least that's what I took from it, and I appreciate how the only real ""point"" or ""message"" it has is precisely that anyone can come to a conclusion about it, much like the theories revolving around the contents of the briefcase that pushes the plot forward in the first place."
13/02/2022,8,"An entire rainbow of characters intertwined in a bubbly imaginative world of neo-noir. The film is great, it's edgy and daring. Composes of seven narrative sequences and three main story lines, titled as the best written film of all time by some renowned critics and it's hard to disagree.. Pulp fiction is set in the world of humour, violence and inflated realism. It's is reaking of popular culture references at most times in the context of the sub-culture and underground. Being highly stylized, direction both visual and emotional, makes this film truly memorable and unique. No wonder it was nominated for seven Oscars and was also awarded at 1994 Cannes.. Pulp fiction is composed of all the classic best. Great and lively performances by Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis to name but a few; Great choice of music tracks by Maria McKee, Neil Diamond, Baker Knight, Al Green, Al Jackson an Jr., Willie Mitchell. Simply impossible not to like.."
12/02/2022,8,"The outrageously funny dialogue of this movie is what really drives it. Quentin Tarantino writes some of the most entertaining dialogue there is to write between two characters. Despite its over two and a half hours long run-time, Pulp fiction does not drag in the slightest as it is basically multiple exhilarating movies rolled into one with an all-star cast that perfectly fits in Tarantino's zany universe. You actually are left wanting for more as the end credits begin to roll. Even after watching the movie more than a dozen times, I still can't remember what scene comes next. However, It's non-linear narrative structure isn't what makes Pulp Fiction a near masterpiece, its true strength comes from the excitingly fresh characters and the crazy events that take place in the film. And of course, the quirky-smart dialogue. The characters in the movie are always talking yet always so interesting. You never really think you'd enjoy a movie about the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits, it all just feels so random, yet it intertwines so brilliantly. I love it. Undoubtedly, one of the most quotable movies ever and most certainly my favourite movie of all time.So, Pulp Fiction, 10/10? Correctamundo."
31/01/2022,9,"This film is throughout an extremely entertaining, funny, and very well written. The dialogue in this movie is easily the best ever. Scenes of two people talking in this movie are better than any action scene they could have thrown at us with this movie. The characters are all extremely memorable. This film in my opinion without a doubt qualifies as one of the best films ever made, and definitely one of the most entertaining also. Acting from everyone is great, but you can't beat Jackson's ""And you'll know my name is the lord when I lay my vengeance upon thy."". This film is an entertaining film that is sure to please those who want to watch it, and many of those who don't.4 stars out of 4"
08/01/2022,9,From Start to end. I saw no flaws. Just a rollercoaster and a masterclass for upcoming directors and actors. This is the biggest cult classic phenomenon of the last generation. I want Quentin Tarantino to direct more movies man. This man's a legend.
07/01/2022,9,"Not only is this a great movie with a cool theme. It got the most perfect soundtrack, i grew up with it actually, my dad bought it when it came out and i've heard the songs from time to time, and now when i saw it recently it all came back to me. This movie got me one step closer for me to like Quentin Tarantinos work even more. The movie was so great and the actors also. Loved everything in it, the cars , the weapons, the theme itself actually. This movie is a classic that will never die, people will remember it in 100 years from now. And Quentin Tarantino will be remembered also. The movie was not to short and not to long in my opinion, but unfortunately it had some slow parts in it, which is why i didn't vote 10/10 on it."
05/01/2022,9,"Quentin Tarantino presents his masterpiece: interwoven tales of a washed-up boxer, some bodyguards to powerful crime kingpin, and others who cross their path on this fateful day. Featuring an all-star cast: John Travolta in his best role (relaunching his dead career), Sam Jackson in his defining role (still trying to outdo himself fourteen years later), Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and more. (Many of these being Tarantino regulars, who work well with his idiosyncratic style.) How do I review a film so many people have praised, including my hero Roger Ebert? I could be a detractor and say its a bad film, but I'd be lying. I love the story and how it all plays out. I still prefer Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", but this comes in a close second. (Sadly, I don't think he ever recovered after he became famous. Subsequent films -- ""Jackie Brown"", ""Kill Bill"" and ""Death Proof"" -- all have a certain charm to them, but are not close to being on the level of ""Dogs"" or ""Pulp"".) Although I've seen this movie, or at least bits of it, a dozen times, I think the most recent may be the most interesting. I watched it with a young woman who saw Bruce Willis and asked who he was. I said, ""Bruce Willis."" She asked who that was. I listed a few of his bigger films (""Die Hard"", ""Armageddon"", etc.) but she said she had not seen them. How a woman in her 20s does not know Bruce Willis or any of his movies is beyond me, but it got me wondering: would ""Pulp Fiction"" be a different film if I didn't recognize the majority of the actors? Walken, for example, appeals to me because he's Walken. Would his monologue be as good if delivered by someone else or by Walken when I didn't know him by name? Curious thought.If you haven't seen ""Pulp Fiction"", see it. Tarantino is a better writer than a director, but this film offers probably his best directing to date and some superb writing. He is very dialogue-intensive, which I think alienates some viewers (particularly in ""Death Proof""), but give him a fair shake. This film defined the 1990s and continues to be influential in film today. Pay attention and you'll be sure to see why."
01/01/2022,8,"Yes, I admired the unique narrative of Pulp Fiction, and yes it was entertaining, but come on... you gotta bunch of people waving guns around in a wide open restaurant (including a black man who previously murdered 3 white men earlier in the day) with about 30 hostages for which seems to be about a half hour, and no cops show up?! And to add insult, this black man takes the time not only to recite a line from the Bible, but to also interpret what he feels this line means to him! It's obvious cops aren't in this movie because the criminals act as if they don't exist. I mean they really ACT AS IF COPS DON'T EXIST. And I thought Tarantino's repeated use of the N-word was low class, unfunny, uttered simply for shock value, and painfully obvious being that we knew he was going to have a black wife, didn't we? It's like someone diving into the water, but not wanting to get wet. Having said that, I enjoyed Pulp Fiction. But how could anyone think this flawed film deserved to win Best Picture. 2.5 stars."
30/12/2021,8,"""Pulp Fiction"" is hands down one of the coolest flicks I've ever laid eyes on. Tarantino's masterpiece is like a wild ride through the underbelly of LA, where every twist and turn keeps you hooked. The way the stories interweave, the slick dialogue, and the killer soundtrack all come together to create a vibe that's just so damn iconic. Plus, the characters? Total legends. Jules and Vincent are like the ultimate duo, dropping wisdom and one-liners like nobody's business. And let's not forget Mia Wallace, the epitome of badassery. Seriously, this flick is a must-watch for anyone craving a taste of cinematic genius with a side of edge. Trust me, you won't regret diving into the world of ""Pulp Fiction."""
25/12/2021,8,"This movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialogue, from the mordant '70s classicism of its long-take camera style and its smart, offbeat, strangely sexy cast."
20/12/2021,7,"Amazing movie. This should not be a good movie but it is. It's a simple story divided into 3 chapters, all occurring at different times in the story. Samuel L Jackson is so good in this movie. Bruce Willis is also great along with the rest of the cast. I was laughing the whole way through the movie. There were some great action sequences and intense moments."
18/12/2021,7,"I have watched 75% percent of this film twice: the first time, I watched it on TV, and about 3 quarters of the way, I gave up... However, due to the film's cult following, I gave it another shot (and watched it to the end) and, to be honest, I didn't like it anymore than I did the first time I watched it...Why is that?First of all, it was utterly chaotic for the most part. It felt like those experimental, amateur films, which I personally didn't like at all...Then there were the conversations within the film: as always with Tarantino's films, obscenely profane and crude, plus they get nowhere...Moreover, I found it over the top violent. Obviously, the storyline wouldn't be the same without all the violence, but at times I found it to be overdone on that department...Lastly, I found the script to be utterly appalling, in true Tarantino fashion, and nonsensical at parts...I only liked one thing about Pulp Fiction: the acting. Everyone did their best and in the end, wasn't the actors that disappointed me, but the film's script...So, the verdict:It might be that I dislike everything that involves Quentin Tarantino, (his signature obscene violence and cruelly long, pointless and crude conversations have always appalled me) but I cannot give this film more than a 3 out of 10. For me it was painful to watch, only to reach a disappointing ending. Utter loss of time! But then again, it seems I'm one of few here on IMDb that disliked Pulp Fiction..."
09/12/2021,8,"Tarantino, you genius! If you loved Reservoir Dogs, prepare to have a new favourite film! Quentin Tarantino blows us all away once again with 1994's ""Pulp Fiction"" with Oscar nominees Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Despite the scenes being in a mixed up time order, this is one every college student should have in their DVD collection. There are some scenes in which you can't help but laugh, even though a serious point in the film. I won't name any right now, because this is a SPOILER FREE REVIEW, PEOPLE! COME ON! But anyway, Pulp Fiction is sure to have you dying for more! The only thing I have wrong with this movie is Jules' Bible passage, which (despite being FRICKING BRILLIANT) does not appear in the Bible. But that doesn't matter, it's a brilliant film!"
08/12/2021,8,"Pulp Fiction.  The opening of this film consists of a literary definition of the title.  This alone should tell you what you are about to see cannot be compared to anything real.  But have you listened to the news or read the papers lately.  There's stuff going on the world that makes Pulp Fiction look like a day care center complete with cute bunnies.  Tarantino specializes in introducing us to characters, allowing us to get use to them, and he even getting us to like them.  Then all of a sudden he introduces an element that is so bizarre we barely have time to process it.  He doesn't give us time for it to sink in, but we still have to deal with this new direction while more stuff keeps happening.  The language, drug use, and violence are all incidental.  They are not ""Glorified"" by this movie.  If you make a movie about modern day gangsters in L.A. or any city, drugs and violence go hand in hand with it for it to be realistic in that respect.  I get the feeling Tarantino wants us to believe in the characters, dialogue, and overall initial premise.  Then he throws a monkey wrench into the works. How we react tells us a lot about ourselves. This is not my favorite movie ever, but it's definitely in my top 10.  I love the fact that there are as many people who love this movie as those who hate it.  That alone is a difficult achievement."
24/11/2021,10,"Possibly the greatest film of all time. A collage of images, stories and characters positioned in such a way that we tilt our heads in amazement trying to piece linearity to story arc. What we can take away is Tarantino's ability to revive a career (Travolta) and make one (Jackson) and still find a way to wrap a big kahuna burger into a tight foil. The soundtrack is also a clever collage, and so is each actor/actress handpicked and set neatly on the stage of a pulpy epic. And let's not forget about Willis, who, with his mademoiselle, adds another element to an already effective concept. After all, what's a gritty pulp crime story without its pugilist and his father's watch?"
19/09/2021,10,"Before watching ""Pulp Fiction"" I had no idea what it was about. My Mum had told me not to watch it, but as I was a typical 16 year old it made me want to watch it more. The first time I watched the film I was at school and it was too noisy to hear and follow the story as anyone will know due to it's non-linear narrative. I borrowed the film and watched it at home, again and again and again. I was hooked. After watching ""Pulp Fiction"" I bought ""Reservoir Dogs"" and was once again met with the feeling that this guy, the director is a genius. Since then I have seen ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Four Rooms"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". I have unfortunately not yet got round to seeing ""True Romance"" or ""Jackie Brown"" but believe me they will be worth the wait I'm sure.Returning to ""Pulp Fiction"" I can without a doubt say that this is my favourite movie in the whole world, although every film by Quentin Tarantino is to me breathe taking in some way, the cast, stories, direction and overall look of a film, to me make it the best of his work and anyone else's. John Travolta is a winning star in my eyes and when paired with the stunning cool of Samuel L. Jackson, the die hard persona that is Bruce Willis, the over powering presence of Ving Rhames and other cast members such as Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken and Tim Roth to name a few all add to the fascinating insight into life as a gangster. The dialogue is quick witted, cool and intelligent yet is so powerful with extracts from the bible placed perfectly in order to change murder into a scene as close to beauty as such a scene can be.I would recommend for anyone who has even a half a brain cell to see this film, even if it is just so they turn around and say ""I don't like it"" it is the sort of film that will eat away at you until you finally admit that there is something within it that you love. SEE THIS FILM, it's your lose if you don't."
28/07/2021,9,"This movie, despite the fact that I have now seen it more than 20 times, never gets old and certainly never fails to impress. The actors show just how talented they are and how much they are capable of. The scenes might seem to not make sense in the order they are in during the first time you watch it, but I assure you that after a second or maybe even third time everything will fall into place and amaze you. This movie basically has no flaws and demonstrates how amazing the art of cinematography can be.Many people underestimate the skill and class it takes to create such a movie but it is blindingly obvious that this film belongs in the top 100 best movies of all time in everyone's mind.This is my opinion on the film, it might seem overrated to you because i am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, but this movie left my mouth wide open and i cannot do otherwise but recommend it."
25/07/2021,9,"It's hard to put in words how much I love this movie, but here it goes. Pulp Fiction is an absolute masterpiece. A story that's told in non-linear fashion and keeps you guessing what will happen next...even if you've viewed it before. It's so amazing that it's nearly flawless!Where to begin, where to begin. The dialog is interesting yet realistic. Rather than giving us frequent exposition, which most filmmakers suffer from, Tarantino has found a way for his memorable characters to discuss pointless things that are fascinating to listen to while developing strong character traits. The movie's time-line is complex but to summarize it in one sentence, it shifts around both forward and backwards between sequences. The direction is sure-handed and Tarantino isn't afraid to hold a shot that flows smoothly with the way its edited. The casting is first-rate, this is the movie that helped revive John Travolta's career and made the rest of the actors' reputable to the Hollywood system.For those who are concerned about the level of violence, it's actually not as graphic as it seems. Yes, it's intense but if you look closely, the content of it isn't gratuitous or repulsive. Gene Siskel touched upon this in one of his reviews with Roger Ebert. For example, Bruce Willis swipes a man with a samurai sword. The victim is faced away from the camera so you don't see the weapon attack him. Then, when Willis stabs the sword into the guy's knee, it's out of frame and we only hear the sound effect & see his reaction.Don't worry, I'm wrapping this up. If you can surpass the hype and enjoy it for what it is, you are going to have a fun two hours. Hope you see it after reading this and enjoy your tasty burger!"
21/07/2021,9,"Tarantino creo lo que posiblemente es el inicio para aquellos que nos interesa el cine que va mas allá de lo comercial. Adoro esta película por ser de las primeras que he visto de manera seria en mi vida, y por la maravillosa creación de personaje que hay en ella."
13/07/2021,9,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a cult classic that revolutionized the crime genre. Released in 1994, the film is a neo-noir masterpiece with a complex, interwoven narrative, sharp dialogue, and unforgettable characters.Tarantino's signature style is on full display in Pulp Fiction, with its non-linear storytelling, graphic violence, and dark humor. The film follows several Los Angeles criminals whose lives intertwine in unexpected ways. Hitmen Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) navigate the city's underworld, while boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is tempted to double-cross his mob boss.Pulp Fiction is a film that rewards multiple viewings. With its intricate plot and clever dialogue, there's always something new to discover. The film's soundtrack is also iconic, featuring a mix of surf rock, soul, and pop that perfectly captures the film's atmosphere.Whether you're a fan of crime movies, independent cinema, or simply great storytelling, Pulp Fiction is a must-see. It's a wild ride that will stay with you long after the credits roll."
11/07/2021,9,"The American neo-noir black comedy crime film Pulp Fiction is directed and written by Quentin Tarantino and produced by Roger Avary.Pulp Fiction is a classic of modern American cinema, and its influence still can be felt today. The nonlinear narrative structure, clever use of dialogue, and memorable characters all make for a unique and engaging viewing experience. Travolta and Jackson deliver standout performances as hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, and Thurman is unforgettable as Mia Wallace, the drug-addled wife of gangster Marcellus Wallace (Rhames).One of Pulp Fiction's most unique elements is its music, which perfectly complements the action on screen. The film's eclectic soundtrack ranges from surf rock to soul, and each song is selected carefully to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the scene it accompanies.Overall, Pulp Fiction is a must-see for any fan of the film. It's a clever, stylish, and entertaining movie that has stood the test of time and remains a cultural touchstone."
29/06/2021,9,"Pulp Fiction is one of those brilliant type of films that you truly discover more and more each time you watch it. Like a kid in a candy store, there are more treats than one can handle in a single viewing. This is evidenced by the recent string of posts on the Pulp Fiction board entitled ""500 Things You've Noticed About Pulp Fiction."" Not too many movies have so many things going for it.This is truly a movie that defined a generation. After Pulp, a string of films came out that attempted to recapture the magic of Pulp: 2 Days in the Valley, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Go., and many more. Each of these movies had something going for it; but each movie seemed to only bring to the table one of the many elements that made pulp so rich, whether it be the non-linear storytelling, witty dialogue with pop-culture reference, hipper-than-thou characters, or absurd, out-of-nowhere plot twists. Pulp, however, had the whole package in one movie."
14/06/2021,9,"This movie has forever changed the face of film-making. Never had a movie with so many seedy, unlikable characters gained such wide praise, without having any glamorous drama or action. The movie is about as real as it gets. I have read many criticisms outlining the lack of meaning in the dialogue. To me thats the genius of it. This is everyday s**t that any two people in a car or restaurant are discussing. How many people sit in a diner or any other business talking about what it would be like to rob the place? How many guys talk about foot massages? Mia Wallace is top of the line on meaningless conversation, especially in her deleted scenes with Vincent getting his interview.The movie winds together beautifully, and I love the fact that most of the morons I know dismiss it merely on its lack of continuity. It rightfully deserves its praise. If you judge it on nothing else, judge it on its entertainment value. I can watch this film 50 times in 50 days, its that much fun"
18/05/2021,2,"Pulp fiction is one of the best crime/ dramatic movie of my time. The movie had such a great cast, and some intense dramatic scene pretty much through the whole movie. I remember not liking this movie when I was a kid, but now that I am older I really enjoy watching this film. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie but the most memorable scene I think was when Uma Thurman and John Travolta are dancing on stage at the restaurant to "" You never can tell"" by Chuck Berry. Another famous and great scene is Samuel L Jacksons speech hes giving to the guy while shooting every one else. A lot of action shots in this film, drugs, guns, and violence. A very brilliantly shot film."
17/05/2021,2,"It may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'Pulp Fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. Yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, I would imagine - stand the test of time. But is it for everyone?It's Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and I'd agree). However, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? I guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. It's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. Confused? Stick with it. It's worth it.If you check out the main poster associated with 'Pulp Fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of Uma Thurman's character to sell it. Even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and - of course - Samuel L Jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). This is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. However, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance.'Pulp Fiction' has made it's mark on not only the Box Office and takings, but also on popular culture. It's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in.Due to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. And it's all the better for it. This is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. For all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. You can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your Instagram account on your phone. You really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. Because of that it's not for idle viewers. It's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!).If you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'Pulp Fiction' a little hard to watch. However, even if you're not sure about it, I would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. Plus, as I've eluded to, Samuel L Jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. They don't make them like this any more. Even Tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here."
17/05/2021,2,"You cannot resist watching a movie with Uma Thurman, Samuel Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken, plus you definitely cannot resist watching a movie directed and part written by Quentin Tarantino. So, nuff said, one of the all time iconic must see movies."
07/05/2021,2,"This movie is amazing. I love Tarantino. I love violence. I love this movie. This movie is so freaking good that i could talk about it for hours. It was not the first Tarantino movie i saw, nor the 2nd,3rd, or 4th but it should have been. I now know why this movie is so well known. The cinematography is awesome and the whole look of the film in general is an experience to see. The really cool thing about this movie is that its shot out of chronological order. The scenes are completely all over the place. They do not go in order. Its different and could confuse you but i was still able to pick up on the movie and what was going on because all though none of the scenes were shot in order they all connect to each other a little bit in a way. I think that the way its shot out of chronological order makes the movie awesome and unique. I've seen a number of movies shot out of chronological order but this one is the best in my opinion. Im not lying when i say everything about this movie is a freaking trip! Its got an insanely good cast starring in it and it has a lot of violence. Love this movie. Tarantino never disappoints me."
05/05/2021,2,"This is the movie which has one of the most briliant Hungarian dub - which of coruse does not give back everything perfectly, but... just briliant, the original and the hugnarian dub as well."
14/04/2021,4,"From what I gather, and my own reaction, people either love this movie or hate it. Strangely, I have been on both sides of the fence with this film. I never look at it in the same light, for some reason. At first I hated it and on a second chance, really liked it. Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.This is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?Two things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest. With 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all."
09/04/2021,6,"Pulp Fiction is a terrific movie! It has all the characteristics of a perfect movie: engaging plot, memorable characters, excellent writing and directing, and awesome music! Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best film-makers of all time. I love all of his movies and I never get tired of watching any of them! Pulp Fiction is just another example of how awesome Tarantino is as a film-maker.Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that requires a second viewing or more to truly understand it and enjoy it more. Not only does it get better with each viewing but it also becomes easier to understand as you notice how Tarantino focuses on the small details of the film and how the small details relate to the main plot. For example: the connection between Marsellus Wallace's Band-Aid on his neck and the suitcase.There is a fan theory that says that Marsellus sold his soul to the devil and his soul is inside the suitcase. The fan theory states that in order the extract a soul, it has to come from the back of the neck thus explaining the Band-Aid on Wallace's neck. Tarantino has not come out and proved that theory true or not. Personally, I think Tarantino ultimately led the guessing to the fans as they come up with possible outcomes. The acting and dialogue is over the top and straight forward and I couldn't have possibly thought of a better cast to play the characters.When the film was nominated for all of those Academy Awards in '94, there was very tough competition since other films like Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption were also nominated. But I won't complain since those 2 movies are really good too. However, I believe Pulp Fiction deserved the Oscar for Best Original Script and I'm really glad it won! In conclusion, Pulp Fiction is a cinematic masterpiece that will forever be a highly significant film even after all these years."
24/03/2021,2,"This is indeed the best movie I have ever seen. I don't know how people actually hate it. It's a totally original movie, its got everything from violence to extreme profanity. this in my opinion gets a 10/10 for sure."
19/03/2021,2,"This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB."
13/03/2021,2,"The movie is a classic, without a doubt. Its very entertaining and features fantastic acting and writing. The movie however, does not have the most powerful meaning its more something that you watch for fun. I must also admit that Quentin Tarantino's style is not my cup of tea. However, I still have to respect the ingenuity of which this film has been made."
11/03/2021,2,"""What a unwasted long movie, terrific perfomance by all of the cast including Mr. Tarantino himself i think he is a great actor here, the story no doubt it's brilliant, and of course i will never stop writing this but the music that Tarantino choose is always perfect, i really enjoyed this, don't worry about the duration just enjoyed the whole story, Pulp Fiction is a movie that no matter how many you watch this movie even till like a thousand times it will always and forever be good, i highly recommended"""
11/03/2021,2,"I must average viewing this flick around six times per year. Every two months -- yeah, that sounds about right. Are there really any other films out there with legendary scene after legendary scene after legendary scene? Maybe, but not on the same scale as Pulp Fiction.Who hasn't seen this already? I mean, really? Do these people exist?WATCH THIS FILM!THEN WATCH IT AGAIN!AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN!YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH!"
08/03/2021,2,From the moment the movie starts it is captivating. with its non-linear story structure allows you to jump into your favorite scene and or watch the scenes in the order in which you feel is best.
07/03/2021,2,"While smoking, sex, nudity, violence, frightning/intense scenes are a main theme in Pulp Fiction, but it is good. Why? I have not seen the movie, but yet again I will know it will be awesome! A must-watch and recommendation!!!"
04/03/2021,2,"It is a good movie, Action packed and interesting use of time. If you like Fight Club you will like Pulp fiction. I found the acting to be well done with an amazing performance from Samuel L. Jackson, and John Travolta. This movie can be comic and sad at the same time and contains very many different view points about how life works. I found that this movie is not at all rated for children and should be avoided by those who are easily offended or have weak stomachs. Drug use is prevalent in this movie. I am very pleased with the overall final result, great flick. I recently had to pick my top five movies of all time that I enjoyed and this made the list, following Fight Club and many great films to the same strength and fortitude."
23/02/2021,8,"""Pulp Fiction"" is an absolute masterpiece that revolutionized the crime genre. With its non-linear storytelling and unforgettable characters, Quentin Tarantino crafts a cinematic experience like no other. The film oozes with style, from the iconic dialogue to the killer soundtrack. The performances by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman are nothing short of brilliant. The dark humor and unexpected twists keep you on the edge of your seat. Tarantino's expert direction and attention to detail make every scene a work of art. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a wild ride filled with violence, wit, and memorable moments. It's a must-watch for any film lover looking for a bold and unconventional masterpiece. 🎥🔫✨"
22/02/2021,8,talk about a Lousy movie.. this one was Ridiulous !! i couldnt understand it at All .. i only watched half of it.. [the part with Bruce Willis] and soon as that was over i re-wound it .. talk about a waste of good money..and why would all the actors in this movie want to be associated with such junk ?? what were they thinking ??? it sure confused the heck out of me thats for sure.. i cant see what the big deal was with this sorry excuse for a movie.. it is a waste of film and a waste of the actors times as i see it... i would advise someone not to use their hard earned money on this drivel.. rent something else instead of this turkey !!
21/02/2021,8,"At the beginning of the film, right before it starts, there is a definition of the two words that make up the title of this film. One word that should have been defined is the word classic. If you ask me what my definition of a classic film is, it is one that is easily remembered, whether that be by memorable quotes, characters or scenery and thoroughly enjoyable to the point where you will want to see it on a regular basis. I could go on and on about all of that but I will say this is one film that has changed the way I see films. It has become one of my all time favourites as a result. As soon as I started watching it the first time, I knew this was something special. I cannot even tell you how many times I have watched it but I always remember the witty dialogue, the violence, characters, etc. Even thought it is officially defined as a crime/drama film, I can't help but find a few of the scenes as side splitting hilarious. I see perfection as a bit of a myth but to me, Pulp Fiction is as close as it comes to a perfect film. The casting of the roles is very good, in particular, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman, script writing is fantastic, not just because of the witty dialogue but due to Quentin Tarantino being brave by telling this story in a non-traditional, non-linear fashion. Kudos also to Tarantino's direction, showing why he is one of the best modern Hollywood directors out there. Speaking of kudos, I think Pulp Fiction's legacy has grown since being released in 1994 and should have won at least two more Academy Awards, namely Samuel L. Jackson as Best Supporting Actor and Quentin Tarantino as Best Director. Nevertheless, it has truly stood the test of time and is one of the best of the 1990's and of all time as well."
18/02/2021,8,"This is most definitely one of Tarantinos best movies ever! It's a movie weaving together a bunch of stories and how they overlap, and what role destiny may play... It offers a bit more smiles than the average Tarantino movie. Basically it's a smart, and unpredictable movie, and you will appreciate it more with every time you see it! And believe me, you WILL see it several times! The cast is spot on, and the soundtrack is, wow! It is, as always with Tarantino, a bit odd, dark and complicated, but with just a tad of humor making it really cool and heavy, and adding that extra dimension to the movie! Overall it's a one of a kind movie, and already a classic, one of those you just have to have seen!"
17/02/2021,8,"This film is great for a number of reasons. The soundtrack is one reason because it's full of classic rock songs that really fit the mood of the scenes in which they appear in. Tarantino does an excellent job at providing non diegetic sound to capture the feel of each scene. The acting is also great in this film. Samuel L Jackson is very scary yet hilarious and you really believe he is the character in real life. The quick cuts and different camera angles Tarantino uses in this film add to the mood of the film. The quick cuts help tell the audience that this is a fast and exciting movie. Overall, i loved this movie and recommend it to anyone and everyone."
13/02/2021,8,"The masterpiece of the non-linear narrative film. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, with wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has beautiful qualities, but they are hopelessly going to darkness and confusion. Each paragraph has no beginning and end, a complementary structure, and the beginning and end are connected, suggesting that the plots in similar movies in reality always happen and never stop.
Line: Why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find a truly special person can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence."
09/02/2021,8,"The movie has its own spirit. The realistic rude behavior every actor pulls in the films makes the movie complete.Warning! Warning! This may destroy some of the experience if you haven´t seen the movie yet. If you already have seen it, check this out! The briefcase Vincent and Jules are going to pick up over at Brad´s place. You know there with the Big Kahuna Burger. The briefcase has a code lock. The code is 666. I don´t know if Tarantino is christian or satanist, but take it as a symbol. Every time somebody sees the content of the briefcase they go, wow! Their eyes are glowing with greed. It´s the temptation. Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) is the devil. Trying to buy Butch Cooligde´s (Bruce Willis) soul or just trying to get him to take a dive in the fight. Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the good man. Sees the shoot-up mistake in Brads place as ""divine influence"". Switch some of the letters in Jules and you get ""Jesul"", close to another name. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the bad man. He denies that there is such power controlling the universe in the ways Jules thinks. Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) is just another human satan uses to tease Vega. Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel) is the demon that frightens the good man. Do you see the posibility, as Jules, or is it just coincedences, as a true Vincent?  Now see the movie again and think of the posibility and make up your point with the movie!"
09/02/2021,8,i don't why people had ranked this movie so high but there is nothing in this movie which is good expect john and Jackman Samuels acting.................this is slowest movie i have ever seen the parts like start with boss wife is not needed..................... when i have seen rating of this movie i was really exited to see it i bought the movie CD when i stated watching movie is good at start it attracts mine interest but after the two stories the third seems much boring and after that the others are also boring and does not make any sense i thought that there will be any suspense in the last part but what i thought was crap so movie is much much below mine expectations.......
04/02/2021,8,I thought the reels were in the wrong order.How anyone would think this weird disaster had any redeeming qualities at all is beyond me.Where's the story line?  Is there any continuity to the plot?  What's the point?
03/02/2021,8,"This is a great example of what happens when you let an artist do their thing.Every frame, every line, every second is a joy to view. The synchronicity is masterful.Lightning, in a bottle."
02/02/2021,8,"Pulp Fiction is an American movie released in 1994 and one of the most impressive films of the 90´s. It´s Quentin Tarantino´s masterpiece and is
categorized as police/suspense. It lasts 1h54 and has the age rating of 18. It was produced by Lawrence Bender and Tarantino himself and the story was written by Tarantino and Roger Avary. Pulp Fiction had a budget of 8 million dollars.
Pulp Fiction was the movie that released Tarantino to the stardom:
Tarantino being the director, screenwriter, producer and actor all together. He was born on March 27, 1963, USA and he achieved fame in the early 90's for his nonlinear scripts.
He loves to use graphic violence, rich dialogues - with a mix of irony and humor - and violence. Pulp Fiction´s main characteristic is the nonlinear narrative,
feature followed by the Brazilian film director Fernando Meirelles in Cidade de Deus. It is a vanguard movie, using and abusing of camera techniques and encompassing movie tricks. It´s a masterpiece that collects high class actors like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackon, Bruce Willis and, Tarantino´s darling, Uma Thurman. The four independent stories, but brilliantly connected by a unique theme of violence, are all magnificent,
bringing up the discussion of violence and moral values. It made Tarantino win the Oscar of best original script besides the Golden Palm in Cannes. The soundtrack - lights on You Never Can Tell by guitar legend Chuck Berry - amplifies the film's immersion into an amazing and nostalgic atmosphere. Pulp Fiction, despite its extreme violence, is a delight to our eyes and ears. So, I dare you! I double dare you to watch the movie!"
31/01/2021,9,"Its not my all time favorite film, but man this is am awesome film for sure. Let's start off with the best thing about this film, the writing. The writing is fantastically well done. Every character has a unique style and it makes them all a whole lot more memorable. The comedy is on point, each bit of comedy is done perfectly hilariously. The action although not a lot is great. Its very bloody and over the top. The basic violence of Tarantino and it is awesomely brutal. The set's are done perfectly too. The 50s diner is amazing to look at. The entire film is done with such a unique style to any film I have ever seen. Overall its a must watch film and I highly recommend this film to everyone who hasn't seen it."
25/01/2021,8,"Now, what can I say about ""Pulp Fiction""? You've all heard of it and may be wondering what all the hype is about. I won't delve into all the details in this review so the best I can do (without spoiling the movie) is to just explain some of the things that were great about it. A noticeable quality about ""Pulp Fiction"" that really struck me (and part of what made it so great)was the dialogue. The dialogue dwells on seemingly pointless subjects, such as what a quarter pounder with cheese is called in France, yet is so encapsulating. 80% of the film is dialogue and surprisingly, it is consistently kept interesting. Whereas in most movies, the dialogue seems to jump around and pass away as the story moves along, the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction"" sets itself up to be played out in future situations(You'll see what I mean) and in this way, Tarantino is able to create many instances of irony and maintain a solid story. In an interview Quentin Tarantino discussed the nonlinear script and explained that if writers can use this format in their books and have such freedom in their storytelling, why couldn't he? How right he is. Tarantino started nothing short of a revolution in the film world by doing so. With the 5 different mini-""stories"" in the film(Jules and Vincent, Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega, the Bonnie Situation, the Diner, and the Golden Watch) Tarantino unravels each of the characters' stories and shows the viewer what happens after and before what appear to be cliché situations. The result is something the likes of which you have never seen before. And not only that, Tarantino was able to intertwine all of the different stories and bring them together into a unified theme, ending with an iconic scene that will leave you speechless. At this point, I must address the complaints of many people who think that ""Pulp Fiction"" is merely a flick that revels in drug use, language, and violence. On the contrary, ""Pulp Fiction"" is essentially a moral story with a strong theme of redemption yet it is told through ""immoral"" characters(hit men, robbers, mob bosses, etc.). Think of all of the great literary pieces in history that were banned and condemned for their immorality but are praised for their genius today! Of course, there's nothing wrong with a good Disney movie for family fun and moral values, but Tarantino's style provides a breath of fresh air to the cinematic community. Not to mention all of the other motifs, plot devices, and iconic scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" is abundant with thrills, chills, and laughs. There is nothing more I can do except to say, get off your butt, go to blockbuster and rent it. ""You won't know the facts until you know the fiction""."
23/01/2021,8,"Most movies, like most novels and musical compositions, have a beginning, a middle, and an end. But a gifted, creative director/writer such as Quentin Tarantino can convolute time and come out with a new kind of animal. And look what James Joyce and the stream of consciousness writers such as William Faulkner did with time in their works. Another great movie ""Momentum"" did it all backwards, starting at the end and ending at the beginning and it worked like magic. When I first rented ""Pulp Fiction"" when it was first released on VHS I watched it late at night and fell asleep right after the Jack Rabbit Slim sequence. When I awoke the story was back on the hit scene with Vincent and Jules still talking about quarter pounders and Big Macs. I thought the tape had rewound itself and so turned off the player. I didn't finish the movie until a few months later. Then I realized Tarantino was merely playing with time. In lesser hands ""Pulp Fiction"" would be too episodic, but Tarantino makes it all work. In the end we have a happy closing knowing that tragedy lies ahead because we have already seen that part in the middle.Vincent and Jules have to be the most garrulous hit men ever to appear in the cinema. They are debating the difference between oral sex and giving a lady a foot massage on their way to a kill. Jules, the spiritually misguided soul, continues to rattle on until eventually told to shut up when they arrive at the cleaners. With Tarantino at the controls all this seems to fit in when the final play is made. This element could have easily degenerated into prattle.Although there are many other levels of interpretation, I see this film as mainly a farce filled with dark humor and pathos, not just a farce on gangster movies in general but on our brave new world, centered on urban decay, corruption, exploitation, and perversion, filled with raw sex, drugs, and violence. The relationship between Butch and his woman points to another direction of love, compassion, and fulfillment. Note also that Butch goes back to help the man who was out to kill him because his morals wouldn't let him leave Marsellus to the rapists just as they wouldn't let him throw a fight. The watch is symbolic of eternal values that rise above the glitter and garishness of the ephemeral. Going back for the watch could have cost Butch his life but it and the values it represents were more important to him. In the end these values win out. Even Vincent has moments of compassion and tenderness, especially when with Mia. Jules almost goes full circle, but the viewer is left with a feeling that he is not totally sincere in his awakening following his brief encounter with death. Butch and his woman seem to be the only two who are able to get completely free from sin city.Each decade has movies that define the era. Think of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" for the 1950's or ""Casablanca"" for the 1940's. For me ""Pulp Fiction"" defines the 90's. All the things that were wrong for America are touched on by Tarantino, yet he provides the means of escape to what America should be. The world of the 90's was almost like a cheap book, or a book of pulp fiction as such a work was called once upon a time, showing the underbelly of urban life but with a way out. There is an exit. Sartre's ""No Exit"" doesn't work here. Redemption is possible, hopefully a more lasting redemption than the one Jules claims to have discovered. All he really has is a suitcase with contents that glitter when opened. Butch has the watch with eternal values.Tarantino wisely uses surf music from the 60's to highlight the gritty life of beach bums, now street bums, who think of themselves as warlords and urban supermen...but, hey, it's all pulp fiction in the end."
16/01/2021,8,"I was very impressed with Pulp Fiction, upon seeing it for the first time recently. Right down to the nitty gritty: Pulp Fiction specializes in sharp and darkly humorous dialog which builds up almost unbearable suspense, culminating in sudden violence. In particular, Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta provide a nearly endless supply of memorable quotes (most of which can't be repeated in polite company). The plot itself is rather fragmented, but fairly easy to follow. The violence can be brutal (in particular, one headshot results in a bloody mess all over a car's back window), but is much more toned down than in Kill Bill, and is relatively infrequent. Unfortunately, the movie whole-heartedly embraces some things that viewers might find offensive. Male Rape makes a brief appearance, as well as an implied torture (which we never see), explicit drug use, and an F-bomb count that I swear exceeds the total number of minutes in the movie.In the end, though, Pulp Fiction ends on a positive note, and doesn't leave you feeling unhappy and dirty. It's a thrill ride from beginning to end, and a brilliant one at that."
13/01/2021,8,"What is Pulp Fiction about? On the surface, it is about several unique people and how their lives connect in some way. The cast of characters includes a boxer (Bruce Willis), two gangsters (John Travolta), their boss (Ving Rhames), and his wife (Uma Thurman). The whole movie consists of several small stories that all connect to each other. One of them involves the two gangsters trying to get rid of a dead body and clean up the mess they've made. Another situation has Travolta taking his boss' wife out on a date, her overdosing on cocaine, and him trying to find a way to save her life. There are other story lines that I won't give away because part of the fun is seeing how everything comes together. But the story is not told in chronological order. It jumps back and forth between stories in a way that would normally be confusing, but the brilliant screenplay makes everything flow nice and smooth.If you like to look at movies for their meaning and artistic value, then you could say that Pulp Fiction is about how people have lost all meaning and value in their lives. Instead of having individuality, people define themselves by what they see in pop culture. The movie has endless references to pop culture and it seems that everything in the movie is inspired by some aspect of pop culture. This is not a lack of originality, but a way to show that everything we do is inspired by something or somebody else. A perfect example is when Bruce Willis' character, Butch, is talking to a Hispanic cab driver who asks him the meaning of his name. He says, ""This is America, honey, our names don't mean sh*t."" To me, the meaning of Pulp Fiction is that each moment has its own priorities. Something might be important to you at one moment in time, but in another not important at all. One minute you could be racking your brain over what you are going to say in your next Facebook status update, and the next you could have a gun in your face. People think they know what is important to them until something else happens that completely changes their priorities. Take, for example, the part where Butch Coolidge sees the man who wants him dead. At one point, they are trying to kill each other, and suddenly one is trying to save the other from getting raped by some psychos in a gun shop. When it is all said and done, they don't even care about why they were fighting in the first place because something bigger and more important is happening.One of the things that makes Pulp Fiction great is that if you don't want to think too much about the deep, philosophical meaning to it, then you can just enjoy the movie for what it is-a humorous, violent, and stylish portrayal of several characters and their encounters with one another. It has a little something for everyone, and the more times you watch it, the more you begin to understand and appreciate it.The genius of the movie comes out in its dialogue. Everything the characters say has meaning or it foreshadows something that is going to happen. For example, when Travolta and Jackson are talking, Travolta says that in France, a quarter pounder with cheese is called a ""royale with cheese."" Soon after, when they are about to do a hit on a few college kids, Jackson asks one of them about the hamburger he is eating. He then uses the ""royale with cheese"" line on him, which leads to one of the funniest conversations in the history of movies.The Academy-Award nominated performance by Samuel L. Jackson creates one of the coolest, funniest, and greatest characters ever. Despite how crazy the whole movie is (and how ridiculous his hair is), we never get the feeling that he is acting. He makes us think that he is a real person and truly believes everything he says. It is very exhilarating to watch how he starts off as a mob hit man with little meaning in his life and transforms into a deeper, more self-aware person.Pulp Fiction is not only the best movie of the '90s, but it is one of the greatest films of all time. Whether you like hilarious comedies, violent action thrillers, or a deeply absorbing drama-you can enjoy it. The first time you watch it, don't try and think too much about it; just watch how the plot unfolds and everything comes together. Watch the funny conversations between Travolta and Jackson, the funky dance scene with Travolta and Thurman, and all of the other moments that make Pulp Fiction a truly memorable movie.http://franklinreviews.blogspot.com/"
13/01/2021,8,"I'm not sure why, but I really loved this film. There is no reason, I just loved it. My sister told me that if I liked ""Kill Bill"" than I should enjoy ""Pulp Fiction"". I noticed that it was also #16 on the top 250. How could I say no to that? I am not a huge Quentin Tarentino fan, to let everyone know. I know there is a huge die hard fans who can't stand if he is bad rapped. I am not one of those people. But! I do think the man has talent that people reconize almost immidatley. All of his films are on the top 250 if you haven't noticed.
The film isn't for everyone. You have to be in a certain mood to watch it. It is pretty sick, so, it's not for everyone. But I would recommend if you love action flicks.10/10"
12/01/2021,8,"The draw for me for this movie was the interwoven storyline and the big name actors like Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman although I'm not a fan of Uma Thurman. No offense to her, she just doesn't draw me in like other actresses do.So it's about these two hit men who have to retrieve a stolen suitcase from some low level criminals. Those criminal's boss is a big level criminal who organizes for Bruce Willis's character Butch Coolidge to throw his next fight. That big level criminal gets one of his lackeys Vincent Vega played by John Travolta to take his wife Mia out dancing and the iconic ""fingers across the eyes in a peace sign"" dance was born.There are many other characters whose lives are interwoven into these characters and to me, that was the fun part, to see how that played out. It's has some famous people (at the time) in smaller roles.There's no real point to this story and it doesn't really have a beginning, or end. It just sort of starts and stops which is off putting to me and why I only gave it 6 stars. What kept me from going lower was the writing and the sort of outlandish characters and scenes that played out, almost at random throughout.While I liked this movie at the time, I don't think I would love it today if it were the first time I saw it. I would still watch it though for the nostalgia of it, but may not recommend it to anyone under 40."
09/01/2021,9,"This film is a classic and a must see for people who want a great plot, a great actor's list and a great movie!! Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken all play in this film brilliantly, with Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and many more playing their part. The Music is truly American and lines that the actors say is truly brilliant. Quentin Tarantino's Greatest film and maybe even the greatest movie of all time. The different story lines that cross make this film exciting and unpredictable. The Camera angles and trademarks of Quentin Tarantino are Great and I think maybe this movie could take over The Godfather one day. A masterpiece, and a must buy for a Complete Collection"

With its non-linear structure, unforgettable characters, and an infectious soundtrack, the film remains an enduring masterpiece that stands as a testament to the power of cinema."
04/01/2021,9,Unpopular opinion but Tarantino is not a cinema director. Every scene he writes is like a sitcom scene where characters argue like little Fonzies' over the dinner table. The movie is entertaining but can only maintain short bursts of plot before moving onto the next argument over a passed out gangster's wife. Travolta is of course Jerry whose comedy/heroin addiction sucks in the female lead Mia/Elaine. Jackson is Kramer with his whacked-out take on life and Willis is of course George who would sacrifice anything for his obsessions. If anyone could put a bullet in Jerry it would be George. My favourite bit is Samuel Jackson's revelatory speech to Tim Roth in the film's final episode. That and the fantastic premature freeze frame on Amanda Plummer that precedes the film's credits.

29/12/2020,8,There are some films that simply change the way we look at people. This is one of those films. Dynamic storytelling. Unapologetic grit. Swagger. This is the movie that inspired me to make films.
25/12/2020,8,"My first memory of Pulp Fiction was when I was very young, and my father had borrowed the soundtrack, and he listened to it. And I still remember listening to the beginning, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogue, followed by Misirlou. I don't have any idea why it had such an impact on me, but I remembered that for so long. And the soundtrack of this film continues to enchant me! There are so many songs in this film that are absolute gold. I already mentioned Misirlou, but one exceptionally beautiful track is Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon by Urge Overkill. I saw Pulp fiction for the first time three years ago. I was sixteen then. But this time I did notice there were several details I missed - or have since then forgotten. It's great how you can watch a film again and it still feels kind of new.I love the colour palette of Pulp Fiction. Especially the colour red is very strong. And I have no complaints about the cinematography whatsoever, it really looks amazing. And the design of many locations is great. I especially love Jack Rabbit Slims, the 50's themed restaurant Mia and Vincent Vega go to. It looks absolutely ridiculous of course, very extravagant, but that's why it's so amazing. It's so detailed.Pulp Fiction sure has it's cult classic reputation. I think almost everyone with Internet has seen pictures and GIFs of Pulp Fiction, even if they haven't seen the film itself. That's why watching the film is weirdly surreal. You know so many scenes, but when they are put together, they are perfect, even if so many scenes are legendary even on their own: Samuel L. Jackson's monologue, The dance scene. Several pieces of dialogue. They are all amazing and so many people know them, but when you see them all in a film, it's... surreal.The characters of Pulp Fiction never seize to amaze me. Like I said about Reservoir Dogs, the characters are closer to people than devices to carry out the story. None of them is a hero, none of them is a villain. They have virtues, they have vices. Of course they are devices for the story, that's what characters do, but even when they do their job for the plot, they still have lives outside of the story. Even if the film doesn't shove their regular life to your face, you can still feel it.Pulp Fiction is good. It is most definitely good, it's amazing. Of course I like to think sometimes that it is completely overrated, but whenever I watch it again - or even see an out-of-context piece of the film, I remember that it is one of the best films ever made."
25/12/2020,8,"This movie is a masterpiece on every level.All the references to McDonalds, the cereal that was discontinued, which Quentin has saved and put into the movie. It is all a piece of American culture. And coming from a guy from Europe, I simply love all that brand stuff. Following criminals in their daily lives, hearing their dialog - is wonderful and it makes for a lot of wit. It is bizarre contrast between murder and funny discussions.The acting. Well I think John Travolta was bad, even tho he got critical acclaim. But Samuel give the performance of his life.The drugs. I like that this movie didn't focus on sex. It feels so cheap. Instead, it depicts a housewife's cocaine use. Classy scenes of injecting top grade heroin. It is all very stylish and really makes the movie sexy, it didn't feel like a cheap trick.It is morbid humor, appealing to all of us mainstream moviegoers, as well as for respected critics."
23/12/2020,7,"This was one of THE best movies I have ever seen! My dad told me about this movie and at first I was reluctant to watch it because it looked old but after the first 10 minuets I was hooked! It does kinda get confusing sometimes but you will defiantly pick up all the parts and by the end of the movie you will understand everything There is a perfect balance of action which includes blood, shooting, and wicked gun fights! Comedy, because lets be honest Samuel Jackson is just down right hilarious. There is a lot of cursing but it fits perfectly with the scenes! I would totally recommend this to all of my friends. Couldn't think of a better way to spend a night then watching this movie! 10/10 would watch again!!"
21/12/2020,7,"Quentin Tarantino knows how to direct an absorbing story and give a movie near-sentient energy of its own. Pulp Fiction is a funny, mysterious, and gorgeously written movie that's a time-capsule for the 90s, like Back to the Future was for the 80s. Pulp Fiction is a darkly humorous, colourful and hard-to-guess story that's still loved to this very day, and for damn good reason: it's a film that has a little bit of something for everyone.Just like nearly every other Quentin Tarantino movie, the story is non-linear, stars Samuel L. Jackson, & pop-music and film references reign supreme in this film. Not to mention the 'Royale with cheese' quote, and 'Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double-dare you motherf##ker, say 'what' one more goddamn time!' This film is basically its own classic moment; from Vince's dance with Mia, to Butch's moment with the Taxi driver, everything is just so well done and just right."
20/12/2020,7,Fresh every single time. Scenes are well put together and took me over 5 times to get them (in my mind) together since the story follows 3 characters. Seen it over 15 times easily.
16/12/2020,7,"Although it describes the life of people at the bottom of society, it does not make people feel as vulgar as its title. This film is very interesting in structure, narrative, theme, soundtrack, and performance. It is an unforgettable gangster movie."
13/12/2020,7,"I am at a complete loss as to what anyone can see in this film. By it's very title it glorifies the days when ""story"" was a cheap and disposable commodity, and seeks to canonise it's lack of a script as a result. I'm sorry - ""anti-art"" has all been done before, and it wasn't very interesting with the dadaists back in 1915 either.Poor acting, a non-existent script, dialogue written by someone who thinks swearing still has ""shock"" value and endless, pointless violence. The burger discussion was the nearest thing to a highlight."
13/12/2020,7,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" not only is a fantastic achievement in film making, it also conjured up such a different perspective of the potential of mainstream Hollywood film. A complex tale of murder, humor and odd characters, suffused with pop-culture references, sharp and witty dialog, fantastic acting, a rollicking soundtrack of multiple different genres and ultimately an intriguing and game-changing story line directed almost flawlessly. There are faults, as in every film, scattered here and there, but they are subtle and even with a scrutinizing eye do not remove you from the experience of sitting and feasting your eyes upon this masterpiece on all fronts. There is very little else that can be said about this film, as everyone and their mothers has seen it, hopefully not together! ""Bring out the gimp."" I envy those cave-dwellers who have yet to see it and I urge you to do so. Right now!"
04/12/2020,8,"After opening his film-making career with the violent, gritty 'Reservoir Dogs' Quentin Tarantino followed it up with 'Pulp Fiction'. Told with a similar, non-linear storyline the latter follows the criminal lives of many characters, some of which intersect by coincidence. Tarantino's style of film-making is often incoherent, messy, and just plain obnoxious. While one can praise his entertainment factor, it's not good enough by itself to make a remarkable film. Such is this case with 'Pulp Fiction' which often relies too much on clever editing, smart acting, and foul language.The film starts off with two lovers talking in a diner: Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer). As they discuss previous criminal jobs, they suddenly decide to hold up the diner they're in. After they get up with guns, declaring their intentions the film goes to freeze frame and the opening credits role. To describe the entire plot of 'Pulp Fiction' would take too long, and is unnecessarily. It follows the lives of two hit men named Jules and Vincent (Academy Award nominees John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), a Mob Boss (Ving Rhames), his oddball wife (Uma Thurman), and a boxer at the end of his prime (Bruce Willis). Intertwined among these criminal characters are a myriad of different personalities. There's the twisted Zed, the classy Winston Wolf, and of course Tarantino himself as Jimmy. These characters often come together through different segments and numerous situations. They include a desperate trip to recover a sacred Golden Watch, a case of someone very important overdosing on Heroine, and a botched getaway from a job. The cast is impressive, featuring smaller roles from the likes of Steve Buscemi, Eric Stoltz, and Christopher Walken. While Tarantino has an impressive cast list to boot, other elements of the film often go wrong.The first thing that comes to mind in Tarantino's films is dialog. He works a labyrinth of different personalities, characters, and events while connecting them with one common theme. The main interaction in 'Pulp Fiction' is violence. It is sporadic, but it comes in bursts of graphic nature. There is, like in 'Reservoir Dogs' comedy mixed in with drama and even action. However, stylistically the combination is lacking. Tarantino ultimately has to use the f-word to establish a certain emotion or mood in his screenplay, rather than relying on directional technique. The cast emotes his dialog to their best of their abilities and the tough build of Jackson is impressive. He gets into his character and fully embodies the hit-man who grows a conscious. The rest of the cast are solid, but Jackson ultimately carries the show with his hilarious delivery and tone.Technically speaking, 'Pulp Fiction' doesn't accomplish anything new. There is interesting editing by Sally Menke, although the photography by Andrzej Sekula looks dated. A good deal of Tarantino's filmography deals more with more with the ""sound"" than the ""look"". There is a fun soundtrack thrown into the mix, but everything looks fairly standard as intended. Tarantino's direction feels off base, mainly because the material he gives himself doesn't really go anywhere. 'Sin City' is an example of a film that is purely based on style and looks, while Tarantino as a filmmaker tries to get a combination of intelligence and entertainment. As these two heads collide, things get messy. Does 'Pulp Fiction' really do anything new for cinema? There's quite a bit of swearing, yes, and the film is looked up to as something out-of-this-world but these are not striking elements. In 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' Tarantino once again heavily copies from other Kung Fu films, but in that regard he is able to create something distinctly entertaining and visually exuberant. The characters in 'Pulp Fiction' are degenerates, people who kill for a living and people who use drugs regularly. Tarantino has made personal remarks that he condemns this sort of behavior, yet the film stylizes both these elements as if there is a bigger mystique to them then there really is.In the end, I give 'Pulp Fiction' more than it's fair share of points. It entertains and it has some solid acting-Tarantino's (lack of) ability to really pull everything together for a solid point ends up being his wrongdoing once again.6/10"
25/11/2020,10,I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and this is surely his major creation! I love the fact that in this film there are many stories that are interweaving so nicely.Surely a Must to see!!
18/11/2020,10,"This is a very interesting movie, full of a strange charm. Although it describes the life of people at the bottom of society, it does not make people feel as vulgar as its title. This film is very interesting in structure, narrative, theme, soundtrack, and performance. It is an unforgettable gangster movie."
16/11/2020,10,"Tarentino does it again, only this time, he created a masterpiece.  Pulp Fiction is a fast paced thrilling ride through the eyes of a wonderful writer/director.  Also, there were Award winning actors such as Travolta and Jackson, who acted superb."
12/11/2020,10,"This movie is wonderful.  It completely met the nearly unrealistic expectations I had for it.  This is one of the few movies I've ever seen that was able to keep my complete attention for more than an hour and a half.  I admit, I haven't seen quite a few of the movies on the top 250 list, but this is, by far, the best movie I've seen so far: A+"
06/11/2020,10,"A very good movie this is,but one sees overtime that Pulp Fiction may be the most overrated movie of all time. Tarantino makes movies for teenagers and in the process takes what he does from other great directors and packages it as his own. This may be a great movie but no, though Tarantino's film may have achieved greatness this not the 9th greatest film of all time. Good, Tarantino may be but as good as he is he is twice as much a narcissistic, arrogant, loquacious,bad man. What I mean is I wouldn't spend my time with Tarantino, not so much because I don't like him, but because I can't stand the smell of his fans and the rest of his crony balogni phonies."
01/11/2020,9,"Long, granted but worth every second. A display of Tarantino's quality as a director and storyteller each segment is compelling and entertaining and even tense but all add up to the bigger picture and show how great the director truly can be when creating his worlds. A great mix of style and substance I highly reccomend this film"
29/10/2020,10,"Sounds weird right ? It really is and what helps this incredible story is Tarantino's non linear storytelling which has been copied several times from this revolutionary movie It simply revolutionized cinema from storytelling to the way of acting, directing, cinematography, etc.. And of course it benefits from Tarantino's Fantastic screenplay and coming off the huge success of the Oscar winning classic reservior dogs, people expected very much from this and it exceeded expectations in a way that people didn't think that was possible And of course 1994 can be called as cinema's best year and this is one of the greatest of all time Tarantino's fast and captivating dialogue made this 2 and half hours feel as if it was 2 and a half minutes The sky is the limit and Tarantino touched the sky and made it as good as it could get with this brilliant work The acting was top notch from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jakson and Uma Thurman in Oscar worthy performances and all were nominated but lost ultimatelyIncredibly well shot cinematography and outstanding directing from Tarantino made the classic that people still talk about 22 years onAnd the most brilliant part is Tarantino's screenplay which won the movie's only Oscar and that surprised me because it deserved so much more Samuel L. Jakson was robbed of an Oscar for best supporting actor and i still don't know how he didn't win it No words can describe what i just witnessed here and really this is a must watch and if you haven't watched it already then you miss so much and it really is one of the greatest everFor me i haven't seen something as brilliant as this since The Shawshank Redemption and The godfather so it is third on my own list"
26/10/2020,10,"Tarantino's crime spree trilogy continues with this epic pop culture underworld caper , A superstar cast with unmatched dialogue material deliver in spectacular fashion as their characters intertwine across a network of criminal activity in a cleverly designed mashed up timeline. Ultra violence and clever humour surround each character as they gate-crash each others lives through happenstance or misfortune were brewing conversations turn into explosive outcomes mostly at the end of a gun barrel , With a 30 yr anniversary looming this movie is still unrivalled and that is an incredible feat. Fantastically entertaining embedded in the top 10 a must see."
20/10/2020,10,"pulp fiction depicts many different stories relatively unlinked apart from a suspicious briefcase and the infamous gangster Marcellus Wallace. The way in which the film was made and filmed firmly placed the legendary Quentin Tarrantino as a talent to look out for and unsurprisingly his many more films in later years didn't disappoint. such films include inglorious bastards, Jackie brown, sin city and kill bill.pulp fiction begins in your average American diner, where Tim Roth (ringo) and Amanda plummer (honey bunny) are discussing new targets to steal from, after a small conversation they conclude that the diner they are in, should be the subject of armed robbery, and so pulp fiction begins, displaying its violent theme from the offset.throughout the rest of the 2 and a half hour film the audience experiences many Effs and Jeffs, thrills, lots of gun fire and a marmite display of the character 'jimmy' (Quentin tarratino. also there is ever present amazing acting performances from Samuel L Jackson (jules Winnfield) john Travolta (vincent Vega) and Bruce willis (butch Coolidge). Pulp fiction deserved many more Oscars than the one it got for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. its a highly entertaining film which deserves many many watches and will go down in movie making history as a classic.Harry Cole"
17/10/2020,10,"I was so looking forward to this movie because I had heard such great things about it. disappointed would be a huge understatement. what the Hell was this movie about? as far as I could tell there was no story, zero, nothing. literally nothing happened. there was no plot, no believable characters, not even a single interesting scene or line of dialog to bump this film up to a 2 in my opinion. just a total and absolute waste of time making and watching this movie. I know movies are subjective, but I just do not get how anyone can find this film remotely entertaining in any way. there are several films in the top 250 I have seen and agree they should be there. this belongs in the bottom 3, along with ""Fargo"" and ""American Beauty""."
17/10/2020,10,"The plot is a little more complicated than usual. The film opens with a couple played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plumber excellently by the way. In fact, there is not a single slacker in the whole film. Soon the viewer begins to realize these two people are up to no good. Then the film cuts to two hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) who are on their way to extract money that a group of college kids owe their boss. Soon, more characters are added to the growing storyline and the intensity level is heightened.The sequences in this film are out of order. This is actually a good thing because the director, Quentin Tarantino(KILL BILL, JACKIE BROWN) doesn't want to show you that part of the story or that character yet. By doing this he is able to take the opportunity to continuously provide a consistent tone and level of humor while at the same time shocking us with unexpected graphic violence. I found this approach to be very stylish and effective in creating genuine emotion.The soundtrack perfectly complements the character's mindsets and the mood of the film. The end result makes for some really very memorable scenes throughout. While the film is basically a crime comedy, the music, in addition to the context of the scenes and the dialogue, are full of personality and classiness. This film is that it isn't for every taste. Sure there are things in this film that any open-minded viewer can admire about it, but the film is very over the top in it's scenes of graphic violence. One scene in particular is a grotesque nod to DELIVERENCE. This film is not for the squeamish. This is the kind of film that can be watched over and over and will always be exciting and fulfilling until the end. It's a modern classic. It's entertaining, brutal, funny, and unforgettable. It's a true classic that has inspired many many films and yet still manages to be just as entertaining as it was in 1994. It holds up perfectly and it's a must-see if you haven't seen it yet."
12/10/2020,10,"Pulp Fiction is, without any doubt, a pillar of the modern cinema, that has so much inspiration and references nice to notice and Tarantino, use these elements to polish his art.Everything was perfect, down to the last-minute details. Samuel L. Jackson had a one in a life actor performance. It was just phenomenal, the way his emotions translate to the screen, his charisma, his voice, it was so good and it's the same thing for John Travolta and Uma Thurman. There is also an iconic soundtrack.On top of that, I think that this movie describes a realistic side of gangsters; it shows us that they are not all bad, that they are human, that they are not invincible, that they enjoy simple things.And of course, that movie got everything, drama, action, adventure, it can also be seen as a race against time with an excellent plot and a mastered pacing.To make it short this movie is unique, iconic and so inspirational."
09/10/2020,10,"After recently re-watching this movie, I am convinced that Tarantino is an expert in the human condition.The characters and nuances of each distinct personality are well worth a third and fourth watch.The stories lead me to believe this is written from real life experiences and perspective. Tarantino uses a strong ""what if we did this"" motif throughout.His writing has a wit and sharp bite that gives it a fill of memorable lines and monologues. While using pop culture references and mundane, topics that show a lack of interest or excitement in the topics, it engages us and makes the characters feel more real and relatable.Blending dark comedy and intense drama, with sudden bursts of violence keep us on edge and holds us in thrall with ""what's next?"""
08/10/2020,10,"This film worries me.  Is it great as so many say?  It's riveting viewing that's for sure.  Movies need to satisfy 5 criteria to be truly great (in my humble opinion): totally committed believable acting, technical excellence, memorable scenes that recur in your mind, something fresh to say or way to say it, and a message at its heart that can change people's lives (hopefully for the better).  This film has the first four in abundance, but fails completely on the fifth.The film is a dazzling kaleidoscope of images, sounds and emotions.It is one of the most vital films of the 90s without a doubt.  Though there is quite a lot of violence, it's less painful to watch than in other movies (e.g. Goodfellas). Rather there's a constant sense of menace, because you know Mr Quentin always has some ultra-violence and jolts to the viewer, and also the non-linear structure means it's more difficult to figure out who's going to get hit.  You get this sense of foreboding right from the off, when the couple are discussing robbing the diner, and the gun goes down on the table with a much louder noise than it should to match the volume of the dialogue.
Best part of the film for me was the dancing sequence - couldn't help thinking so that's how the excellent dancer of Saturday Night Fever ended up!  I have to say that they didn't get proper medical advice for this movie - giving an injection into the heart as for the overdose can't be done through the sternum (breastbone), but it has to go underneath, angled upwards.  I'm pretty sure that giving a slug of adrenaline to someone who's overdosed on cocaine would kill the person instantly rather than wake them up.  And who decided to call the drug adrenaline (its British name) when it's called epinephrine in the US?  I'm left with the impression that this was just another scene that the film makers wanted to include to shock people, rather than trying to make it true to life.  Most worrying aspect is the very graphic depiction of heroin injection. It's made to seem glamorous and seductive.  Anybody trying to get off heroin who watches this movie will have a hard time resisting the impulse to follow the example shown on screen.  I think this particular scene should not have been included in the movie.  Again there's a medical inaccuracy - the blood shown being drawn back into the syringe before injecting is too bright red, that's arterial blood rather than blood from a vein.  Maybe they thought bright red makes it look more vivid (and shocking)?Overall I think this film is worth watching if you know what to expect and like that kind of thing.  However it has an empty heart which makes it fall way short of greatness.  My opinion is that tarantino is very talented in film making, but this takes a back seat compared to his desire to shock people at any cost."

06/10/2020,10,"Pulp Fiction is a very good movie. It deserves to be hailed as one of the best movies ever to be made. Pulp Fiction is sheer entertainment at it's very best. After watching 2/3 of the movie you've got nothing - you've just been watching a reel of historical movie scenes. You haven't got a red line to follow until the last few scenes, where it all comes falling together. You've just been thrilled by the best entertainer of a movie, for 2 hours hour, when the movie makes this genius move, to keep you contemplating for at least another week. No deep meanings here, like in 8 1/2 or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Just a 2 1/2 hour roller coaster, with an infinite amount of riddles. Like Marsellus' neck patch, the weird character that Harvey Keitel plays (The Wolf, problem solver) and the contents of the briefcase. What also strikes you when watching a Tarantino movie is the dialog  I've only seen one director master the art as good  Stanley Kubrick, but that's a different story. This is purely an hail to the movie that made a huge impact on me. The spectacular dialog, and great acting  and not to mention the story ending up in a beautiful circle! Entertaining at it's best! Compliments to Quentin Tarantino!"
05/10/2020,10,"Quentin Tarantino is the used car salesman of Hollywood, and this film is just another previously-owned cheap ride. The glowing suitcase bit was stolen from the 1955 noir film Kiss Me Deadly. Samuel L. Jackson's bible-quoting hitman character was stolen from the 1973 Japanese martial arts film Karate Kiba. Tarantino takes four anecdotes and cuts them out of order to fool the viewer. Tarantino knows his story his boring, so he splatters blood around various sets, uses profanity to an extreme, and regresses to violence befitting of his character. His success is in knowing the vast majority of the public does not watch movies made before their own birthdate, so he can get away with cinematic larceny. At a Hollywood film panel, in 2006, a popular film critic called Tarantino a ""hack"" to which the audience applauded."
15/09/2020,10,"This is the one film that re-writes the book of film-making. Unfortunately Quentin could never and can never repeat such a masterpiece. There are elements of brilliance in his other films but none of them reach the brilliance of each everyday dialogue between the characters that makes it so riveting. So many actors were re-discovered with this movie. John Travolta found that be could be a serious actor outside a music score, Samuel L Jackson found the big break he was destined for, Tim Roth following on from Reservoir Dogs had to be taken seriously across the pond, Bruce Willis must have thanked his stars for featuring in this film without his A-list fee. Ving Rhames Mr big re-rejuvenated his career and this was the sling-shot that catapulted Uma Thurman to fame. nu ff saidEric Stolz played his part to perfection and Harvey Keital was on song."
14/09/2020,10,This movie will forever be one of the best ones out there. Cult classic. Id definitely give this one a watch if you haven't already. So many memorable scenes and characters and you'll end up quoting the movie in your day to day lives.
12/09/2020,10,"I actually like this film a little more than some other R-rated films, including ""Do the Right Thing"". There are more good scenes that I could watch than other R-rated films. However, like ""Do the Right Thing"", this doesn't touch my heart. One bad thing about this film is that there was a bit of violence that I really don't want to see. In terms of the other parts of this film, they are okay, like the fight scene, but they also have some drawbacks. In my opinion, the worst thing about this film is once again some partial nudity. I have never liked seeing some movies that include nudity, starting with ""The Graduate"". But not everything is bad. There are some good parts in this film, including great acting, nice cinematography, and very good lighting effects. The rest of the stuff in the film are like a hit and miss for me. Overall, this is a good film, but it doesn't offer as much comparing to the other films that I reviewed."
30/08/2020,7,"It's the best movie I've ever seen.Pulp Fiction made my believe to the chance stronger.It really exists,I mean luck.The screenplay is wonderful,dialogs are interesting and the characters are understandable.Tarantino's made a miracle that will never be forgotten.Pulp Fiction's incredible dialogs and great acts and informal story,made me not to move until the end.Mr.Director and his movie changed my idea about all the movies I watched after that.There's a dialog throughout the movie from the Holy Bible:""And I will strike down upon thee with the great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.""It may be about me.At first I suspected him and I wanted to poison and destroy his brothers!But he really did it!He revenged me and after he got finished I really felt damned and crushed.I thought Pulp Fiction is not a good one to spend your time and watch it.But it actually cost. I'm sure it was one of the movies that its beginning was the end of it.Or in better language,it was one of the first postmodern movies.Take it easy. How can your luck be bad?This movie has lots of bad chances.Your boss's wife overdoses and is dying on you and this thing must be unknown.What will you do?You get out of the toilet and see your enemy is standing right at opposite of you and wants to kill you with your own gun.Or you're talking to your friend and he's sitting at the car's behind seat.You look at him during the talk and your pistol's in your hand,suddenly your gun takes the shot by itself.You haven't shot the legs,hands,or even the chest;You've shot straight at your friend's head!And when you wake up,you've taken s--t in the car and it's full of blood and skull pieces.What will you do to hide from the cops?There are many things like this.Well it's great.Enjoy the acts and screenplay.Some dialogs are so funny some are about bad things.Pulp Fiction is a real pulp fiction.PULP FICTION IS THE LORD."
08/08/2020,7,"Like most people, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Pulp Fiction' and found it to be a refreshing change to the predictable and stereotypical drama/action movies we are used to seeing. 'Pulp Fiction' rips up the rule book and completely rewrites it.The film is bizarre, but not in a way that disillusions the audience. Instead, it's thoroughly gripping and demands attention. The dialogue is probably the best part of the film, you could tell from the opening scene alone that this is no ordinary dialogue and no ordinary movie.Good stuff, kept me entertained for the full 2hr 30m run time. Not a film I would consider among the best I have ever seen, but a refreshingly unique movie that I would happily watch again."
06/08/2020,7,When I seen Rocky I felt like I wish I could do that (Make movies.) When I seen Pulp Fiction I was like I have to find away to do that. It's an ADHD brain at it's finest. I believe Jules is the every man character you know anyone whoever wanted more out of their life. Although Butch plays a similar part he's stuck in the chaos. What's in the case is? Hope. Hope for a new life walking the earth and such.
04/08/2020,7,"Pulp Fiction is a great movie, it takes everything you know about movies, and throws it away and it absolutely works! The cast is amazing, the scrip is one of the best ever written and in the first time you watch it you may not understand the timeline of the movie but it's pretty complicated but if you're watching the movie carefully, you will understand the timeline and everything just like i did, I totally recommend this movie to anyone beyond the ago of 14, I know it's rated R but kids after the ago of 14 will totally understand what's happening, but you must be mature enough to watch this movie, there are a lot of intense scenes in the movie."
04/08/2020,7,"Some scenes that totally worth it to watch this movie over and over. the scene of the blood with the H, when Mia is OD, when Travolta and Mia are talking about a relationship and then started to dance, it is just amazing how Quentin Tarantino could reach that level of movie, one of the biggest movies of all times with i think Reservoir Dogs.I could recommend this film to almost everybody and i think everyone could fall in love with this movie. In the other hand the soundtrack is amazing i love it all especially those sad songs like Lonesome Town, If Love was a red dress. And the way the actors get into the character is very cool"
27/07/2020,9,"Vincent: And you know what they call a... a... a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris? Jules: They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese? Vincent: No man, they got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the f--k a Quarter Pounder is. Jules: Then what do they call it? Vincent: They call it a ""Royale"" with cheese. Jules: A ""Royale"" with cheese! What do they call a Big Mac? Vincent: A Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it ""le Big-Mac"". Jules: ""Le Big-Mac""! Ha ha ha ha! What do they call a Whopper? Vincent: I dunno, I didn't go into Burger King.Directed by Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction a ""cool"" movie directed beautifully by Tarantino.Jules: Oh! F--k's happening! Vincent: Man, I shot Marvin in the face. Jules: Why the f--k did you do that! Oh man I've seen some crazy ass s--t in my time! Vincent: Chill out, man. I told you it was an accident. You probably went over a bump or something. Jules: Hey, the car didn't hit no motherf---ing bump. Vincent: Hey, look man, I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch! The gun went off. I don't know why. Jules: Well look at this f---ing mess, man. We're on a city street in broad daylight. Vincent: I don't believe it. Jules: Well believe it now, motherf---er! We gotta get this car off the road. You know cops tend to notice s--t like your driving a car drenched in f---ing blood.The performances are excellent, the editing is as excellent, and the dialogue is crisp and cool!""The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright. He'd be damned if any of the slopes were gonna get their greasy yellow hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something: his ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.""The only flaw this picture contains is the Bruce Willis scenes! Those scenes were a let down. However, the only scene featuring Willis which I enjoyed was the one were him and Ving were in the basement of the gun shop!Regardless what makes this movie work are the characters of Vincent and Jules played by John Travolta and Sam Jackson.3 1/2(***1/2)out of 4(****)stars"
27/07/2020,9,This is one of the most original movies of our time. Completely unique form of directing and editing. Storyline is very engaging and entertaining. Keeps you on your toes at all times throughout the movie.
26/07/2020,9,"I absolutely love this movie!  The first time I saw it, I thought it was excellent, but I didn't really get a good taste of it until watching it two more times.  It's the type of movie you just have to see more than once, because of all the plot twists and turns.  Tarantino's dialogue is great, and the acting is downright amazing.  SAMUEL JACKSON IS UNBELIEVABLE.  I really like this movie."
26/07/2020,9,"I do not understand the hype. This movie was nothing but a waste of my time.Why? First, I believe a movie should have a clearly outlined plot so that you know what's going on. This movie doesn't feature that. It starts out of nowhere with no apparent background and has a pointless ending.There are indeed a couple of scenes that might be fun to watch if you are in the ""right mind"" (however most are violent and immature) and the actors do an excellent performance but that doesn't pump this movie up to anything good. It kind of shows you the happenings of a few drugdealers and criminals within a short timeframe, that's all.To sum it up... this movie has few redeeming qualities. Do something productive and more fun instead. Such as washing the dishes.Two stars out of ten."
22/07/2020,9,"Personally I think Quentin Tarantino is a lunatic, but a creative, unusual, unique, (ok I can think of at least 20 more adjectives)writer/director, and yes, even a VERY good actor. He has never made a movie (to my knowledge) the he did not either have a supporting role or a cameo. ""From Dusk 'till Dawn"" he made a brilliant move with Cheech playing three roles. As 'Jimmy' he was an actor of the highest caliber. Brought back Travolta for a mere $450,000, a STEAL but a good business move. Quentin wrote the storyline to ""Natural Born Killers"" just before he wrote the screenplay of Pulp Fiction. Convinced Producers to give him an $8 million budget, that returned over $100,000,000 in North America and when you count world-wide it doubles. I think Kill Bill Vol. 3 is going to be very good."
