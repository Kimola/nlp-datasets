# Training Sets
You can use the repositories containing training sets for the models you will create at **Kimola** or in your own projects. This repository includes datasets made up of audience reviews for two different films. We tried to make these datasets as unique as possible for you. Movie lovers, I know you're here! üé¨üçø
## Back To The Future Movie Sets
We took the viewer comments on imdb for the movie back to the future 1 and analyzed them with Kimola. As a result of our analysis, there are 3 columns on the sets of the movie back to the future. The first column is the date the comment was made, the 2nd column is the score given to the movie, and the 3rd column is the viewer comments. If you are a back to the future viewer, you will love this set. You may want to watch back to the future before you finish your work on the sets, be careful!
## Pulp Fiction Movie Sets
We took the audience comments made on IMDB for the Pulp movie and analyzed them with Kimola. As a result of our analysis, there are 3 columns on the sets of the Pulp Fiction movie. The first column is the date the comment was made, the 2nd column is the score given to the movie, and the 3rd column is the audience comments. I think I'll go watch Pulp Fiction for the 100th time when I'm done here!
