## Pulp Fiction Movie Reviews Sets
We thought, thought and thought some more... Which movie set would dataset users want to create their reports with? I had thought of the movie "Shrek" but I had doubts that the average age of the Kimola team would not like my idea because the animation movie idea was a bit too old. Then our whole thinking process ended with the Pulp Fiction movie idea. Sorry dear Shrek, please live your life in your swamp instead of me! (sad face emoji...) Dear movie lovers, I have prepared different sized sets for you to create your reports with Pulp Fiction datasets. Enjoy using the datasets consisting of [50](https://github.com/Kimola/nlp-datasets/blob/main/imdb-reviews/Pulp%20Fiction%20(Movie)%20-%20Imdb%20Reviews%20(50).csv), [100](https://github.com/Kimola/nlp-datasets/blob/main/imdb-reviews/Pulp%20Fiction%20(Movie)%20-%20Imdb%20Reviews%20(100).csv), [250](https://github.com/Kimola/nlp-datasets/blob/main/imdb-reviews/Pulp%20Fiction%20(Movie)%20-%20Imdb%20Reviews%20(250).csv), [500](https://github.com/Kimola/nlp-datasets/blob/main/imdb-reviews/Pulp%20Fiction%20(Movie)%20-%20Imdb%20Reviews%20(500).csv) and [1,000](https://github.com/Kimola/nlp-datasets/blob/main/imdb-reviews/Pulp%20Fiction%20(Movie)%20-%20Imdb%20Reviews%20(1000).csv) comments.
