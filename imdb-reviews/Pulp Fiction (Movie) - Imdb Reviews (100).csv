"Oct 17, 2024",10,"absolutely fantastic music, and directorial genius, anyone who thinks otherwise obviously did not understand it. Witty dialogue and intelligent storyline and definet for true movie lovers, fantastic script with impeccable timing and well acted, a truly incredible movie. an unpredictable storyline that will take the viewer by surprise, a twisted and juggled plot to leave you thinking about the movie. watching this movie will leave you wanting more of tarentino's writing and directorial work, ( see reservoir dogs, kill bill etc). this movie will make you think and is not for the faint hearted and does not involve any seedy special effect to draw attention away from this impeccably written story and nothing else to say except this movie deserves full marks in every category"
"Apr 29, 2024",5,"Pulp Fiction rules. It is one of the pinnacles of cinema. But for all the people who like to spoil the fun by asking the question why, here's why: excellent performances (especially Samuel L. Jackson & John Travolta as a pair of hit men), fun characters and possibly the greatest screenplay of all time. For anyone who hasn't seen Pulp Fiction, watch it. For those who have seen it, watch it again and revisit Butch, Jules, Vincent, Mia, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. Thank you, Quentin.Relive one of the greatest films of all time 10/10. Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Frequent Language, Strong Drug Use and Some Very Disturbing Sexual Content."
"Apr 15, 2024",4,"This is independent film-making at its finest, with the best ensemble cast to have possibly ever graced the silver screen.  Tarantino will never equal this.  Jackie Brown, being a pretty good flick seemed totally crap having been Tarantino's long awaited return after this jem.  Samuel Jackson plays his best role to a tee here.  A clear 10/10"
"Mar 2, 2024",3,"Every time I watch this movie, I get reminded why they call Quentin Tarantino a master of dialogue. It is a shockingly smart and original movie all the way through. Every actor does a tremendous job at delivering quotable yet realistic lines. It is very tough to decide which scene is the best. The burger scene? The ending scene? The overdose? The escape from the rapists? I guess I will never know which one I prefer, and that, is what makes this film truly iconic."
"May 31, 2023",3,"I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do."
"May 27, 2023",3,"Color me stupid but I thought ""Pulp Fiction"" sucked. Being creative is easy when there are no rules...as in fantasies and cartoons and, well, pulp fiction. Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several  years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, ""Pulp..."" -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting. Why no T&A???"
"May 26, 2023",3,"Ill go on record and claim that Pulp Fiction is probably the best motion picture Ive ever seen. After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not. Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry. Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible. Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good. If you havent seen this, rent it, watch it and enjoy it. Its one hell of a ride.***** out of ******"
"May 23, 2023",3,"Inspired by true events, a true story, masterful, twisted and bent Quentin Tarantino with a crowd of brilliant talent that destroys essential life to promote egotistic nepotism; in short stunning and sensational. Pulp Fiction has a timeless addiction that pervades the veins and makes the heartbeat faster... Why 9? Whine and wine again... there's something special about being inglorious... and years later Quentin is still pumping the fiction and mashing the pulp. This film has insights looking both backward and forward ... a reel show of American ideology that alludes to foreign infiltration of the system. How can one not love Pulp Fiction? From one of America's most controversial film directors who does not shy away or shudder in fear, a man who tackles complex thematic material head on, in overt gritty chains... and has managed to unchain the bleeding heart flicker by flicker."
"May 21, 2023",3,"Pulp Fiction doesn't have a plot. Or, it doesn't have a linear and evolving plot. Instead, it is just a collection of relatively unrelated stories that include some of the same characters. However, what makes this crime movie special is these stories aren't about the dangerous life and business of a gangster, but instead about just the day to day life of people who happen to be employed by the mob. Now, at first this may seem boring and pointless, but after a closer look, you'll realize that there is one thing about these stories that stands out. The dialogue. Every conversation is unrealistically realistic. People will go on long debates and monologues about everything from french burgers, the metric system, foot massages, tasty burgers, refreshing beverages, why some guy got thrown out of a window because of a foot massage, divine intervention, good coffee, comfortable silences, and just walking the Earth. Every conversation seems like an exaggeration of a conversation you might have. This is only made better by the intermittent action and violence that occurs, which only adds to the complete absurdity that makes this movie so great.Pulp Fiction is one of funniest, most interesting, and most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. 100/100. An absolutely necessary watch."
"May 14, 2023",3,"I can certainly respect this movie. As a form of art it is fantastically unique and masterfully eclectic. It is the epitome of a postmodern film - with no conventional story structure, no central conflict, no clear moral, achronological 'storytelling', and so on. It definitely needs to be appreciated for its incredible style.But as with most postmodernist art, tossing aside everything that makes traditional art good sure stands out as bold and unique, but it comes with its negatives. And unlike most reviewers I don't think being 'unique' is a sufficient substitute for being devoid of the traditional things that make a film good.For instance, this movie does not have great pacing. Partially a result of the lack of (conventional) plot development and story structure, but also partially a result of the often (deliberately) mundane dialogue. I realize postmodern art can often be very self-referential, but I personally can't see why a lot of this dialogue had to exist. It doesnt immerse you, it doesnt engage you, or advance the plot... its usually not even funny. So whats the point?But what is the point in general? Pulp fiction meanders around without really giving any core messages. Perhaps right at the end in the epilogue scene, it says something meaningful and ties at least some of the themes together quite well. And masterful as Tarantino is, the scene is just ambiguous enough to keep people talking about what exactly it means.So yes, this is a great movie to analyze and critique, but its missing too many ingredients that make a story great to experience."
"May 11, 2023",3,"Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and really a unique film by classic Quentin Tarantino. Quentin Tarantino is one of the best director and his all movie kept you engage from starting to end. He is a genius and believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable.Pulp Fiction is an iconic masterpiece that redefined American cinema. Known for its nonlinear narrative, razor-sharp dialogue, and eclectic mix of humor and violence, the film weaves together multiple interconnected stories centered around the Los Angeles criminal underworld.This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone and all the actors give their career best performance.The ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .""Pulp Fiction"" explores themes of redemption, loyalty, violence, and the blurred lines between good and evil. It confronts these heavy subjects with dark humor and a self-awareness that challenges traditional genre conventions.""Pulp Fiction"" remains a landmark in cinema history, praised for its innovation, audacity, and lasting impact on popular culture. It continues to captivate audiences with its unforgettable characters, memorable scenes, and Tarantino's singular vision, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films ever made.So, if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It's movie which filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, and great soundtracks. This movie is just a spectacular experience.10/10🔥"
"May 2, 2023",3,"This film was a wild one. Definitely blew my earlier expectations of it out of the water. The way in which it is told is brilliant, with non-linear, seemingly random, disjointed plot lines, that all come together and manage to tell a story of their own. It's an extremely violent, drug filled, dirty, gritty, crazy film about crime, but it's also full of great, witty, and intelligent dialogue and it's full of minute things and details you may not pick up on at first. It was an entertaining and darkly humorous film, but it's also an intelligent and revolutionary one that broke new ground, that I'd definitely recommend watching it at least once."
"Apr 18, 2023",4,Every Terintino film I've ever seen has been awesome. This is no exception. The movie is so good and just interesting he has like four stories and ends up connecting every single one. The movie is super intense at parts and then really funny at others. The part where Sam L. Jackson takes that guys big kahuna burger and is questioning him is so tense since you know he isn't making it out alive. Also one my hands down favorite parts in a movie ever is when John Travolta's gun goes off in the car and he's just like ah man I just shot Marvin in the face like it was just a little slip up. The guys head exploded h=in his car! Anyway incredible movie definitely watch.Also if you didn't know there is a theory that was confirmed by Terintino That all his films are connected.
"Apr 18, 2023",4,"Well I had heard a lot about this movie earlier but after seeing it I can only say that it is a below average movie. I mean the only thing I enjoyed was some dialogs (although most of them were out of context)and nice editing job.But the story ,if there was one was plain boring .Acting was OK except Samuel who was great. I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke. Also Bruce Willis part was half baked and had very little significance for the story.So overall this movie which is a ""so called classic"" disappoints because bits of comedy like the Bonnie situation are not enough to make a movie classic."
"Mar 25, 2023",3,"Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success."
"Aug 21, 2022",6,"this movie is painfully overrated: every time someone tells me that pulp fiction is their favorite movie of all time, I die a little bit inside. Mind you, it's not a terrible movie, it has style and memorable moments, but nothing THAT great that justifies the hype among these pseudo intellectuals. You know the type: these college kids who just love Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, probably jerk off to Bukowski's poetry, think Kubrick is THE GREATEST DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME, absolutely LOVE to bash religion and make sure everyone knows they're an atheist, and yet still manage to think they're better than you. The sad thing about Pulp Fiction is that I used to enjoy it when I was younger, wasn't my favorite movie of all time, but was definitely on the top 10. Watching it now, having endured thousands of these guys and their egos, left me bitter and annoyed. I realized that I didn't even speak all that much about the movie, sorry about that, I'm just salty."
"Aug 20, 2022",6,"The movie features a non-linear narrative structure, interweaving several different storylines that revolve around the Los Angeles criminal underworld. The film has an amazing cast which includes John Travolta, Uma Thurman, and Samuel L. Jackson, who deliver electrifying performances that are both humorous and suspenseful.I've rated Pulp Fiction a 10 out of 10 as its sharp dialogue, stylish direction, and iconic soundtrack make it a feast for the senses each time I've watched it, and I can't deny the cultural impact its had on the art of cinema. Despite its violent subject matter, its a wildly entertaining and smart film that remains just as fresh and relevant today as it was when it was first released in 94. If you're a fan of innovative filmmaking, great music, and unforgettable characters, then Pulp Fiction is the movie for you!"
"Mar 17, 2022",2,"I think the genius of pulp fiction comes in its ability to take multiple unique stories and weave them together perfectly through unconventional means. It can be argued that the chapters of the film work independently, but when put in an ensemble, each one gives us a peak into a world that feels lived in and larger than what we're presented with, at the same time, Pulp Fiction still changes the audiences perspective of the world it takes place in with each subsequent chapter while still feeling like the world we were introduced to in the very first scene. The chapters are famously unchronological and I believe it's a testament to Quentin Tarantino's creative genius and skills as a writer that a lot of its potency and impact as a film can be accredited to its unconventional sequence. Its a film about perspective, at least that's what I took from it, and I appreciate how the only real ""point"" or ""message"" it has is precisely that anyone can come to a conclusion about it, much like the theories revolving around the contents of the briefcase that pushes the plot forward in the first place."
"Dec 20, 2021",7,"Amazing movie. This should not be a good movie but it is. It's a simple story divided into 3 chapters, all occurring at different times in the story. Samuel L Jackson is so good in this movie. Bruce Willis is also great along with the rest of the cast. I was laughing the whole way through the movie. There were some great action sequences and intense moments."
"Jul 28, 2021",9,"This movie, despite the fact that I have now seen it more than 20 times, never gets old and certainly never fails to impress. The actors show just how talented they are and how much they are capable of. The scenes might seem to not make sense in the order they are in during the first time you watch it, but I assure you that after a second or maybe even third time everything will fall into place and amaze you. This movie basically has no flaws and demonstrates how amazing the art of cinematography can be.Many people underestimate the skill and class it takes to create such a movie but it is blindingly obvious that this film belongs in the top 100 best movies of all time in everyone's mind.This is my opinion on the film, it might seem overrated to you because i am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, but this movie left my mouth wide open and i cannot do otherwise but recommend it."
"May 18, 2021",2,"Pulp fiction is one of the best crime/ dramatic movie of my time. The movie had such a great cast, and some intense dramatic scene pretty much through the whole movie. I remember not liking this movie when I was a kid, but now that I am older I really enjoy watching this film. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie but the most memorable scene I think was when Uma Thurman and John Travolta are dancing on stage at the restaurant to "" You never can tell"" by Chuck Berry. Another famous and great scene is Samuel L Jacksons speech hes giving to the guy while shooting every one else. A lot of action shots in this film, drugs, guns, and violence. A very brilliantly shot film."
"May 17, 2021",2,"It may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'Pulp Fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. Yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, I would imagine - stand the test of time. But is it for everyone?It's Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and I'd agree). However, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? I guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. It's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. Confused? Stick with it. It's worth it.If you check out the main poster associated with 'Pulp Fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of Uma Thurman's character to sell it. Even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and - of course - Samuel L Jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). This is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. However, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance.'Pulp Fiction' has made it's mark on not only the Box Office and takings, but also on popular culture. It's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in.Due to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. And it's all the better for it. This is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. For all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. You can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your Instagram account on your phone. You really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. Because of that it's not for idle viewers. It's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!).If you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'Pulp Fiction' a little hard to watch. However, even if you're not sure about it, I would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. Plus, as I've eluded to, Samuel L Jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. They don't make them like this any more. Even Tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here."
"May 17, 2021",2,"You cannot resist watching a movie with Uma Thurman, Samuel Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken, plus you definitely cannot resist watching a movie directed and part written by Quentin Tarantino. So, nuff said, one of the all time iconic must see movies."
"May 7, 2021",2,"This movie is amazing. I love Tarantino. I love violence. I love this movie. This movie is so freaking good that i could talk about it for hours. It was not the first Tarantino movie i saw, nor the 2nd,3rd, or 4th but it should have been. I now know why this movie is so well known. The cinematography is awesome and the whole look of the film in general is an experience to see. The really cool thing about this movie is that its shot out of chronological order. The scenes are completely all over the place. They do not go in order. Its different and could confuse you but i was still able to pick up on the movie and what was going on because all though none of the scenes were shot in order they all connect to each other a little bit in a way. I think that the way its shot out of chronological order makes the movie awesome and unique. I've seen a number of movies shot out of chronological order but this one is the best in my opinion. Im not lying when i say everything about this movie is a freaking trip! Its got an insanely good cast starring in it and it has a lot of violence. Love this movie. Tarantino never disappoints me."
"May 5, 2021",2,"This is the movie which has one of the most briliant Hungarian dub - which of coruse does not give back everything perfectly, but... just briliant, the original and the hugnarian dub as well."
"Apr 14, 2021",4,"From what I gather, and my own reaction, people either love this movie or hate it. Strangely, I have been on both sides of the fence with this film. I never look at it in the same light, for some reason. At first I hated it and on a second chance, really liked it. Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.This is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?Two things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest. With 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all."
"Mar 24, 2021",2,"This is indeed the best movie I have ever seen. I don't know how people actually hate it. It's a totally original movie, its got everything from violence to extreme profanity. this in my opinion gets a 10/10 for sure."
"Mar 19, 2021",2,"This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB."
"Mar 13, 2021",2,"The movie is a classic, without a doubt. Its very entertaining and features fantastic acting and writing. The movie however, does not have the most powerful meaning its more something that you watch for fun. I must also admit that Quentin Tarantino's style is not my cup of tea. However, I still have to respect the ingenuity of which this film has been made."
"Mar 11, 2021",2,"I must average viewing this flick around six times per year. Every two months -- yeah, that sounds about right. Are there really any other films out there with legendary scene after legendary scene after legendary scene? Maybe, but not on the same scale as Pulp Fiction.Who hasn't seen this already? I mean, really? Do these people exist?WATCH THIS FILM!THEN WATCH IT AGAIN!AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN!YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH!"
"Feb 23, 2021",8,"""Pulp Fiction"" is an absolute masterpiece that revolutionized the crime genre. With its non-linear storytelling and unforgettable characters, Quentin Tarantino crafts a cinematic experience like no other. The film oozes with style, from the iconic dialogue to the killer soundtrack. The performances by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman are nothing short of brilliant. The dark humor and unexpected twists keep you on the edge of your seat. Tarantino's expert direction and attention to detail make every scene a work of art. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a wild ride filled with violence, wit, and memorable moments. It's a must-watch for any film lover looking for a bold and unconventional masterpiece. 🎥🔫✨"
"Feb 22, 2021",8,talk about a Lousy movie.. this one was Ridiulous !! i couldnt understand it at All .. i only watched half of it.. [the part with Bruce Willis] and soon as that was over i re-wound it .. talk about a waste of good money..and why would all the actors in this movie want to be associated with such junk ?? what were they thinking ??? it sure confused the heck out of me thats for sure.. i cant see what the big deal was with this sorry excuse for a movie.. it is a waste of film and a waste of the actors times as i see it... i would advise someone not to use their hard earned money on this drivel.. rent something else instead of this turkey !!
"Feb 21, 2021",8,"At the beginning of the film, right before it starts, there is a definition of the two words that make up the title of this film. One word that should have been defined is the word classic. If you ask me what my definition of a classic film is, it is one that is easily remembered, whether that be by memorable quotes, characters or scenery and thoroughly enjoyable to the point where you will want to see it on a regular basis. I could go on and on about all of that but I will say this is one film that has changed the way I see films. It has become one of my all time favourites as a result. As soon as I started watching it the first time, I knew this was something special. I cannot even tell you how many times I have watched it but I always remember the witty dialogue, the violence, characters, etc. Even thought it is officially defined as a crime/drama film, I can't help but find a few of the scenes as side splitting hilarious. I see perfection as a bit of a myth but to me, Pulp Fiction is as close as it comes to a perfect film. The casting of the roles is very good, in particular, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman, script writing is fantastic, not just because of the witty dialogue but due to Quentin Tarantino being brave by telling this story in a non-traditional, non-linear fashion. Kudos also to Tarantino's direction, showing why he is one of the best modern Hollywood directors out there. Speaking of kudos, I think Pulp Fiction's legacy has grown since being released in 1994 and should have won at least two more Academy Awards, namely Samuel L. Jackson as Best Supporting Actor and Quentin Tarantino as Best Director. Nevertheless, it has truly stood the test of time and is one of the best of the 1990's and of all time as well."
"Feb 2, 2021",8,"Pulp Fiction is an American movie released in 1994 and one of the most impressive films of the 90´s. It´s Quentin Tarantino´s masterpiece and is
categorized as police/suspense. It lasts 1h54 and has the age rating of 18. It was produced by Lawrence Bender and Tarantino himself and the story was written by Tarantino and Roger Avary. Pulp Fiction had a budget of 8 million dollars.
Pulp Fiction was the movie that released Tarantino to the stardom:
Tarantino being the director, screenwriter, producer and actor all together. He was born on March 27, 1963, USA and he achieved fame in the early 90's for his nonlinear scripts.
He loves to use graphic violence, rich dialogues - with a mix of irony and humor - and violence. Pulp Fiction´s main characteristic is the nonlinear narrative,
feature followed by the Brazilian film director Fernando Meirelles in Cidade de Deus. It is a vanguard movie, using and abusing of camera techniques and encompassing movie tricks. It´s a masterpiece that collects high class actors like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackon, Bruce Willis and, Tarantino´s darling, Uma Thurman. The four independent stories, but brilliantly connected by a unique theme of violence, are all magnificent,
bringing up the discussion of violence and moral values. It made Tarantino win the Oscar of best original script besides the Golden Palm in Cannes. The soundtrack - lights on You Never Can Tell by guitar legend Chuck Berry - amplifies the film's immersion into an amazing and nostalgic atmosphere. Pulp Fiction, despite its extreme violence, is a delight to our eyes and ears. So, I dare you! I double dare you to watch the movie!"
"Dec 23, 2020",7,"This was one of THE best movies I have ever seen! My dad told me about this movie and at first I was reluctant to watch it because it looked old but after the first 10 minuets I was hooked! It does kinda get confusing sometimes but you will defiantly pick up all the parts and by the end of the movie you will understand everything There is a perfect balance of action which includes blood, shooting, and wicked gun fights! Comedy, because lets be honest Samuel Jackson is just down right hilarious. There is a lot of cursing but it fits perfectly with the scenes! I would totally recommend this to all of my friends. Couldn't think of a better way to spend a night then watching this movie! 10/10 would watch again!!"
"Dec 21, 2020",7,"Quentin Tarantino knows how to direct an absorbing story and give a movie near-sentient energy of its own. Pulp Fiction is a funny, mysterious, and gorgeously written movie that's a time-capsule for the 90s, like Back to the Future was for the 80s. Pulp Fiction is a darkly humorous, colourful and hard-to-guess story that's still loved to this very day, and for damn good reason: it's a film that has a little bit of something for everyone.Just like nearly every other Quentin Tarantino movie, the story is non-linear, stars Samuel L. Jackson, & pop-music and film references reign supreme in this film. Not to mention the 'Royale with cheese' quote, and 'Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double-dare you motherf##ker, say 'what' one more goddamn time!' This film is basically its own classic moment; from Vince's dance with Mia, to Butch's moment with the Taxi driver, everything is just so well done and just right."
"Dec 20, 2020",7,Fresh every single time. Scenes are well put together and took me over 5 times to get them (in my mind) together since the story follows 3 characters. Seen it over 15 times easily.
"Oct 20, 2020",10,"pulp fiction depicts many different stories relatively unlinked apart from a suspicious briefcase and the infamous gangster Marcellus Wallace. The way in which the film was made and filmed firmly placed the legendary Quentin Tarrantino as a talent to look out for and unsurprisingly his many more films in later years didn't disappoint. such films include inglorious bastards, Jackie brown, sin city and kill bill.pulp fiction begins in your average American diner, where Tim Roth (ringo) and Amanda plummer (honey bunny) are discussing new targets to steal from, after a small conversation they conclude that the diner they are in, should be the subject of armed robbery, and so pulp fiction begins, displaying its violent theme from the offset.throughout the rest of the 2 and a half hour film the audience experiences many Effs and Jeffs, thrills, lots of gun fire and a marmite display of the character 'jimmy' (Quentin tarratino. also there is ever present amazing acting performances from Samuel L Jackson (jules Winnfield) john Travolta (vincent Vega) and Bruce willis (butch Coolidge). Pulp fiction deserved many more Oscars than the one it got for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. its a highly entertaining film which deserves many many watches and will go down in movie making history as a classic.Harry Cole"
"Oct 17, 2020",10,"I was so looking forward to this movie because I had heard such great things about it. disappointed would be a huge understatement. what the Hell was this movie about? as far as I could tell there was no story, zero, nothing. literally nothing happened. there was no plot, no believable characters, not even a single interesting scene or line of dialog to bump this film up to a 2 in my opinion. just a total and absolute waste of time making and watching this movie. I know movies are subjective, but I just do not get how anyone can find this film remotely entertaining in any way. there are several films in the top 250 I have seen and agree they should be there. this belongs in the bottom 3, along with ""Fargo"" and ""American Beauty""."
"Oct 17, 2020",10,"The plot is a little more complicated than usual. The film opens with a couple played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plumber excellently by the way. In fact, there is not a single slacker in the whole film. Soon the viewer begins to realize these two people are up to no good. Then the film cuts to two hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) who are on their way to extract money that a group of college kids owe their boss. Soon, more characters are added to the growing storyline and the intensity level is heightened.The sequences in this film are out of order. This is actually a good thing because the director, Quentin Tarantino(KILL BILL, JACKIE BROWN) doesn't want to show you that part of the story or that character yet. By doing this he is able to take the opportunity to continuously provide a consistent tone and level of humor while at the same time shocking us with unexpected graphic violence. I found this approach to be very stylish and effective in creating genuine emotion.The soundtrack perfectly complements the character's mindsets and the mood of the film. The end result makes for some really very memorable scenes throughout. While the film is basically a crime comedy, the music, in addition to the context of the scenes and the dialogue, are full of personality and classiness. This film is that it isn't for every taste. Sure there are things in this film that any open-minded viewer can admire about it, but the film is very over the top in it's scenes of graphic violence. One scene in particular is a grotesque nod to DELIVERENCE. This film is not for the squeamish. This is the kind of film that can be watched over and over and will always be exciting and fulfilling until the end. It's a modern classic. It's entertaining, brutal, funny, and unforgettable. It's a true classic that has inspired many many films and yet still manages to be just as entertaining as it was in 1994. It holds up perfectly and it's a must-see if you haven't seen it yet."
"Jul 27, 2020",9,This is one of the most original movies of our time. Completely unique form of directing and editing. Storyline is very engaging and entertaining. Keeps you on your toes at all times throughout the movie.
"Jul 3, 2020",9,"I remember movies BP(Before Pulp), they were boring, dull, and lame retreads of one another. Then a movie about two hit men, a boxer, a mob boss and his wife, a gold watch and a suitcase came along and restored my faith in film. There are only two flaws in Pulp. The scenes w/Butch and Fabion drag a little and the movie ends. One complaint that I often hear is that people don't understand what the movie was about. The movie is about Redemption plain and simple. Some people don't see it but it is there. I still remember the first time I saw it and I kept trying to figure out where the movie was going. I was wrong everytime I guessed. Another great thing about it is that each story can work independently of each other. I've watched the three stories separately and still enjoy each one of them. My favourite story is ""The Bonnie Situation"". Much needed comic relief after ""The Gold Watch"". Great stories, great script, great cast, great music and simply the best movie ever made."
"Apr 17, 2020",4,"There is just so much to say about this movie that I don't know where to start! I had no idea what I was ""in for"" when I went to see this movie.  I really hadn't seen the previews for it, and had read nothing about it at all. Usually, this is the best way for me to go into a movie...otherwise I have too many expectations.  Well, even if I *had* known something about Pulp, I don't think I would have expected what I got.  Not that I'm complaining.Pulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride wherever Tarantino feels like taking you.  And what a thrilling ride it is!  From the opening scene we're left scratching our heads wondering exactly where Quentin is going to lead us on this one.  Is it another Natural Born Killers?  Another Reservoir Dogs?  Although there are nods to his other films, as well as several others, Pulp Fiction stands on its own.  From shocking to downright hysterical...this movie has it all.  Samuel Jackson is incredible (although I'm quite partial to him anyway) as the Bible quoting Jules.  John Travolta is tremendous as Vincent and is purely delightful to watch as the story unfolds.  The cast could not have been more perfect and Tarantino brings the best out in each and every one of the actors and actresses.Is there excessive use of the ""f word""?  Well, sure.  But c'mon!  We're talking about ""gangsters"" here (not to mention the 20th century)...for reality sake the ""f word"" really has become a part of everyday language for many people.  Aside from that, it *is* a Tarantino film and, well, he's not exactly known for being a prude.Glorifying violence and drug use...   Oh boy, don't even get me started. The LAST impression I got from this movie was some sort of message stating: ""it's ok to do drugs and kill people"".  Ummm, no.  Ok ok, so there may be teenagers who see this, you say.  Well then here we go on the ""it's the movies fault that there are problems..."" tangent.  I'm not even going into that one.  Bottom line regarding the drug use and violence:  if you are *that* impressionable, you probably shouldn't be watching anything beyond a G-rated Disney movie...and even that is questionable.All in all, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic film.  With its fabulous acting, perfectly cast crew, and hilarious moments, Pulp is one thrill after another.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to see it for what it is and can focus on the movie...not the bits and pieces taken waaaay out of context.  10 out of 10 stars."
"Apr 16, 2020",4,"This film may play with its use of chronology, and it may be episodic, but people generally claim this movie to be great because it is the first to do so. It is certainly not the first film to do either of these things. It is inspired by many films before it, such as Rashomon - which tells the same story from four different perspectives - as well as ""My Life to Live,"" a neorealist film which is told in twelve distinct episodes. However, Pulp Fiction was the first film to play with chronology in this manner in many years, and it is because it does so with great purpose which helps to make it my favorite movie (among various other reasons).Some complain about this fiddling with chronology to cause confusion, yet the story only goes out of the linear time line in two spots in the film, and I always found it easy to follow. As for the BIG episodes in the film (the ones Tarantino actually gave titles to) the first two are played in chronological order, and the third episode shown jumps back to a spot before the other two stories. I will not got too in depth with my next comment as it would give too much away if I did, but Tarantino's choice to show Butch Coolidge's story (Bruce Willis) before Jules' story (Samuel L Jackson) has a huge impact on the way the audience views Vincent Vega (John Travolta) by the end of the film. It is this fact combined with the way Jules' story ends that left me mind-blown when I watched this film for the first time.I understand that in the context of 1994 when this film was released that it was an extremely violent film. If you're still going to complain about the violence in this film today, I would laugh and tell you there is no way you could handle more contemporary films like Mongol, 300, or Gone Girl. Hell, I hope you can make it through Django Unchained, Tarantino's most recent and by far his most violent film to date. What people forget to say about the violence in Pulp Fiction is that most of it actually happens off screen, leaving the violence up to the audience's imagination (maybe this is why people remember it to be more violent than it actually is).What I realized and loved about this film after watching it for a few times is that the three stories of this film all have a common connection - they deal with loyalty to a father figure, each one more intimate than the last. We have Vincent Vega struggling to be loyal to Marsellus Wallace (the crime boss), we have Butch Coolidge honoring his father, and we have Jules Winnfield rethinking his relationship with God.Other than the chronology of the film, what is easily the most notable thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. Tarantino has arguably written better scenes after this film (in fact, I agree with his choice of the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds as his favorite thing he has written), but this is the movie by Tarantino that EVERYBODY quotes, especially the famous scene when Jules dominates the conversation about breakfast and what Marsellus Wallace looks like (trust me, even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably heard a friend quoting this scene). Tarantino is a master of dialogue - he writes conversations that people might actually have with each other. The topics may seem random, but that's how real-world conversations work. You discuss events, make analogies, disagree and argue - you don't simply talk about what is going to happen or what has happened, which is unfortunately how a lot of dialogue in film goes. Tarantino always creates distinct and well-developed characters through his use of dialogue.This movie is a roller coaster of an experience, and it gets my highest rating.4.0/4.0"
"Apr 16, 2020",4,"There is a world of many, many motion pictures, from Roundhay Garden Scene in 1888, to the films of Charlie Chaplin, Ingmar Bergman, to the Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind, and Casablanca. There is Titanic and Terminator, there is Night of the Living Dead and Gigli. There is The Godfather and Space Jam. In a world of several hundreds of thousands of movies, the most familiar and yet still original is Pulp Fiction.Perhaps life long cinephilia breeds a great filmmaker? Perhaps ""veteran"" actors are better than more contemporary actors? Perhaps dialog can be one of the most memorable parts of a film? While only a handful of films top Pulp Fiction in terms of quality, and craft, at 154 minutes, it remains cool, cocky, and deeper than what is led on during the first viewing.Not telling you about the plot is probably best for those unfamiliar with it. To call it a film with out a message is incredibly arrogant. Reading between fairly thick lines is a story about human redemption and choices. No mainstream movie maker has attempted what Tarantino does here.The characters are interesting, along with the acting in terms of greatness, and deep, along with the dialog, cinematography, storyline, and direction. Compared to Tarantino's Jackie Brown, it is very in your face, in a good way. You'll actually get to appreciate movies more after you see Pulp Fiction.The violence presented in minimalist, and very tastefully done. But best of all, it is, well, cool. It leaves me feeling shaken, like a powerful wave comes over me.Don't go in with any expectations however, experience it pure. Then you realize how fantastic it truly is. My hat's off to you, Quentin Tarantino, and if you haven't seen this movie already, see it. Twice."
"Apr 15, 2020",4,"Pulp Fiction in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all-time.  I really don't understand why many people claim it to be one of the greatest movies ever.  It's cruel, stupid, idiotic.  It's full of violence & f-words to the point that it's sickening.  It's like, let's get a couple of guns, a couple of f-words, a couple of murders and let's combine them to make a movie.  I hated everything about it.  EVERYTHING.  To me, all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames.  So the scenes were not in chronological order, big deal.  That doesn't make it a masterpiece.  This is hollywood garbage. There are some scenes that are sick.  The movie is SICK.  This is my review. I gave it a 2/10 just because the actors are respected.  Everything else is idiotic."
"Apr 3, 2020",5,"What a great movie. Deserves all of the praise it gets. I might be saying this because I am a dude but this is one of the best movies of all time. Wonderfully paced, classic scenes, classic lines, and great performances from Jackson, Travolta, Thurman, Keitel, Rhames, Willis and not such a great performance from Tarantino. My favorite chapter has to be the Bonnie Situation purely because of Harvey Keitel as the Wolf."
"Feb 22, 2020",8,"This movie is seriously over rated. There was nothing so special about the movie plot. The story was okay type also this movie was a bit lengthy than it should be so it made the plot more boring. I don't know why people are finding this movie so good, I watched this because it was high rated and I had some mind-blowing expections but the movie is 'in my opinion' not 8.9 imdb type"
"Feb 20, 2020",8,"I must have seen this movie about 7 times! I remeber the first time I was a little lost, but that is because I was not paying attention to it, and everyone who has seen it, told me, you have to pay attention to every single scene and detail. I watched it the second time and I LOVED it. I totally got it and loved it so much, I had to watch it again. You really do have a lot going on in this movie and it is worth watching still!!"
"Aug 20, 2019",6,"I just felt like adding a comment although I've seen the movie like for 10 times and it was made over 5 years ago. Anyway, there's not much point in going into WHY Pulp Fiction is so great - everyone who's seen it, understands it. So I just wanted to say that it's one of the two movies that has got the ""Loved it"" rating from me at Moviecritic.com, alongside with Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant"". A movie the world (or at least mine) could not do without."
"Jul 29, 2019",9,"Why did people like this?Tiresome streams of pop-culture references?(""like kane in Kung Fu"" ""Elvis or Beatles? Brady Bunch or Hogan's Heroes?

I didn't expect you to have such good coffee.  this is one mean cup of joe!"")Hip depictions of Drug Culture.?It's annoying bellyflop into the middle of the retro craze fashion herd?one dimensional characters pointing guns at each other's heads? (the cheapest, most half-assed, most cliched way to generate drama = person pointing gun at another person's head.  And yelling. over and over.)""cool"" sunglasses?Take these things out, and the movie still isn't very good. Leave them in and it's trendy and annoying.If you are a teenager and don't know anything about HK films, films from the 70s, or the 70s in general, are easily duped by hype, I urge you to see this movie. It was made for you!! It will TOTALLY BLOW YOU AWAY, MAN! Dude!"
"Apr 29, 2019",5,"Pulp fiction is... well it's pulp fiction. It gets everything right. I initially didn't think much of this film on a first viewing but it's slowly become one of my all time favourites (yes I know that's cliché)
This was Tarantino's break out flick, and as much as I love reservoir dogs I'm happy that it is. I'm let's face it, this is still his best movie. I can gush about the performances, specifically Jackson because my god is he great in this. I just wanted to mention Travolta, who disappeared after the Grease and then was crapped on after 'B:E' and 'Gotti'. He's not exactly my cup of tea but even I can admit he is great in this
You've already seen it, you've got the poster on your wall. This review will just be added to the masses but hey everyone 10/10 counts, right?"
"Jul 29, 2018",9,"I've watched all films that Tarantino directed but for me this Pulp Fiction is the best of all of them.It's a little bit difficult to explain this movie. This looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue , three stories and epilogue.They seem to be disconnected but after watching, everything is connected.Prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from Mafia Vincent and Jules . They takes a order from their boss Marsellus to collect  his possessions.   First story is about Vincent and Marsellus's wife Vega. He is asked to take care of her by Marsellus.  Second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose.  Third is about Vincent and Jules again. They happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve.  Epilogue is also them at a restaurant.If there's a word describes this movie, it must be ""crazy"" in a good sense. All of the stories are completely crazy, full of sex talks and violence, and there's no message from this. However, I do love this craziness.  I have to admit that Tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters. Particularly, I like Jules acted by Samuel Jackson. I'm fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites Ezekiel 25:17. It's imprinted on my mind. Also I think conversations of this movie are really amusing. They're meaningless and not important but  For instance, one about hamburger is awesome. Every time after watching, I come to want to eat a hamburger!The story I like most is second. The scene Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing!This is a cheap B movie. But it's waste to miss this sophisticated story , direction like music and enjoyable acting.After watching, you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again."
"Jul 29, 2018",9,"Firstly I should say that I saw the sanitised for tv version - I don't watch 'R' rated movies and this was 'R' rated even here in Australia. This obviously means that the film was not entirely as the director intended it to be. I must say 'though that, while this film has many interesting features, some classy acting and the occasional witty repartee', it is in my opinion on the whole nothing more than a crude and juvenile attempt to shock and offend the majority of the movie watching population. Being visually and verbally assaulted by film may well make for a memorable cinematic experience but doesn't necessarily make for a good film. But it isn't so much the action itself as much as the language which achieves this - and most of the profanities (and I include the all too frequent use of n****r in this list) were unnecessary - I tend to side with Spike Lee on this issue, QT is never gonna be a black man no matter how hard he might try. And while this movie is offensive and far from original, it has some very clever aspects and shows some of the directorial class QT clearly has (although no real acting ability - his cameo was a big mistake). In all I ended up with rather mixed feelings about this movie. My vote 7/10"
"Apr 29, 2018",5,"Pulp fiction is a type of movie which makes a strong argument for the case that cinema is both art and entertainment. Pulp fiction is a highly entertaining movie filled with extra ordinary performances, talented actors and a very intelligent script. That's not to say that it is not an artistic cinema, today, the movie stands as one of the greatest movie ever made. With non linear narrative, powerful performances, excellent score and memorable dialogues which will stay with u forever, pulp fiction qualifies the rigorous beauty that is cinema.."
"May 12, 2016",1,"I loved this madcap yarn about 2 hitmen for the mob, a mobster's nutty girlfriend, a punch drunk boxer, and 2 ineffective bandits. The story was told in flashback form, a technique that I have always found interesting. The lives of all the players criss-cross with each other forming a collection a mini-stories guaranteed to captivate the viewer. Unusually done film, very entertaining."
"May 11, 2016",1,"Going into this for the first time, I knew this would be a good movie and I would enjoy it. However, I had no idea that it would be this good. It practically blew me away.This movie follows how 6 people's lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence, drug-use, and murder.What this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive. When I first saw the beginning, I didn't think much of it and as the film progressed, I forgot about it. But when it comes back at the ending, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot. I was in awe when the credits first started to roll.Also, this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic. It is also very well-done too. I honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie. Like Jaws, when I think of this movie, the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head. It may not be as iconic as Jaws's music but it definitely is of equal quality.Also, the acting couldn't be much better. In my opinion, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis all gave perfect performances. They are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they couldn't do any better.This movie also has very great repeat watchability to it. The first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable. But just like Fight Club, this movie gets better and better every time you watch it. Mainly because the fact that you know what's going to happen and that you know all of its surprises, makes several scenes even more engaging. Also, this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes. It's super rare for a film to have 2 iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture.So in conclusion, this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons. It has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over 20 years. I think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also. I think that this is Tarantino's best film and I also think that it is one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies."
"May 10, 2016",1,"This is a tour de force of brilliantly precise screen writing, perfect acting, precise camera-work, perfect directing and world class dialogue writing. 'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.Some people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. But as far as I'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how Tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. In a nutshell........ yeah, 'Pulp Fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er."
"May 9, 2016",1,"The representative works of non-linear narrative films. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, and the dialogue is wonderful. Everyone in the film has a good quality, but they are hopelessly towards the dark and confused. Each paragraph is not divided into the beginning and the end, complementary structure, the beginning and the end of the connection, suggesting that the reality of similar movies in the plot is always happening, never stop. Line: why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find someone really special can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence."
"Dec 23, 2015",7,"I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend because she had seen it with some friends and said it was so good. I made it through the whole thing SOMEHOW, and as we were walking through the parking lot I just started thinking that this movie has sucked over 2 hours of life from me and I'll never get it back. I honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing. There is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast (NOT Travolta nor Thurman) and their ability was limited due to the awful script. There is nothing groundbreaking about this movie, the dialog is boring, the characters have no depth. It seems like it was made on a 24 hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an ""F"" word anywhere there was a space. I wouldn't have cared less if Tarantino had had another character that built an atomic bomb that accidentally detonated and wiped out everyone in this collection of trash. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen, especially for something so highly praised."
"Dec 20, 2015",7,While most films will be highlighted and soon after disappear throughout time Pulp Fiction will stand out as a unique raw film in it's story dynamic and diverse character base.
"Dec 2, 2015",7,"In my opinion, the greatest movie of all time. It makes people laugh and keeps them engaged at the same time. Hope Quentin Tarantino makes his last movie better than this and win Best Picture and/or Best Director. Seriously, the jokes in this movies make you laugh till you cry."
"Oct 17, 2015",10,"I saw this on DVD recently, and was really pleased with it. From the opening scene with ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" until the last scene, I was glued to the screen. Seeing all the big names interact was a lot of fun. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and more. All the characters had an important part in the story. No minor roles, and all of them should have been given an award! The scene with the ""gimp"" was a bit disturbing, but it didn't hurt the viewing. Tarentino's films are always gripping your attention and holding it until the last credit goes by. I highly recommend this movie. Be sure to get the DVD with the extras, and you will enjoy your night in front of the television. Start dancing the ""bat-tusi"" and have fun!"
"Jul 3, 2015",9,"I just bought the ""Pulp Fiction"" Collector's Edition DVD boxed set, and I was glad I did.  Not only does it include this great movie, but it also contains an interview with Quentin Tarantino on the ""Charlie Rose"" show, an interview with him and Michael Moore at the Independent Spirit Awards and even a Trivia Track.  It would've been way cool if it included director's or actors' commentary, but I still felt it was worth my money--especially since I got it for a good price at $19.99.Anyways, back to the movie.  This is an inspired, truly original work of art that doesn't appear like the traditional work of art.  This can be considered an art film, but it's not an art film that bores you with pretention after pretention and has almost no momentum to keep it going. This film has plenty of momentum.  Even at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I had trouble hitting the ""Pause"" button.First of all, the cast is topnotch.  As many know, this is the film that re-launched John Travolta's career.  And that's great, being that he's one hell of an actor, and this is one of his best performances--the ultra-cool Vincent Vega.  Ironically enough, he was only paid about 10,000 dollars (give or take) for this movie, being that it was shot on a modest budget--though it rarely shows.  And now he's a multi-millionaire.  I think Travolta owes more than a ""thank you"" to Mr. Tarantino.  Samuel L. Jackson is also terrific as the ultra-hip Jules Winnfield.  He has some of the best lines, which I will get to later.  Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances, showing that as well as a great movie star he's also a terrific actor.  Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are great in the opening and closing scenes, though I wish their accents could've been a tad less thick. Harvey Keitel makes a moderately short but memorable appearance.  Ving Rhames is thoroughly convincing as the terrifyingly evil Marscellus Wallace. Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette have some funny moments as Travolta's drug-dealing buddies.  And Uma Thurman--though not a very beautiful actress--is perfect as the free-spirited, coke-snorting Mia Wallace.
My favorite element of this movie?  (And I'm sure I'm not alone on this one) The dialogue, of course!  ""Pulp Fiction"" has some of the most memorable dialogue in movie history.  Tarantino has an incredible knack for writing dialogue, as shown before in movies like ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""True Romance"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn.""  After watching this movie twice (since purachasing the DVD), there are some lines I simply cannot shake out my head.  These are some of my favorite quotes:""My name is Pitt, and yo a*s ain't talkin' your way out of this s**t.""""Does he look like a b**ch?  I said, 'Does he look like a b**ch!'""(After the cab driver asks Butch--Bruce Willis--what his name means) ""This is America.  Our names don't mean s**t.""""Pulp Fiction"" is the perfect balance of dark comedy, crime drama, romance and action.  It's a wild, perfectly enjoyable ride that you will never forget.  OK, so this movie does go into the love-it-or-hate-it category. I personally love the movie, but there is the minority that don't think too much of ""PF.""  Whenever you have a movie that's 2 hours and 30 minutes long, packed with dialogue, packed with profanity and doesn't bombard its audience with gratuitous visuals, you can't expect everybody to embrace it with open arms.  In a short while, I've fell in love with Tarantino's unique, realistic and profane writing/directorial style.  Others can't quite handle it.  I still don't understand the whole violence issue.  In the average movie, you see about 20 guys getting blown away with machine guns all within a 3-minute scene.  Most of the violence here is left to the imagination. Well, I guess people have a strong imagination.My only criticisms are a few slow moments and one cheesy attempt at rear-screen projection (during the Bruce Willis cab scene) in which the cab is obviously not moving and you see black-and-white footage (probably from an old movie) in the background.  But I still consider this a great movie, and one I'm proud to include in my DVD collection.  I can't wait 'til the Special Edition of ""Reservoir Dogs"" comes out this week, so can buy it and the ""Jackie Brown"" DVD to complete my Tarantino collection.  And is the soundtrack great or what!  I actually bought the soundtrack before I bought the movie, and I fell in love with the music just as much.  It includes such greats as Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" and ""Jungle Boogie.""  And who can forget that great ""Pulp Fiction"" theme?  It was interesting to find out that the song wasn't composed specifically for this movie, and that it did actually exist beforehand.My score:  9 (out of 10)"
"Mar 10, 2015",1,"Saw this at the cinema as a rerelease despite having seen it many times it's still worth a watch on the big screen.One thing I love about this film is you always notice something new, tonight I learned Steve Buscemi is it!Still brilliant and still worth a few hours of anyone's time"
"Oct 18, 2014",10,"Pulp Fiction, in my opinion, is the Citizen Kane of our generation. It contains so much: gritty crime drama, at times hysterical humor, edge of your seat suspense, incredible acting, and hard to forget scenarios. I think this movie got completely robbed in the Oscar race losing pretty much everything to the highly overrated Forrest Gump. Gump was okay, a great history lesson and decent effects...the story was way lacking. Pulp Fiction deserved all that year. Pulp Fiction is unique in its manner of story telling. It's not your typical Scene A to B format. It goes all over the place and doesn't go in order. It also lets you see things from other peoples perspectives while also knowing what other characters are doing in the background. Like in the beginning sequence as Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are talking you can hear a conversation between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. Travolta even walks past them. Tarantino really had a great idea for this movie and it turned out fantastic. If you haven't seen it go get Pulp Fiction...you will not be disappointed."
"Aug 21, 2014",6,"This is my first review, so don't judge too hard(Pretty much wrote it, only to complete my profile). I was 16 when this movie came out, and I remember how good every said it was. To be honest, after I saw it, I didn't understand what all the hype was about. Later I decided to give it another chance. This time It was a totally different experience, it was like it all came together. I have loved the movie ever since, and I must have seen over 10 times now. The acting is sublime. The story is awesome. The dialog is captivating. This movie sat Quentin Tarantino's name stone as one of, if not the best director of all times. Not only this one but pretty much all of his movies is a treat for the eyes and ears. It's A must see movie!"
"May 19, 2014",1,"The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy.
Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities.
""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""Pulp Fiction"" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it.
Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. No one is immune. No matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair Is a ""vulgar novel"", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies."
"May 11, 2014",1,"Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.This is the most overrated film of all time. I'm even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were ""OK"" movies but didn't deserve the huge credit they received.I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I'm not going to tell those of you that haven't seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Don't listen to anyone's opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then you're COOL!"
"May 11, 2014",1,"Well my first review just accidentally got deleted so here is for a second go of it.. Pulp Fiction has an excellent ability to interweave multiple dissimilar narratives into one cohesive story. It has a knack for balancing tense, dramatic moments with witty, comedic relief. Scenes such as the pawn shop basement with Zed, the hit men's clothing change after hiding a body with the Wolf, and Captain Koons' monologue showcase Tarantino's warped sense of humor."
"May 7, 2014",1,"From my opinion.. I watch the movie till the end and there's no nothing something special ""story"" ..alright it classic old movie was made 90s about crime ... but I don't find drama in the the movie ... however it wasn't too good and and it wasn't so bad."
"Mar 17, 2014",1,"Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable."
"Oct 19, 2013",10,"As a lover of oddities and strange things, this movie hit home. It's a cult classic, and wil forever keep that status, because it's unqiue and never gets old. The screenwriting is superb, and somewhat nonsensical, but that's what makes it great. There is no real moral, nothing besides 'enjoy the sho and enjoy it at surface value'.Films like this are memorable and rewatchable, and I would recommend it to individuals who have enjoyed nonsensical movies in the past.I am still wondering what is in the suitcase, and can understand Abed's obsession with it, and his obsession with this movie. Truly a masterpiece by Tarantino, making a non-linear film that could aily confuse the watcher, into serving that exact purpose yet still keeping it entertaining and out there."
"Oct 18, 2013",10,"This Movie is one of last century's biggest achievements. No exaggerating. To make a winning masterpiece, you have to be special. Is master Tarantino special? Tell me about it. People find themselves in Pulp Fiction and remain in awe of its stunning style, a work of art that wins in all areas. This is not my favorite movie ever, but I admit it's the most powerfully and creatively made among what I've seen.Not everybody will completely understand Pulp Fiction, Not that I claim I'm superior to many, no, the point is you have to know Tarantino to 1.enjoy and 2.figure out this movie quite well.The long and rich dialogue sequences, the unique close-ups, the usual tribute to the history of Cinema, the captivating violence and finally, the innovative style of the picture should be visible only to those who know the young phenomenon to an enough extent.The first time I saw it I was like, ""This must be great but I've not gotten the message"". The second time that happens to have happened a few minutes ago made me understand that THERE IS NO MESSAGE, a fact that per se was enough to convince me this one is a top-10 on my list.Tarantino is many young director-to-be's idol. He's got a gift, his works contain what many liked and seriously tried to insert in their films but couldn't. If Scorsese has one live rival to be able to compete with him, then it's none other than our man.Travolta and L.Jackson are in my opinion the best pair ever in the history of Cinema here and the supporting roles are acted to perfection. You can't imagine this movie without the presence of Thurman, Keitel or even cameos by the likes of Arquette and Z.Tarantino is a film lover/freak and you can sense it in each and every moment of his works, so make sure this title is the first one you'll watch after reading my review because I'm telling you, you'll love it."
"Aug 22, 2013",6,"I love this film so much, i only really saw this film last year when i was 15, i was looking through my dads DVD collection and saw pulp fiction (the limited version) a few weeks before that i heard my ex boyfriend talking about it so i decided to watch it. I was in for a real shock seeing John travolta in it. I just used to think he was a bit of an all singing all dancing loser after watching 'Grease' when i was a little girl! But he kicked some ass in this film and as for samuel L jackson what a legend, this is now my all time favourite movie , i can watch it over and over and not get bored!.the only bit I'm not to keen on has to be the gimp scene! *cringes* i have to close my eyes at that part. any way great film"
"Aug 21, 2013",6,"Seriously, what is with all of the one star ratings on this film? What a disgrace. What the people HATED about this movie is exactly what makes it good. So many people complain there is no storyline. Bullshit. If you were actually paying attention to the film you would find that this picture was divided into different segments and switched around. Just because it's something different than what you're used to doesn't mean it's bad. It's called a ""non parallel plot."" Famous authors and filmmakers do this all the time, you just may have not noticed. Quentin Tarantino just takes it to another level because he has a very unique style where he likes to give you major cliffhangers and start the next substory, making you crave for more (an you do get it, just later on.) If anything, its a series of several stories, and the film is edited the way it is to show how these different stories intertwine. It's not that complicated of a concept, but the low intelligence of many viewers may result in complete confusion of what's going on.Flat characters? I really don't even need to get into this one. The characters all had their own distinct personalities AND YES, character development. If Jules' transition from crime in the beginning to wanting to get out of the business in the end isn't character development, then I don't know what is. There is an obvious misconception here of what character development actually is. And too much dialogue? That's Tarantino's style. What's with this sudden rule that a film should always be visually told and not told verbally? Bullshit. Art is something like a free for all. It works here. The dialogue is natural and is witty. I heard one reviewer say Tarantino is self indulgent here because his dialogue represents his thoughts too much. WTF? Just because he has a wordy script style means he's too self indulgent? He's simply writing a script with witty dialogue, there is no ego trip here. This claim is simply and utterly ridiculous. And if you're complaining about him being in his own movies, go ahead and say that Alfred Hitchcock was self indulgent and a bad filmmaker. I am very sure many people here wouldn't dare claim that.Overall, this is indeed one of the greatest films ever made. And that isn't because it's a fad film like many others say. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a film that has completely revolutionized the way film handles dialogue and the editing of a film's story. If people are unable to acknowledge that then they are only limiting their perception of what has made films evolve to what it is today. Films like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey,"" ""Psycho,"" ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"" etc., are all films with this kind of status. If you don't enjoy this film, then that is fine. However, to deny the importance or influence this film has graced upon the medium is simply foolish and unenlightened on the part of the viewer.This is simply one of the most entertaining films you will ever see in your life if you can keep up with the pace and the story. It may take a few viewings if you're the kind of person that can't understand this kind of plot, but I guarantee almost every time that if you watch this film over and over and study it like I have and numerous other classics, you will notice all of the big and little things that make this film what it is. It's truly a remarkable film. There may be little symbolism beside's Jules' commentary on the bible and reciting of biblical passages, but this film is more so about the entertainment than symbolic storytelling. There are two different kinds of films in that way, the ones that try to allude to something symbolic or important like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and there are other films that rely on entertaining the viewer like this film and ""Jaws."" I'm sure not many people will call ""Jaws"" a bad film either. Anyway, don't listen to the one star reviewers. They simply didn't understand the film, its story, or its style. This film is a real treat."
"Aug 20, 2013",6,"Tarantino's outstanding original screenplay contains everything that all create this pure masterpiece. The characters, culture, acting, cast ... with elements of comedy that make it more enjoyable than you could imagine. Pulp Fiction is perfection at its finest. One of the greatest films of all time without question."
"Jul 28, 2012",9,"Many Tarantino fans differ on what Tarantino's best film was. Reservoir Dogs? Pulp Fiction? Inglorious Basterds? Having seen all three, the opinion I submit is the majority opinion—Pulp Fiction. But why? Pulp Fiction, in my view, represents something few movies can pull off. A completely pointless narrative made into an astonishingly good film. What is so good about a movie with no point? It's actually rather simple. Pulp Fiction doesn't use extensive special effects, or mind-bending plot, or bizarre character development. Tarantino, in fact, wrote this one pretty much by-the-book, along with co-writer Roger Avary. The plot is nothing unusual or never-before-seen. But it's the careful eye of the artist, in front of and behind the camera, that makes this film such a treat.I have watched it six times already, and each time, the movie just gets better. Each time, I see something in the background that I didn't see before. I catch something someone says, or see some minor backdrop detail that I didn't pick up on. However, this isn't why I love Pulp Fiction so much. These details are not the main thing.It's the complete package. When you step back and look at Pulp Fiction as a whole, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Tarantino specifically chose 50 ASA film stock to make it look older than it was. This film created a beautiful look for a movie set in the sunny Hollywood Heights. The music was perfect for the crime thriller part of the feel of this movie, and the use of the Hawthorne Grill and the Chevy Nova were perfect selections to add to the classic feel of this movie, even though it's quite apparent that it's set in the modern day. Butch is driven to the hotel in a Checker cab, everything in general feels older than it really is.But what really sells it is the actors. Today, this wouldn't be a star-studded cast, it would be a diamond-studded, cast-on-platinum cast. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson make perfect hit men, and are crucial at the beginning of the film to setting up a surprising scene. Uma Thurman's small role is nevertheless appreciated, and she makes the most of her screen time not only on the part of the writers, but also because she has excellent delivery on her lines. At the end, though, I feel that Jackson is the star, even though there is truly no primary role here. His monologues are to die for in this movie.All in all, if you have not seen Pulp Fiction, change that."
"Jul 3, 2011",9,"The soundtrack of ""Pulp Fiction"" is a crucial element of its identity, featuring an eclectic mix of surf rock, soul, and pop. Tarantino's selection of music not only complements the film's tone but also enhances its narrative. Tracks such as Dick Dale's ""Misirlou"" and Dusty Springfield's ""Son of a Preacher Man"" are not just background music but integral parts of the film's atmosphere and storytelling. The songs used in the film give it a timeless quality, a sense that events on screen are happening in an alternate reality. The action seemed to be set in the present day, but the characters remain blissfully unaware of the period's dominant forms of music: grunge, hip-hop and electronica."
"Aug 20, 2010",6,"What ""Pulp Fiction"" does is not give you the normal, rinky-dink, Point-A to Point-B, generic movie. The film isn't about plot progression. What Tarantino does, in essence, is create an entire world. This is a vast, interwoven, interacting, multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid, solid characters. What this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character, but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world, into another life, and accept this ""morally ambiguous"" modern-day epic. Truly, there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer. And, lastly, on a personal level, while I do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history, it is personally my favorite film, and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry. So obviously, it must have something going for it."
"Apr 29, 2010",5,"As usual Tarantino shows us again and again, what a good writing could achieve in a movie. With countless of seamless dialogues that flows like a river. And story arcs that intertwined with each other, the audience will be swept away in a heartbeat by just listening to those writings. Even a blind man can watch Pulp Fiction."
"Dec 23, 2008",7,"Have you ever gone from one extreme to the other on an issue? Our President excluded, many of us change our minds about things on a daily basis. When it comes to philosophies or preferences, we're not static creatures because we realize obstinance is not a virtue. We change, we evolve - that is to be human.Well, my opinion of Pulp Fiction has underwent several cataclysmic upheavals since I first saw the film in its year of release, 1994. I was 14 and, without exaggerating, Pulp Fiction shattered my concept of film. I'd never been so excited, intrigued and in love with a film. It forced me to reconsider what quality cinema was - it was no longer just the greats, the Best Picture winners, etc. Great cinema could be anything - old gangster movies, film noir, B-horror flicks, 1950s melodrama. The film also prompted me to explore film on a more academic basis, as I began reading film theory and film criticism regularly.I worshiped at the shrine of Tarantino and watched everything he put his hands on - be that Destiny Turns on the Radio or 4 Rooms.His other work (even Reservoir Dogs, which, I am convinced, is nothing more than a decent first film) disappointed me, but I never once second-guessed Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown in 1997 re-affirmed my faith in the man, but then he disappeared and a funny thing happened, I second guessed Pulp Fiction.The dialogue, which I once thought brilliant, was not stilted and forced - a little too hip for its own good. The acting was all right, but seemed weaker than I remembered, and the once brilliant story became trite. The masterpiece became, in my eyes, pretentious, though still watchable fare. On my list of 100 favorite films, it fell from the top-10 to the upper 70s.Years went by, I continually found myself drawn to Jackie Brown (I think it's Tarantino's most mature wok and a wrongfully maligned masterpiece), but I avoided Pulp Fiction. A friend who had never seen the film asked one day if we could throw my copy on and it was like watching it for the first time.Everything that seemed forced or trite was brilliant. The dialogue that seemed overly stylized now seemed perfectly stylized and, really, perfectly at odds with the plot, which, though it contains recycled elements, became an energetic, hyper-kinetic, and amazing narrative again.Pulp Fiction quickly returned to the top of my favorites list. Why the swift rising and falling? I have no idea. It could be that QT created a film that is so tied to its audience's state of mind that their reaction to it is a complete crap shoot for him. That's doubtful. What I think truly happened is this: my adolescent mind reacted to its pop-culture references and its manic pace. It was hip and cool, really, and therefore perfect for your alterna teenagers. I matured, grew disdainful of things hip and cool (it was obviously cooler to dislike things that were cool right?), and so began disliking PF. I grew up a little more, became a little more perceptive, and therefore able to appreciate exactly what QT does with narrative and dialogue. Pulp Fiction, though this may seem odd, is a very subtle movie. Its brilliance at first seems superficial, but dig a little deeper and you'll find a film that is narratively amazing and that carries emotional weight. It's not all style; it's not just hip. It's an intelligent and wonderful movie and I don't think that I'll change my mind on it again."
"Feb 22, 2008",8,"The movie is really wonderful. A must watch for anyone who likes movies, or the art of movie making or the art of story telling. The most impressive are the cast and the story which has unforgettable opening and closing scenes.Adding to this is the fabulous guitar when the starting titles come on. Loved the movie from beginning to end. The Uma Thurman and Travolta dance is not to be missed. This is a wonderful and hilarious way of depicting the LA crime scene and Hit men activities. Very raw and straightforward way of story telling with in your face explicit language which adds to the real feel of the movie."
"Oct 21, 2005",10,"Well what can I say?This film is by far the best Tarantino film! First of all because it is one on its on I mean can you honestly put this film into a genre? It has elements of comedy, horror, action, thriller I could go on for ever! I was never into films until about three years ago and had to study an auteur so I picked Tarantino and I am sooo glad after I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time I thought whats all the fuss about but after watching it a second time I realised what all the critics were on about its fantastic one of the best film to come out of America in a long while and I suspect it will be a couple more years before a legend such as Quentin will appear on our screens once again!"
"Aug 22, 2005",6,"Not only a brilliant script, with incredible characters brought together over one CRAZY Boxing match that takes us through the World that only Quentin could guide us through.Nothing says Koontz Better than Walken, nohing says Muthafucha better than Ving and Nothing....No one, can ever TOP the POWER of Jackson's over Kill Bad ass Jules!"
"Apr 29, 2005",5,"I still remember watching this movie when it first came out in theaters. I couldn't believe what I just saw. My friends and I would go back at least a dozen more times es to watch this in the theater. It became my ll time favorite movie to 5is very day. Anytime the movie would come on TV or HBO or any channel over the years I would have to watch it again. I can safely say I be seen this movie well over 250 times and it never gets old. What Tarantino accomplished here is cinematic masterpiece by its very The Godfather, Goid Fellas and there's Pulp Fiction. That's it. That's the list. Every other movie, no matter how good, comes after the big 3."
"Feb 20, 2005",8,"No more words to describe this film are necessary. It contains what it takes to be considered a true classic! Its characters are a film by themselves, sometimes the plot is not even necessary because we are stuck to those fascinating creatures doing wacky things."
"Apr 18, 2004",4,"So I've been a fan of Pulp Fiction since I was in High School. I watched the movie last night for the first time in awhile and was struck by never really knowing what was in the brief case, so I watched the scene in great detail. I noticed the apartment number was #416. So thinking this is probable related to a bible verse I looked up one starting with Matthew 4:16. I don't read the bible often if ever but since the Movie has the lighting up brief case locked at 666, and Jules set for a path of salvation on seriously changing his ways from a gangster to walking the earth in the path of the Shepard I thought to look it up. So Matthew 4:16 reads ""the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."" I think this relates to the brief case, the people who had it, to Vincent which stayed in the land of the dark and ended up dead, and to Jules which turned to ""the path of the Shepard"" as he says. A great light was shone to Jules (which was currently living in the land of the dark) after the bullets whizzed by him and a light dawned as it did for all the others in the room which where also all living in the land of the shadow of death. Just a theory but better than anything else I've looked through yet."
"Apr 3, 2004",5,"Pinnacle direction. Pinnacle screenplay. Pinnacle acting. Pinnacle cinema.These days you rarely get to see anything original, movies now-a-days have become so cliche and so predictable at an unprecedented level.Released in the 90s, when the world wasn't this 'woke' and sensitive - The Golden Age of cinema.This movie teaches a valuable life lesson - choices matter, your life isn't pre-decided and it's in your hands. It highlights vengeance, forgiveness and even love in a way which you've never experienced before.People who can't get their head around this masterpiece are the real culprits of the degrading cinema these days. Hollywood is just matching with their viewers' viewing level. This is what I believe."
"Apr 18, 2003",4,"Pulp Fiction is a real boom in action movies,unique style of Quentin Tarantino made this movie what it really is-a legend!Of course let´s not forget the great business that the actors did.Even now,after  9 years I like to watch it.It´s a first class movie for sure!"
"Apr 3, 2003",5,"One of the most over rated movies ever. This is a good movie don't get me wrong but people chalk it up to be a masterpiece of film and the best thing ever since the wheel, and i don't see eye to eye with those people sure it's cool, sure it's got good dialogue but there's a lot of awkward scenes that go on for to long. And i was not happy with the ending it was bad and not fun but i digress. My one complaint was to be left more impacted then when i came and what i saw was wild and wacky but when i left i feel like i just saw a movie that had all those cool things but not enough things to care about."
"Dec 23, 2002",7,The movie was weird and was like a genre of its own . But it was weirdly fun to watch it and I had a great time and a great laugh from the movie . Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta were at their best ..
"Dec 23, 2002",7,"I must admit that I'm a little disappointed in myself for not having seen Pulp Fiction until very recently. It's something that I've always been meaning to watch, and you can never really go wrong with Quentin Tarantino. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is legendary, and although I am not a huge fan of John Travolta, I really enjoyed his performance as well. I absolutely loved the style of this film. The dialogue is so smooth and natural, and the way the different story lines intertwine just makes this movie that much more interesting and enjoyable. All of these little elements come together to produce a truly great film, one that I could watch over and over. Pulp Fiction is certainly a must see for everyone, whether you're a film buff or not."
"Oct 18, 2002",10,"If you are looking for Characters with flaws (and a lotta them) that make you feel better about yourself then this is the movie for you.Very fine characters with very interesting interactions make for a movie that explores relationships of all kinds (boss vs employee, lovers, friends) make this a relatable violent flick for kids of all ages above the age of 21+ (haha)"
"Apr 3, 2002",5,"I never thought it'd happen. I've seen a lot of movies. I've given a lot of high ratings. I've never before seen fit to give a movie a ten, though. But I could find not a single thing wrong with this movie.I avoided Quentin Tarantino's movies ever since I saw my first one, which was Kill Bill. I thought it was appalling - the storyline has been done before, the violence was over the top, the gore was stupid, the acting was shocking, and we won't even go into my dislike for Uma Thurman here. I was persuaded to watch both this movie and Reservoir Dogs by my best mate, and after much reluctance I finally acquiesced. And thank all the Gods I did.This manages to be one of the most violent, brutal movies ever produced. However, in a complete paradox to the statement I just made, there is next to no violence in the movie - it runs, much like Reservoir Dogs (but not to the same extent) off the witty and intelligent dialogue, and the incredible acting displayed by everyone involved. And yes, this includes Uma Thurman, despite my hatred for her - I regard her as a terrible actress, whatever beauty she may hold (and let's face it, there ain't much) and I refuse to watch most movies she stars in. She played a small role in this movie, and for once she actually played it well. I extend a hearty salutation.I must give a hearty thumbs up to John Travolta at this point. His character, Vincent Vega, is easily the best I have ever seen him play. Whilst he is a criminal, a junkie, a torturer and a murder, he manages to be extremely likable and you can't help sometimes but wish you were him.To those people who dislike intelligent movies - I advise you against watching this movie. The film grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go until the entire 114 minutes have expired, but if you're possessed of a lower IQ then by the end you won't have much of an idea of what's gone on.The film is constructed in Tarantino's trademark nonlinear fashion, meaning that if you want to watch this movie you haver to do so in one sitting to understand it. you can't just watch bits and pieces of it, otherwise it will make no sense to you whatsoever.I have regained a previously nonexistent respect for Mr. Tarantino with this film, and I look forward to perusing his works in more detail later on.""Get the Gimp!"""
"Feb 21, 2002",8,"With such an amazing cast and phenomenal creation staff it's no wonder I was blown away. I had flashbacks left and right while the dazzlingly twisting and interacting subplots kept me by turns confused and entertained. It's humorous without being slapstick, engagingly violent, and endlessly enthralling. Highly recommended!!"
"Jul 28, 2000",9,"I love this movie. However, Quentin Tarantino should stay on the other side of the camera. I love his work but yikes! He comes off whiny and obnoxious, and the nasal quality of his voice is not too pleasant. Otherwise, though, it's a creative and joyous mess. I adore it."
"Apr 29, 2000",5,"Simply put Pulp Fiction is the silliest film I have every seen, it puts 
 Battlefield Earth and The Long Kiss Goodnight (spookily starring the 
 two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare 
 vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. The fact it is so highly 
 revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the 
 very existence of modern society.
 
 There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion, 
 the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's 
 director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start 
 to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an 
 untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The 
 only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a 
 collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely 
 together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude, 
 made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse, 
 accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as 
 cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a 
 highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art' 
 piece is doubly irresponsible.
 
 Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth. 
 There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to 
 perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they 
 perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to 
 what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly 
 likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from 
 perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer 
 and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the 
 film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where 
 an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the 
 'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring 
 Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia 
 herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film 
 throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be 
 developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch) 
 or their actions performed by a completely new character without making 
 a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the 
 subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who 
 is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is 
 the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage' 
 (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill 
 where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit 
 to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of 
 plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could 
 disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was 
 written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job 
 narrative structure enhanced the story.
 
 The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at 
 times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to 
 mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames) 
 uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The 
 only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the 
 ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a 
 flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue 
 which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is 
 unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots 
 talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers, 
 milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some 
 coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but 
 mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with 
 such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking 
 about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring 
 brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no 
 substance and you have one worthless film. ""Ah you don't get it"" they 
 all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the 
 ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance. 
 The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to 
 justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant 
 to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which 
 consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no 
 actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with 
 any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care 
 even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless 
 monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the 
 briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it 
 beautiful"". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character 
 that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it, 
 combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it. 
 Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion 
 because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some 
 have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings 
 that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has 
 somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As 
 a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself 
 but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the 
 exception."
"Feb 24, 2000",8,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database."
"Aug 20, 1998",6,"This movie has is all.. Good actors, good story, and a helluva ""speed"" all through the movie.. You will never be bored when watching this movie.. With so many good actors in one movie, you could think that it would not be a good movie. But In my opinion, This is the Best movie John Travolta & Laurent Fishbourne ever acted in.. They both are in their peak performance.. One very cool thing about this movie, is that you may THINK, that you know whats gonna happened next... But believe me, you don't have a clue... I have seen this movie at least 50 times already.. And I could easily watch it 50 times more, without getting bored.. It deserves a BIG 10/10..If you haven't seen it, go get a copy immediately.."
