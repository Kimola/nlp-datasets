03.08.2025,10.0,"This is the best movie ever, everyone rate it 10, great casting it should be #1, great story, great direction by Robert Zemeckis and incredible entertainment. All time adventure. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the best movie duo ever.Soundtrack is beautiful and iconic. Editing and production wow.From Einstein to The Hill Valley courthouse, from Johnny B. Goode to 88 mph scenes... I can go on and on, so many incredible details and entertaining ""heart-pounding"" scenes in this movie.The Shawshank redemption is nothing compared to this movie. Maybe it's not nothing but definitely is not better than BTTF.This one with BTTF part 2 and part 3 = The Best Trilogy of all Time."
03.05.2025,5.0,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Marty McFly is a very likable, well-acted character. The film starts out pretty well, introducing Marty's family and other characters, although it does take some time before the time travelling (from 1985 to 1955) occurs - The scenes with the Libyan terrorists at the parking lot seem to drag on and on. Also, what are Libyan terrorists doing in Los Angeles in the 1980s? Anyways...I would've liked to know how Doc met Marty. I mean, how would a 'cool' kid like Marty be friends with a 50+ year old geeky old guy? This isn't really a flaw, but just an honest contemplation. Speaking of the two, the ending dragged for too long. I won't spoil it. But the scene with Marty and Doc waiting for the lightning to strike at the clock became nauseating. I'm guessing the creators were just trying to show off the special effects and sound effects, which seemed pretty good for that time. But I didn't like it and that sequence killed the film's pace. Also, the movie ended in a way that leads to the sequel. So for those expecting a standalone film, you will not be satisfied.The music score by Alan Silvestri is classic and memorable. The characters are also very likable, hence why the film has a classic status. But I still feel it was let-down by the drawn out, bloating ending sequence near the clock tower."
23.02.2025,8.0,"Back to the Future is a near-perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy, and adventure that remains just as entertaining today as it was in 1985. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and featuring a fantastic cast, this film captures the essence of fun, excitement, and nostalgia in one unforgettable time-travel story.Michael J. Fox shines as Marty McFly, a relatable and charismatic teenager who finds himself accidentally sent back to 1955 in a DeLorean-turned-time-machine. His chemistry with Christopher Lloyd's eccentric Doc Brown is nothing short of iconic, making for some of the most memorable moments in film history. The story is fast-paced, filled with humor, and has just the right amount of emotional weight, especially when Marty tries to fix his parents' relationship.Alan Silvestri's triumphant score and the '80s rock soundtrack give the movie its energetic feel, while the practical effects and clever script make the time-travel mechanics easy to follow. If there's any flaw, it's that some of the science is more fantasy than logic, but honestly, that's part of the fun.Overall, Back to the Future is an endlessly rewatchable classic that still holds up today. It's got adventure, comedy, and heart-all wrapped up in a thrilling time-travel journey."
18.02.2025,10.0,"Back to the Future is a film that has firmly secured its place in my heart, and it's one I can watch on repeat without ever growing tired of it. From the very first time I saw it as a kid, I was instantly hooked. I know the entire movie by heart-the dialogue, the iconic scenes, and every memorable moment have been etched in my memory.The genius of Robert Zemeckis shines through as we follow the time-traveling adventures of Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox. As a child, I couldn't help but develop the biggest crush on Marty. His charm, wit, and rebellious spirit made him the quintessential hero for young audiences like me. Who could resist that iconic skateboard ride or the perfect blend of bravado and heart?This film is a true classic that masterfully combines science fiction, adventure, and comedy, all wrapped up in an engaging and entertaining story. The concept of time travel, with its potential for mishaps and adventures, captivated my imagination and sparked countless daydreams about what I would change in my own timeline.Back to the Future isn't just a film I watched; it's an experience that has stayed with me throughout my life. Its themes of friendship, perseverance, and the casual certainty that life can lead to unexpected twists are messages that resonate deeply. It's a film I hold dear to my heart, and sitting down to watch it always feels like visiting an old friend."
15.02.2025,10.0,"Back to the Future is the greatest film in every way. The characters are perfect and funny. The story is amazing and some-what grounded. The music is absolutely magnificent. Doc and Marty are the perfect duo (being solar opposites) and references and little Easter eggs you can catch on your future viewings are absolutely mind blowing and comes to show what a great screenplay Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale made. If your looking for a funny, sci-fi, romance, action, 80s classic look no further than Back to the Future. One of if not Steven Spielberg's best film ever made besides Jaws.""Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads."" - Dr. Emmett Brown."
08.02.2025,10.0,"Ultimate American summer blockbuster. Incredibly clever, nostalgia-packed, and never gets old. Just when it would seem that Steven Spielberg has touched all possible forms of fantasy, he comes up with another one that not only plucks, but plays a complete symphony, on the heartstrings. It's all fiendishly complicated but Zemeckis is an inventive filmmaker with a knack for the happy ending. Disney would have been proud of him -- and more than a little envious of an entertainment which takes a risk or two, and has a ball doing it. I loved it was timeless and I could gladly watch it over and over and over again."

07.01.2025,10.0,"This is a fun, irresistible and original film. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sophisticated. The cinematography, scenery and costumes are excellent. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in his role and so is Michael J Fox, he is also brilliant in his role as Marty Mc Fly. This is overally a brilliant film that is good in so many ways. Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect. The story is awesome. It is delivered cleverly and entertainingly. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something to watch."
05.01.2025,10.0,"I've never written a movie review, despite having watched so many that I've lost count. I was born in 1981, so when this movie came out, I was just a child. Over 40 years have passed, and I can confidently say that this is the movie I've watched the most times in my entire life. Every time I'm channel surfing and this movie is on, I simply can't resist watching it again. The remote stops right there. I think that says it all. For me, this is the best movie ever made.It doesn't fit into any specific genre, in my opinion. It's simply Back to the Future. For those who lived through the '80s and '90s, they'll surely understand its charm. For those who didn't, I don't have the insight to make any judgment, but I believe it's timeless."
30.12.2024,4.0,"In the mainstream Hollywood movies of the 1980s, America was a nation in the process of reconciliation. This reconciliation aims to repair the wounds inflicted on America by the movements of the 1960s and the divisions of the 1970s.So Hollywood in the 1980s tells the story of reconciliation between two generations. In the 1982 film ""The Golden Pond,"" not only did Henry Fonda's grandfather and grandson reach mutual understanding, but he also reached mutual forgiveness with his daughter, Jane Fonda, both in the film and in reality. In 1983, the once popular Star Wars series also reached its final chapter, in which the evil father Black Knight was finally influenced by his son Luke, who sacrificed himself to save him."
29.12.2024,10.0,This movie is a great start of a movie franchise and the writing is awesome. The characters are so greatly written in a way that makes total sense and the learning process is great. The time process doesn't really have any plot holes. The dad glow up is insane and the songs that are in it are amazing the post credit scene is a great way to leave a cliffhanger. It amazing that falling out of a tree and getting hit by a car lead his mother falling in love with him and him having to have his dad fight his high school bully for her to fall in love with him was a great come back for his wimpy character.

09.12.2024,10.0,"What else can really be said about Back to the Future? This beloved movie has been praised in so many ways over the years, that i cant even think of a original thing to say about it. It's a classic, a masterpiece of modern american cinema, one of the most rewatchable movies of all time. Michael J Fox is incredible, Christopher Lloyd is incredible, Lea Thompson is incredible, Crispin Glover is incredible, EVERYONE is incredible in this goddamn film! The direction, the script, etc... Everything is so tight and well put togheter, it's amazing! One of those rare ""lightning in the bottle"" moments in cinema history, when everything that was suppose to go right, GOES RIGHT!"
08.12.2024,10.0,"This was the movie that made me love science fiction movies. I was around 7 years old when I first watched it and I really enjoyed it. Years have passed since I first watched it, but I still watch the movie with the same admiration, it was really great. I thought the movie was pretty good for an 80's movie. The movie's story is also a very original and carefully written story. There are also many references to this movie (The first movie of the movie serie) in the other movies of the movie serie.It was truly one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, and also the best time travel movie I've ever seen. This movie is really worth watching I definitely recommend it to everyone."
01.12.2024,10.0,"The epitome of excellence in Hollywood, ""Back to the Future"" is timeless, inspiring, and memeable. The pace here is seamless, every moment has plot significance, and every word uttered is valuable and meaningful. This careful crafting of visual presentation, audible experience and narrative concept existed at a time of relative peace and stability in the American economy. Little did we know everything would go downhill from here: an era of complete uncertainty leading to massive corporate greed, a sharp drop in production quality, and an industry absorbed by politics instead of artform. The laisse faire attitude of 80s Hollywood management allowed for more directorial creativity and oversight, compared to the complicated and overzealous requirements demanded by today's itchy fingered producers and executives.""Back to the Future"" deals with very common human issues such as self-esteem, effort and maturity, all while presenting an intriguing premise, pressing matters, romance, friendship and conflict all rolled into one. If the definition of Art is ""the mirror we hold up to ourselves"" (Shakespeare, Hamlet), then the imitation of nature that this science fiction dramedy presents is among the best in the craft of filmmaking: It's not about the science or the fiction; it's about people.Today's world poses many threats to studio success: legal action can be taken if your production presents defamatory or misleading information; social backlash can arise from a lack of respect to the genre or franchise; studio acceptance can be jeopardized from simple misrepresentation of race or gender... what we have now is a literal minefield of judicial hurdles, social media timebombs and the precarious balancing of identity politics over qualification and competence in hiring. Its no wonder, then, that activists, poles, statistics and even artificial intelligence have taken center stage in the development of studio projects: every obstacle to success must be accounted for. The excessive hand holding has led to a soulless industry, one so obsessed with minutia, that its now incapable of seeing the forest from the trees. Art has completely left the building, replaced by obligation to pretense and the third quarter. Hopefully, future generations will rely on past productions, such as this one, for inspiration, guidance, and understanding of the human experience."
29.11.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is a near-perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, and adventure, earning high praise for its clever storytelling, memorable characters, and infectious energy. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg, this iconic film has stood the test of time, captivating audiences with its creativity and timeless appeal.The story follows teenager Marty McFly, played with charm and charisma by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a time machine invented by the eccentric Dr Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd. Marty's quest to return to 1985 becomes a race against time as he inadvertently disrupts his parents' first meeting, threatening his very existence.Fox delivers an effortlessly engaging performance, bringing humour and relatability to Marty as he navigates the past with a mix of resourcefulness and teenage awkwardness. Lloyd is equally outstanding as Doc, with his larger-than-life energy and wild-eyed enthusiasm creating one of cinema's most beloved characters. The dynamic between Marty and Doc is the heart of the film, with their unlikely friendship driving much of the story's charm.The script, co-written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, is a masterpiece of structure and wit, deftly weaving together humour, tension, and heartfelt moments. The way the film balances the high stakes of time travel with light-hearted comedy is nothing short of genius. From the hilariously awkward scenes with Marty's teenage mother to the nail-biting clock tower sequence, every moment feels perfectly calibrated.Alan Silvestri's iconic score amplifies the film's sense of adventure and wonder, while the 1980s rock hits, particularly Huey Lewis and the News' The Power of Love, give the film its unforgettable vibe. The production design is equally impressive, capturing both the 1980s and 1950s with meticulous attention to detail, making the time-jump feel immersive and authentic.The only minor drawback is that certain elements of the plot, particularly the more dated social dynamics, may not resonate as strongly with modern audiences. However, these moments do little to detract from the film's overall impact.In conclusion, Back to the Future is an endlessly entertaining and cleverly crafted film that continues to delight viewers of all ages. With its sharp humour, heartwarming story, and unforgettable performances, it has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films of all time. A near-flawless adventure that is as timeless as its title suggests."
21.11.2024,10.0,"Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack."
12.11.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is a film that holds a special place in my heart, and watching it again recently reminded me why it's such a timeless classic. From the moment the iconic DeLorean roars to life, I was transported back to a world where time travel is not just a fantasy, but a thrilling adventure. The film's blend of humor, science fiction, and heartwarming moments creates an experience that resonates with audiences of all ages.Michael J. Fox's portrayal of Marty McFly is nothing short of iconic. His youthful exuberance and relatable struggles make him an endearing protagonist. And then there's Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown, whose eccentricity and wisdom provide the perfect counterbalance to Marty's character. Their chemistry is electric, and every scene they share is filled with laughter and genuine emotion.The screenplay is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving together themes of friendship, family, and the consequences of our choices. I found myself laughing at the clever nods to the 1950s culture while also appreciating the film's deeper messages. The way it tackles the idea of altering one's own past and the ripple effects that can have is both thought-provoking and entertaining.The soundtrack, particularly the unforgettable theme by Alan Silvestri, adds an extra layer of magic to the film. It's one of those scores that sticks with you long after the credits roll, evoking a sense of nostalgia and adventure.Watching Back to the Future in a packed theater, surrounded by fellow fans, was an experience I'll cherish. The collective gasps, laughter, and cheers made me realize how this film transcends generations. It's a movie that sparks joy, ignites conversations, and leaves you with a smile on your face.In a world where films often come and go, Back to the Future remains a shining beacon of creativity and fun. It's a film I can revisit time and time again, discovering new nuances with each viewing. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience this cinematic gem. It's not just a movie; it's a journey through time that you won't want to miss."
09.11.2024,8.0,"Balancing Sci Fi with Comedy and Drama is one of the hardest combinations in the entertainment industry, and 'Back to the Future' nails it almost perfectly. The blend of wit, charm and consideration creates a tasty and wholesome family movie with a sense of consequence for the character's actions.Michael J. Fox is sensational, giving that comical edge to take the pressure off you while also feeling human and grounded. Christopher Lloyd is marvellous. Crispin Glover is beautiful as this pathetic man at the centre at it all. Tom Wilson makes his first appearance although out of the three he has the least impact.The sense of place and atmosphere is striking, largely due to great well lit cinematography and steady handed screenplay. It's textbook brilliance for the period and deserving as a cultural icon."
03.11.2024,9.0,"Probably one of the best, if not the best, trilogies ever made and also one of my personal favourites. Always had a soft spot for this film since I was a little kid.Watching the film I could not but think about the brilliance of the script and the direction. I always trust Tarantino on this, as he says, the perfect movie.I don't know what makes this film great: the concept, the performances, the chemistry between Marty and Doc, the music, the 80's setting, the sci-fi elements, the romantic comedy elements-or maybe it's all of that? How can all of those elements coexist in one single film without destroying it?I guess that that's what would happen today, and it is not what happened in 1985, certainly not when you have Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis around."
18.10.2024,9.0,"Great time travel DMC DeLorean , memorable characters and very likable dialogues. And one that will stick in your head for a long time is Doc! It's a fun and feel-good movie. I've watched it since I was a kid and I've watched it over 10 times now and I'm still not bored of it. It's a really good memory. Although the rest of the series are fun, the first series is still the best. But there might be a downside, maybe only in the Dub zone of my country, some words are not translated correctly, so I had to find the English version to watch. When watching both languages, it's fun in different ways."
17.10.2024,10.0,"I just got done watching Back to the Future (1985) for the first time ever and I absolutely loved every single minute of this movie.Positives for Back to the Future (1985):
The movie's premise is absolutely brilliant to where you have this boy going back in time and see what the world was like when his parents were teenagers. This is a premise that has been done multiple times since this movie first came out and while some of them have come close, none have been able to capture the magic of this original movie. The other thing that makes this movie work is the cast of characters and the actors portraying them. First off you have Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly who is easily one of the best movie characters in the history of cinema and he's one of those characters who you easily relate to because of his natural on-screen presence and charisma. Then you have Christopher Lloyd as Emmett ""Doc"" Brown and this guy is one of the most entertaining and ecentric characters that you can't help but love him. I also enjoyed Crispin Glover as George McFly and Lea Thompson as Lorraine Baines McFly and their interactions with Marty are so fun to watch. Then you have Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen is one of the most easy to hate villains in cinematic history and he's not even one of these evil cartoonish villains that we see a lot in movies, he's just a big mean bully in high school and we all hate those people. The movie's score by Alan Silvestri is easily among one of the movie scores I've heard in any movie. The special effects for the time-travel sequences are phenomenal and they still hold up to this day. And finally, I just how good-natured this movie is with its approach and it's one of those comfort movies that you can watch at anytime in your life.Overall, Back to the Future (1985) is one of the greatest movies of all time.amd if you haven't watched this movie yet and then you need to watch it as soon as possible."
10.09.2024,7.0,This movie is a lot of fun the whole way through I love doc and Marty is a fun protagonist. The idea of what's going on and time travel has probably happened a lot but it stems from this and you can see why I think the ending is super sweet and how it just has full confidence and is like oh we have an idea for a sequel too is great cause it shows they had fun doing this and will do more which is great cause nowadays sequels feel forced and undeserved but this is just a whole lot of fun and def deserving of a sequal i remember watching 2 & 3 when I was younger and I'm excited to revisit them this month before they leave Netflix.
08.09.2024,8.0,"Back to the Future is a movie ahead of its time, utilizing an array of incredible effects that were unseen for its era. The narrative is super simple yet captivating, with a well-constructed story that avoids leaving any plot holes. The performances are amazing, and it has become an iconic film in pop culture.Elements like the Delorean and the concept of a time machine through a car are very original and practical, featuring a highly empathetic and human protagonist, with flaws and merits. The only downside to the film is certain sexist aspects of the time, based on the culture in which it was released."
07.09.2024,10.0,"Classic one of my favorite childhood movie, Literally, one of the best serious picture of all time. I have been watching this movie so many times, including the movie. The other the fantasy is going back literally one of the greatest idea. The acting is phenomenal and the effect horse back at the time revolutionary. I wish the day really did another movie in the series, this movie is enjoyable and it's not too long. It's perfect in terms of timing. I don't understand why all the new movies it's over three hours and you can really make movie in 90 minutes., Recommended to all the young generation that did not grew up on this movie."
06.09.2024,9.0,"Great 80's film. Hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually.9/10."
05.09.2024,10.0,"Back to the Future is one of those very nostalgic films.I remember exactly the day I received a box set with the three films from a friend of my mother. As it was late at night, I couldn't run the marathon. The next day I watched them all and immediately fell in love.All the settings, characters and stories leave everything characteristic and original, mainly due to the time in which it was made.Michael J. Fox Christopher Lloyd form a duo with perfect chemistry. No wonder they are called for interviews and lectures about the three films to this day.If there's one tip I can give to parents of children old enough to understand the story, it's: don't waste any more time, have a movie session at home to watch these three classics of world cinema with your children."
05.09.2024,10.0,"This is how a movie should be done. It's perfection from start to finish. I remember the first time that I saw it and I remember my house, the tv, the food that I was eating the happiness the nostalgia. If anyone doesn't like Back to the future he/she must be empty inside. There's no way to not love this perfection.The cinematography the story the comedy the actors everything is perfect and there's even 1 second of the movie that is boring. Everything is fast paced.

25.08.2024,9.0,"I love this film and can rewatch it every day if I can. The critiques of this film usually have a complaint about the ""scifi"" aspect of it, whether it justifies the science behind time travel or not. I would say that Back to the Future is like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. It falls more on the adventure-comedy genre than science-fiction. Everything that's happening here taken place in a fifth dimension that is beyond science and superstition.You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination."
23.08.2024,10.0,"I recently watched Back to the Future (1985) on Netflix. The storyline follows Marty McFly, a high school student dealing with the fallout of his father being bullied by his boss, which affects the entire family dynamic. His best friend, a quirky scientist, has been working on a time travel experiment. When Marty is called to help test the invention, the experiment works-but with tragic consequences, as the scientist is killed, and Marty is accidentally sent back in time. Now, Marty must find a way to change the course of history to help his family while also figuring out how to return home.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), the film stars Michael J. Fox (Teen Wolf), Christopher Lloyd (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), Lea Thompson (Howard the Duck), Crispin Glover (Willard), and Tom Wilson (Action Jackson).Back to the Future is 80s nostalgic gold in every way-storyline, characters, soundtrack, comedic elements, and its optimistic take on the core premise. The entire film is beautifully written, with Marty McFly being an easy character to root for. Michael J. Fox perfectly captures Marty's carefree and fun-loving nature. Crispin Glover delivers an underrated performance as Marty's quirky dad, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as the eccentric scientist. The depiction of the 1950s is pure fun, and the idea of a son inadvertently impacting his parents' relationship is both clever and engaging. The weaving together of time travel and family plots comes together seamlessly, culminating in a heartwarming full-circle ending. The Huey Lewis and the News soundtrack is iconic, and it's impossible not to love this film.In conclusion, Back to the Future is wholesome American cinematic gold and an absolute must-see. I would score it a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
16.08.2024,5.0,"This story is essentially a small, weak, dumb kid sort of accidentally travels back in time, makes irrationally bad decisions and then somehow triumphs in the end.When I saw this movie as a kid I thought it was pretty silly but fun, and if I was writing IMDB reviews in the 90s I probably would have rated it a 7/10. For anyone with a mind remotely based in science or logic nearly everything comes off too stupid or illogical to enjoy this movie. Marty McFly makes a terrible decision in nearly every situation and seems to keep forgetting that he traveled back In time. I can see how the bottom half of the population would identify with this idiotic protagonist and how some fan boys would love these movies despite their flaws, but I don't understand how anyone not in those categories could rate any of these movies above a 6.Some specifics that I don't think qualify as spoilers:
-Marty's family photo (from the ""future"") starts to fade based on his actions. This makes ZERO sense; if you altered your future and negated your existence, you wouldn't exist and the photo wouldn't exist. If they wanted to try and make scientific sense it would have been more like Schrödinger's Cat where Marty disappears intermittently and the photo changes.-After traveling back in time Marty seems to never remember he came from the future and makes every silly blunder possible to create issues for himself. He makes no attempt to blend in when it matters most, and in every situation he seems just as confused and flabbergasted that he's in the last, even though it's very clear he knows he is. It's sort of like he's willfully ignorant and is pretending to not remember he went back in time at only the worst times (aka bad writing)."
05.08.2024,10.0,"This is the greatest movie I have ever seen, my favorite of all time. I just love this movie so much. It has everything a great movie needs. A great cast, a great script, great characters, great plot, great scenes, great everything. From the beginning to the end, it is amazing. I just get a great, indescribable feeling when I watch it. Every time I can, I view it. There is quite literally nothing wrong with it. As Michael J. Fox said, ""It's ironic that a movie about time travel is timeless."" I totally agree. I hope, some day, I can show my children this movie, and they will love it as well. And as Forrest Gump said (which is kinda ironic because Robert Zemeckis directed both Forrest Gump and Back To The Future,) ""That's all I have to say about that."""
22.07.2024,10.0,"*Back to the Future* is more than just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that captures the essence of imagination and adventure in a way that transcends generations.

05.07.2024,10.0,"I haven't watched this in years, but our family is watching movies this holiday and Back to the Future series is up.And it holds up. Or, rather, it holds up enough, because obviously someone editing the same movie in 2024 might make a few other choices.On the other hand, I see plenty that is superior to the fare we regularly get now.Of course, Michael J Fox is a favorite, but how fun to see the entire cast in ensemble and remember how talented each casting choice was.The music is just exceptional in this series, substantial but fun, lifting and carrying the chase sequences especially.It's funny to see product placement in a movie I think of as a box office hit and even legendary. However, the placements themselves almost add to the fun as we look at the 1980's looking at the 1950's from the vantages of the 2020's. (What a trip.)"
05.07.2024,9.0,"This is literally my reason for being fascinated by scifi movies. This movie is a gem and it deserves atleast a *9* from me. Out of all the Pros of the film, I may summarise them as :
1. Vfx is top notch for its time.2. After watching Alan Silvestri's name, you don't need to analyse more on the music stuff.3. Rhe plot is well written and well executed. No potholes, or bad/awkward moments.4. Screenplay was good.5. Even if the plot has extreme situations, good writing makes it better.This is, as far as I'm concerned, the best time travel movie I've witnessed.Lets appreciate it and give the makers what they deserve."

02.07.2024,10.0,"Why did they remove the half fence from all 3 of the movies, it added a different twist to the endings and kept everything in the correct court?I am now 73. Saw BTTF when it was first released. Instant classic, even if the so-called experts didn't see it at that time. Perfect foreshadowing. Perfect acting, not only by the major stars, but also by the bit players - Goldie Wilson, the clock tower lady, Lorraine's parents, Strickland, Dave and Linda, Marvin Berry, the Peabody family (you killed a pine!). Perfect dialogue with many repeatable and memorable lines or phrases - butthead, flux capacitor, what's a rerun?, who the hell is John F. Kennedy, give me a milk - chocolate, I'm your density, 1.21 giggawats, 88 miles per hour, we don't need roads, etc. Silvestri's score is one of the most recognizable in cinema history. When supplemented with Huey Lewis hits , and the Starlighter's songs, the music is also a perfect fit. Truly an iconic film which has, and will always remain one of the greatest feel good movies ever."

24.06.2024,10.0,"The Delorian is such a fun vehicle and I love the way they use it in this movie! Ten stars for sure. It reminds me of when I was a kid and when my father would quote the scenes from the movie. Michael did an amazing job as Marty McFly in Back to the Future. It will always remind me of the good old days when my pops says ""Roads, where we're going, we don't need roads."". And ""I finally invented something that works."" Haha. I would really like to see another version of this movie come out now! I hope that they come out with one eventually because it was absolutely amazing. 10/10. Anyways, great movie!"
23.06.2024,9.0,"Modern movie makers have so much to learn from this movie. After 15min everything is setup, we know all the characters, the later pay off is ready to go, and everything is well written, no dialogue is wasted and there are no modern sensitivity issues. And, although we do not know it watching this movie, the sequels are already setup too. Great filmmaking.The movie has great pace, a lot of things happen, but everything feels logical and to the point.A few negatives of course. Especially from a modern point of view. The computer graphics do not hold up, some of the time travel shenanigans does not work (since we know what happens in ""the future""). But perhaps the only real negative is how campy and basic everything feels. I also feel the sets are not always on point.From one of the best movie years of all time, 1985, this classic and mastery of filmmaking is of course to this day still very much watchable.A 9/10 and a must see for every lover of great cinema."
18.06.2024,7.0,"In the mid-1980s, screenwriters Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had a great idea. Wouldn't it be fun to make a film about a young guy who travels back in time and meets his own parents? When his folks are also teenagers, that is? Unfortunately, their enthusiasm was not shared by a single soul in Hollywood. No one wanted to invest money in such a whacky project. But then, when Zemeckis scored a hit with ""Romancing the Stone"" everything changed. Suddenly every studio in town wanted to do business with the two friends.Robert Zemeckis started shooting ""Back to the Future"" in November 1984. From the beginning, Eric Stoltz was supposed to have the lead role. But although Stoltz was an excellent actor, the director soon realized that he wasn't the right man for the part. So, Zemeckis turned instead to Michael J. Fox, star of the immensely popular sitcom ""Family Ties"". And luckily, Fox was keen to do the job. Even though it meant working on two gruelling projects at the same time.When Michael J. Fox sets off on his time-traveling trip, he uses a gleaming, modified DeLorean. However, that wasn't the case in Zemeckis and Gale's original script. The two authors had actually intended that the journey would start in a converted refrigerator (?) out in the hero's kitchen. Soon, however, the two scriptwriters realized that this could cause problems. Imagine if some kid was inspired by the movie and got trapped inside the family's fridge.Not surprisingly, ""Back to the Future"" became a smash hit, even surpassing ""Romancing the Stone"" at the box office. The film also made Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale the hottest scriptwriting team in Hollywood. In addition, John DeLorean sent a letter thanking the filmmakers for immortalizing his futuristic car. But the biggest proof of the movie's popularity was that Universal Pictures installed ""Back to the Future"" rides in their theme parks in California and Florida."
15.06.2024,8.0,"I saw this movie enough times I lost count. I don't want to watch ""Back to the Future"" ever again unless there is a version which has Elisabeth Shue in on it ;) I like the first movie a lot, but it isn't the best movie in the series. The best character in this movie is that little, dog Einstein who seem to have started this adventure in the first place :) I wanted to see more of this dog. The second best character in this movie is none other than Doc I reckon who still looks the same in 1985 :) And so does Mr Strickland :) I like George in this movie, but I wanted him to be a man. George was too much of a wimp! I did like the other characters especially Biff Tannen, the bully, but I wanted to see Biff's Grandma :) Even what the inside of his home looks like. You saw Biff's garage. I like manure also :) Back to the Future is an excellent movie. 9/10."
13.06.2024,10.0,"Definitely NOT the best movie ever made, kinda sloppy and barely cracks top 15. It is indeed simple and superficial, plus I gotta agree on the fact that this might not be actual science fiction. Still, my childhood thrived on this franchise and I still get excited rewatch after rewatch. Furthermore, this movie was the first piece of fiction to make me love the 50s and 80s and in general vintage culture.So, if I have to rate cold-blooded on technical quality only, without letting feelings interfere? Well, I'm afraid it's a 6 at best.But if I have to be honest, cinema is more than just technique, so from the heart I'd say it's a 10.And only a chicken wouldn't follow his heart."
11.06.2024,7.0,"I recently watched a movie with a simple linear story in the time travel genre that I found really enjoyable. The movie revolves around a teenage boy named Marty who helps a scientist named Doc Brown test his time machine. However, Marty ends up traveling back in time and has to find his way back to the present.The movie's plot, while simple, still holds up and can be quite enjoyable. However, I felt that compared to more recent time-travel movies with complex and interesting storylines, this one may seem a bit basic. The plot revolves around a teen helping another teen get his dream girl and stand up to his bully but with time travel involved. This plot didn't work for me. But I didn't regret watching it.The acting in the movie was generally good, although I felt that the actors who played George and Lorraine overacted in their scenes. The cinematography was impressive for its time, and the music added to the overall enjoyment of the film. The pacing of the movie was just right, not too fast or slow.Overall, I found the movie fun to watch, but I was hoping for a more complex or thrilling storyline, rather than the teen drama that it turned out to be. I'd rate this movie a 7 because of its simple plot, but otherwise, it's a good watch."
04.06.2024,10.0,"Generation spanning movie. Kids, teens, adults, olders all love it. It has no wasted scenes, no bad dialog really, and no reliance on special effects.I can't really think of another movie so perfect for what it was. End Game maybe as the pinnacle super hero movie to end the MCU reign maybe.Part 2 suffered from no Crispin Glover. He really had the great tones and mannerisms for a foil for Marty.Everyone knows at least some lines from this movie. Everyone literally. A true gem.I see local Deloreans set up to look like the car from this movie. It draws more visitors than a typical lambo. I just added the last paragraph, true as it is, to meet the character requirements of the review."

Honestly all the actions in this movie can be short films they're so entertaining! #2 the score, Alan Silversti is a musical prodigy, every theme suits the moment and character, my favorite is Marty's letter it's so beautiful it has so much heart and emotion. #3 the development. The development in the characters is amazing, everyone gets a moment to shine, my favorite is George McFlys because he finally grew a pair and stood up to biff in a badass way. #4 set up and pay off. Set up and pay off is a very common thing to find in a script but for whatever reason not a lot of them use them, but THIS movie REALLY knows how to use it, Every single character or something in the background gets a time to shine, even things you won't even think about!

10.04.2024,9.0,"I just watched Back to the Future (1985), a sci-fi comedy in which a teenager called Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is transported to 1955 by a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his scientist buddy Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd).The movie is an excellent blend of humor and action. Marty's 80s fashion clash with 50s style is funny, as are his attempts to fit in. The unexpected bond Marty has with his parents is at the center of the story. He views them in a completely new light, recognizing that they weren't always boring grownups.Back to the Future isn't all fun and games. It cleverly delves into issues of family, destiny, and the strength of friendship. The special effects, while not mind blowing by today's standards, but it hold up surprisingly well and perfectly capture the magic of time travel. This movie is a timeless classic. It's a crowd-pleaser with something for everyone action, laughs, and a touch of heartwarming sentimentality."
07.04.2024,9.0,"Who else could have played these characters? Each character was perfectly cast, acted and memorably written. Equally memorable is the timeless story, exciting pacing, comedy and music. The only real problem is why Doc and Marty are friends. They make a great team, but have nothing in common. Marty doesn't want to be a scientist and Doc Brown isn't a musician or was one. How did they meet? I also don't know why Doc set the clocks 25 minutes slow. He didn't know Marty was coming over. In fact, one of the clocks on the ground by the plutonium case is still correct time. The DeLorean time machine is still cool and so is the rest."
29.03.2024,10.0,"Just kidding! It is one of the best films ever made. Lea Thompson was so hot. I would ""park"" with her anyday of the week, and twice on Sundays. Doc Brown is hypocritical about knowing too much about one's own future. It is weird that Marty McFly (presumably a minor in high school) is friends with a single old man scientist. Crispin Glover is probably the best part of the movie. That dude is ultra strange! I want to see the Eric Stolz version of the film. He apparently was Marty originally and filmed a lot of the movie before he was replaced by poor Parkinson poster-boy Michael J. Fox. Truly sad what happened to Fox in real life. He was a rising star and could have done a lot more with his career. But, such is life. 88 miles per hour!"

And at the last moment, they reveal this time loop as if it were a big thing and expect us to be amazed at their intelligence.I know it doesn't come close to being scientifically logical or perfect. But by using time travel as a tool, it tells a story with heart, about friendship, family, love, courage, and adding great comedy elements. All the acting is very successful. Especially Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd perform phenomenal performances while making you feel the friendship between the young man and the mad scientist that will warm your heart."

It cleverly intertwines elements of adventure, comedy, and drama, showcasing the journey of Marty McFly, who is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean created by his eccentric friend, Dr. Emmett Brown. While the concept of time travel was brilliantly executed, offering a fresh take on the genre, some aspects, like the exaggerated confrontation with the Libyans, felt overly dramatized and slightly disconnected from the storyline. Despite a few narrative discrepancies, the film remains an entertaining experience, rich in creativity and filled with memorable moments that have stood the test of time.

07.01.2024,8.0,"I recently enjoyed watching the iconic film Back to the Future, and it was nothing short of amazing. The storyline was captivating, with every scene building up the tension and making me want to know what happens next. The characters were incredibly well-developed, and their unique personalities and quirks made them all the more relatable and memorable.One of the things that stood out to me was the attention to detail in the time-travel aspect of the movie. Seeing how the filmmakers managed to weave in all the little details and make it all seem believable was awe-inspiring. The result was an engaging and entertaining movie that kept me on the edge of my seat.I particularly loved the chemistry between the characters and the humor sprinkled throughout the film. Michael J.

03.01.2024,,"In the 1980s, an experiment by a weird scientist turns out to be faulty. It leads to his teenaged pal going back in time to the 1950s where he is forced to reunite the younger version of his parents. The movie is, for better and sometimes for worse, a rich, fascinating document of the era that produced it. President Reagan was famously a huge fan, and not just because we see one of his films - ""Cattle Queen of Montana,"" the 1954 Western in which he starred opposite Barbara Stanwyck - being advertised on a 1955 Hill Valley theater marquee. With its extended flashback to the '50s from the vantage of the '80s, ""Back to the Future"" taps into the very ethos of the Reagan presidency, or part of it anyway: a spirit of pioneering technological advancement married to a wellspring of nostalgia for ostensibly simpler times."
01.01.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is an undisputed classic of cinema and science fiction as a whole. The film still works as an entertaining work, however, that doesn't mean it isn't a product of its time. The way the narrative is executed, the comedy is inserted and even how the visuals are displayed is, without a shadow of a doubt, dated. Does this mean that the work is bad seen through today's eyes? No. The work well portrays its time and the vision of the future that society had. Everything here is a huge reflection of the 80s. Even so, the work doesn't become any less thought-provoking and fun. Every film will always be dated when seen decades later, but that doesn't make it bad.The film, from the beginning, tells the viewer, in an indirect way, what will happen at the end of this story. This is one of the strong points of this film. Back to the Future thinks about many details to make the story round, even if the script falls into problems presented in works that explore time travel. The most important detail of the narrative is exactly how everything is extremely connected. All the scenes presented during the film are important for the development of the narrative and show importance again throughout it. Small details shown in small scenes always return to close the story in a satisfactory way and still leave a hook for a continuation.During many moments the small details presented are not said by the characters, but shown by small images in the foreground. The film takes advantage of small occasions to develop the narrative for the viewer, even though these details often don't seem important at first. Some scenes perfectly demonstrate the differences between the past and future using only the scenery and signs.Back to the Future is a brilliant work that marked its time and is still remembered today as a great classic. The film is extremely fun and its comedic moments are wonderful. The experience of watching this film is unique and becomes even more special when reviewed."

31.12.2023,10.0,"Back to the Future is directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film portrays Marty McFly, a high school student who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955, inadvertently disrupting his parents' first meeting and attracting his mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by rekindling his parents' romance and with the help of his eccentric inventor friend Doc Brown return to 1985.This movie is a phenomenal film. The music is fantastic. I love the song ""The Power of Love."" I love the storyline, the acting is fantastic, the comedy, and I love Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly. I love this movie so much."
20.12.2023,8.0,"Hey those days, hey..
I watched the movie, which is the same age as me, years ago, and I know that I loved it as far as I vaguely remember. It is one of the immortal works that leaves an entertaining taste in our subconscious whenever it is mentioned, just like Kemal Sunal's movies. Years later, yesterday, as a middle-aged person with children, I was at the market with my children. We watched it as a movie as a family. I'm sure my children felt similar feelings and maybe they will make a similar comment years later. It is definitely one of those productions that never gets old even after years pass.As for the film, it is one of the cornerstone films of cinema, one of the masterpieces of the master Robert Zemeckis. It is a very high-quality film in many aspects such as the scenario, acting, locations, decors, sequences, music, and clothes. It is a great film that is far ahead of the technology of that day, the likes of which I think are difficult to film even today. A movie... Immersiveness, excitement, action is always at the highest level and the tempo never slows down... Old movies had this aspect and I think this is the biggest deficiency of today's movies..."
13.12.2023,6.0,"To be honest, most of the time I understand the reason when a particular film is very highly appreciated by audiences and critics and at the same time is not my type. In this case, however, I do not find logic. Not that the film is bad. It's funny, it's watchable, and the main characters are colorful and memorable. Somehow, though, it didn't grab me all that much. I didn't find it super funny, adventurous or surprising enough. In short, nothing new under sky. Well, yeah, but that's not how most people feel.Weird.Well, at the end of the day, the important thing is that when we take the time to do something, we enjoy it as much as possible, and I'm glad that Back to the Future (1985) achieved that multiple times. In my case - I'm not disappointed, it was an OK movie, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it unless you're a fan of a particular person involved in this project or something like that.Final score: 6/10."
13.12.2023,10.0,"Great memorable movie. I like to watch that old man over and over again and he is constantly traveling through time. But the movie should have continued and newer episodes and series were made from it, but these versions are still popular with people after years, but the newer episodes can deal with modern technology and time travel. Maybe everything will be more attractive with the replacement faces of that old man, we like the new faces more and I hope it will be seen more and more. Film music can also be interesting. Pay attention to this series and produce new episodes with new actors that travel in time but also deal with new technology. Think about it along with music."
18.11.2023,9.0,"Back To The Future' is a great movie. It has an incredible energy and remains an ""innocent"" film. The music is great, and it has a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Some might argue that the time travel aspect is not plausible, but I think that's missing the point. The movie is meant to entertain, and it does that incredibly well. However, it's not just mindless entertainment. The film cleverly touches on some interesting themes and uses some ideas from Oedipus Rex's story in a funny way.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the mad scientist is hilarious, and Michael J. Fox completely embodies the character of Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy, and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is charming, and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is a timeless classic. It's been over 23 years since it was made, and it still has yet to lose its appeal. It's unfortunate that movies like this aren't made anymore, but thankfully, we can always revisit them. That's why they're classics."
16.11.2023,10.0,"Probably one of the greatest films ever made during the 80's, still holds up today. I can't think of anyone who grew up during my time that didn't love this film. A true classic, the story was great, along with the characters, and the soundtrack. It was the perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy,action. Doc Brown (Lloyd) invents a time machine using a DeLorean, to escape some Libyan terrorists after the Doc, McFly (Fox) goes back in time to 1955, and must use the assistance of 1955 Doc Brown to get back to 1985. Doesn't get much better than this as it appeals to all ages. Followed by 2 sequels part 2 is forgettable, but part 3 just as entertaining as original. 5/5."
13.11.2023,8.0,"What a classic gem this movie is
Yesterday, today and tomorrow
So many unforgettable lines and iconic scenes
Started today the trilogy and what a start this first movie is
Of course I knew the basics of the plot and even saw some scenes previous in life but now in watching the three movies no distractions from start to finish
The characters are awesome and the concept so pure. Very well executed considering it was the mid 80s
Marty and the Doc. What a Duo what a great movie
Back to the future is a classic movie from a classic saga that will remain relevant through the history of movies and makind."
13.11.2023,10.0,"Back to the future has fantastic characters and enjoyable story telling couldn't be better.The soundtrack is just perfect for the theme of the film. Michael J. Fox l did a spectacular job playing a relatable teenager living the dream. Christopher Lloyd's character Dr. Emmett Brown was very entertaining to watch I think he did a brilliant job with role and I believe no one could do it better.It makes me happy that 38 years later this film still hasn't lost its charm and holds a special place in people's hearts truly a timeless movie.Big thanks to Robert Zemeckis, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and the many others that made this movie possible.My favourite film till I die."
03.11.2023,8.0,"This film is a classic in its own right; Although it was not the first film to talk about time travel, it was the first to offer a lovable experience with funny characters where from various sources we obtained comic relief and at the same time the opportunity to embrace circumstances that our protagonists would experience. There are several sequences that have made history and the key for director Zemeckis is to offer, with his master pulse, a perfect form to an idea that in other hands would be mediocre. As a film it has not aged too well since we have become accustomed to the exaggeration resulting from the abundance of visual effects and the poverty of scripts that makes us more exquisite and impatient. Despite this, it is a good film in every sense."
01.11.2023,9.0,"Back to the future is a Classic movie that I've heard about for couple of times didn't really get the hype UNTIL nowThe Story is the BEST aspect of this movie the whole Back to the future idea is Very good ,Marty McFly and Doc are both amazing characters and very well written with some funny scenes here and there and there are a lot of chemistry between them which just makes this movie even more good and I want to note that the character development of those 2 are neat and well done.There are some Funny scenes here and there and I Really liked those and one of my favourite aspects of this very good movie.It has some very awkward scenes which are really interesting to see and quite laughable even though it's weird and if you see the movie you will know why there are some weird but good scenes 😆Overall SUCH an AMAZING adventure and I am looking forward to see the next one idk when but probably will see it because this movie is AMAZING! 9/10 DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!."
27.10.2023,9.0,"There are simply these films that have something magical about them. The magic of cinema - images, stories, characters that could enchant you, especially as a child. You were immersed in another world and sat in front of the TV with your mouth open. That was exactly the feeling I had when I saw ""Back To The Future"" for the first time.And the amazing thing is that I can still feel this feeling today when I watch the films.Even when the first notes of the magnificent score are heard, I get goose bumps.Immediately I am carried away into a world where I feel at ease and can forget everything around me. Hardly any other film has such an incredible charm as ""Back To The Future"" and its successors.This first film in particular is close to perfection for me. You can't tell a time travel story much better, more charming, wittier, more exciting, more intelligent than Robert Zemeckis does in this film. The plot is brilliant from beginning to end and there is not one scene that I find unnecessary or don't like.In addition, the strip offers simply incredible highlights, where you would like to rewind right away. For example, the appearance of Marty when he plays ""Johnny B. Goode"" at the ball, just fabulous. Or the skateboard scene, great.But not only the individual scenes, but in general this atmosphere, especially in the later course, when the action takes place in the 50s, is wonderful with the very beautiful backdrops. With Marty McFly and Doc Brown, of course, you have one of the most iconic movie duos of all time anyway, and with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, two outstanding actors who play it so well that they will forever be associated with these roles of a lifetime.Conclusion: Is there such a thing as the perfect film? Probably not, but ""Back To The Future"" is for me probably a strip that comes closest to it. And the best thing is that there are two more parts to follow, which are also really good and make up a totally round trilogy, which fortunately has been left as it is until today..."
24.10.2023,10.0,"Whenever I feel down and out about the present, I pop in the ol BTTF time machine, and am instantly transported to a better time, when things were only as serious as making sure the time continuum wasn't forever disrupted. Memorable characters, forever repeatable dialogue, and music that could make even Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan sing with glee! Having only first watched this one on VHS and not seeing it theaters, I can still feel that era whenever I catch this on tv. It is the encapsulated pleasures and atmosphere of all things 1980's. If only we had those hoverboards and self-lacing shoes by now...10/10."
18.10.2023,7.0,"My whole entire life I've had to hear what a masterpiece 'Back to the Future' is. Well, after 32 years I thought it's about time I finally watched it. Is it a masterpiece? No. It's a perfectly fine movie is what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.It's also a sign of the times. Similar to 'Indiana jones', people think it's a better film than what it is because 80s movies were so incredible bland. Time travel offers up a huge range of opportunities in terms of directions to go with your film. This film barely scrapes the barrel.Also the stakes never feel very high. The nature of the film is incredibly safe and so any audience member with half a brain knows exactly how everything is going to turn out.Truly great films have you on the edge of your seat. I never felt that way in this movie. I was simply along for the very safe ride.All that said, it's not a bad film. It just isn't what people think it is. 7/10."
16.10.2023,10.0,"One of the best movies I have seen, I like it a lot and every time I have time I watch it again, I really like the role that all the actors have, they give a special touch to the movie, everything is very similar to what one was actually in. Future it would be great if one day something like this could be done in real life.The roles that I like the most are the doctor, Martin and Biff, they are great at acting and they contributed a lot to this film, they gave it more essence, I think that without them the film would not be what it has been in this film for all time.I liked all 3 parts but the one I liked the most was the first because it made that introduction for what awaited us later with this great success."

12.09.2023,8.0,This is a spectacular film. A real classic in time. The storyline is terrific. I very much enjoyed watching this film. This is a great film for all viewers to watch. The cast selection is really precise and sensational.

12.09.2023,10.0,"Here in 2023 Back to the Future remains in the top 250 highest rated movies on IMDB and it is not difficult to see why. It's Great Scott, considering the technology and advancements the film industry has made since the year 1985, believe me this movie still holds its own. It is undoubtedly well written and entertaining and funny at times. Mostly bringing science fiction meets the adventurious with a dab of comedy to tiggle your taste buds.I remember as a young boy experiencing the ride in Universal Studios which only excelled my love for the films even more so. The DeLorean, i remember feeling the experience of being inside it all them years ago on the ride and let me tell you it was magical. The chemistry between the main protagonist Marty Mcfly and Doc Brown in contrast sets a tone of a father like son relationship with overwhelming love thrown in for good measure. On opposite sides of the coin yet on common ground of feeling outcast oddballs, somewhere down the timeline it just works so good. Every kids imagination is brought to life whilst every adult wonders of what they would do if given the opportunity to time travel. Back to the Future is the pinnacle of the time travelling genre in film, it invented the wheel and if it didn't it certainly took it further than ever before.Michael J. Fox is Marty McFly, there is no debate on that. I hear tellings of how they had to re-shoot scenes of Mcfly throughout the entire movie because the man they originally cast for Mcfly didn't get the character, or wasn't what they wanted. Christopher Lloyd plays the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown exquisitely conveying everything from mad scientist, to level headed thoughts of wisdom. The portrayal needless to say is spot on.Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have constructed a story for the ages that will truly stand the test of time and you will find yourself 'the audience' going Back to the future time and time again!"
08.09.2023,8.0,"Back to the Future is like the ultimate high-concept comedy adventure that takes you on a wild ride through the space-time continuum. We've got this guy Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) who's basically just trying to survive high school and keep his quirky family from turning into a bunch of losers. But then, he stumbles upon the eccentric Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who's like the love child of Einstein and a tornado. Doc's got a DeLorean, a flux capacitor, and a crazy plan to go back in time. Yeah, it's as nuts as it sounds.Marty and Doc jump in that stainless steel DeLorean and end up in the '50s, where things get... heavy. Marty has to make sure his parents fall in love or risk erasing his own existence. Talk about awkward family dynamics! But you know what's not awkward? The '80s and the '50s in a mashup and the hilarity that ensues! Marty and Doc are the ultimate odd couple, and their chemistry is electric. You just can't help but root for them, even when things get as complicated as deciphering the intricacies of alternate timelines, parallel universes, and the ever-elusive whereabouts of a misplaced almanac.But what really gets me is how this movie manages to balance sci-fi, comedy, and heart in one helluva entertaining package. You've got the classic '80s nostalgia dripping from every scene, and Marty's struggle to fit into the '50s is both hilarious and touching. The film's plot and pacing is so spot-on, and the script is full of clever time-travel paradoxes that'll make your head spin faster than the DeLorean's tires. Back to the Future takes us on a wild ride through the past, present, and future, all while serving up more laughs than 1.21 gigawatts of fun. It's got nostalgia, adventure, and that oh-so-'80s soundtrack. And let's not forget about that Johnny B. Goode guitar solo. It's a time-traveling, laugh-inducing, heart-warming adventure that'll have you shouting, ""Great Scott!"" in no time. So grab your hoverboard, put on your red puffer vest, and get ready to experience a classic that's as '80s as a Rubik's Cube and as funny as Doc Brown's hair on a windy day."
01.09.2023,10.0,"As I am familiar with Back to the Future I thought about wanting to look at it. As the film became the 30th Anniversary in 2015, the three films became a 30th Anniversary Trilogy celebrating the release of the first film which gained massive praise from critics and audience. Yes, I watched the whole trilogy in one day, believe or not, but I'm going to get these two later until I'm finished with the first film. Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back in time from 1985 to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes his mother's romantic interest. Dr. Emmett Brown aka. Doc, played by Christopher Lloyd, his friend and the inventor of the time-traveling DeLorean automobile, who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985. OK, so what people love about this film that has sense nowadays that I know this is a popular film and definitely the most popular Back to the Future film out of the trilogy. I love the story for what they've achieved with the first act where the story of the characters saying about what happened back in 1955 and when Marty is traveled in that year it goes what they usually do but not for Marty McFly 'cause he got hit by a car instead of George and now Lorraine, played by Lea Thompson, who now has the hots for him. Yeah, kinda weird while you think about it. For what I didn't know is that this film is used in pop culture such as what is ""Rick and Morty"" and that's all I know about that. I love the characters in which Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd plays along with the other actors. They both play fan favourite characters like Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is a typical teenager who accidentally went back in time in 1955 and he wants to get back in the year 1985. From what I heard that Michael J. Fox has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease which kinda sucks but he did continued work. Christopher Lloyd for many people know as an eccentric scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown aka. ""Doc"" who built the time machine made from the DeLorean and is my favourite character of the film. I bet many of you know his quotable line is ""Great Scott!"" Lea Thompson plays an innocent Lorraine McFly who falls for Marty and his mother in 1985. Crispin Glover is George McFly who is a teenager in 1955 and Marty's father in 1985. And then Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen, many people known him as the best character in franchise. His bully type really does suit the character really well and he throws in one of his catchphrases like ""What are you looking at, butthead?"", ""So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?"" and he hates being covered in manure. Also, I've heard the song ""The Power Of Love"" by Huey Lewis & The News and this is a good song. Christopher Lloyd appears in the music video as Doc Brown from the movie but what really caught me is Huey Lewis made a cameo appearance as one of the teachers. There's also a scene where Marty sings ""Johnny B. Goode"" by Chuck Berry. Yes, this song is in the 50's. In fact, Chuck was thinking about doing this song back in the mid 50's, believe it or not. You know, as much of these sci-fi movies that are popular at the time. Back to the Future is one of those movies you will have to see in the lifetime. It has great directing, fantastic writing, memorable characters, great performances and good effects. It boosted Robert Zemeckis' career up like he directed Romancing the Stone. This is one of my favourite films and my favourite sci-fi film of all time much like what others think of it when they put it in their Top 10 or many number movies. Do not miss this movie. Stay tuned for Back to the Future Part II. ""Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."""
29.08.2023,10.0,Whenever I am feeling down or sick or bored or happy or just feel like a good movie I turn to Back to the Future. It helps that this is a fairly family friendly movie that won't be too much for little ones watching. However my little thinks it's boring. Probably cuz I have made her watch it too many times to count.This is just a perfect movie in my opinion. Back in the 80's when they knew comedy didn't necessarily meant non stop fart jokes OR even that a comedy can be serious at times.The acting is top notch and has cemented Lloyd and Fox as one of my favorite acting duos of all time.Lots of action and adventure to be had can't recommend it enough.
18.08.2023,9.0,"(1985) Back To The Future
SCIENCE- FICTION/ ADVENTURE/ COMEDYCo-written and directed by Robert Zemeckis, fun science fiction adventure, and quite original any underdog can identify with centering on a chance to change the unsatisfying life one is experiencing into a better one by driving a time traveling car. Michael J Fox is perfect for the role who is unathletic and the only normal one in his family and Crispen Glover is perfect as the geeky dad, George McFly whose trying to provide the best for his family and Christopher Llyod is convincing as the kooky scientist after his likable persona he created while he was on the hit show ""Taxi""! Interesting note that the scene which involved the skateboarding scene while hanging onto the end of a vehicle doesn't really work in real life for I remembered someone once tried to mimic that stunt in real life during the time of this film's popular release and he ended up in the hospital and not functioning the same, meaning that it's one of those things that can be made possible in films but shouldn't be done in real life."
11.08.2023,10.0,"I like the Back To The Future series. They are very interesting plots to keep you wanting to watch from start to end. Not a lot of movies can do that but when you start watching Back To The Future you want to stay until it's over. You don't want to have to get up and down multi tasking. You will want to sit down and watch the movie. Maybe make some popcorn and grab a drink so it will be like you are at the theatre watching. I don't want to give away any spoilers so I won't go into detail, but Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) goes back in time and he has to be extra careful not to do anything that could alter the time line before he gets to go back to his time. Woth the watch."
07.08.2023,9.0,"It was an adventure of classic proportions Robert Zemeckis created when he combined clever time-travel writing with a wonderful mixture of 1950s Americana worship and an era-defining depiction of 1980s youth culture - a tribute to skateboards and walkmans. Amidst Michael J. Fox' youthful energy, Christopher Lloyd's in-your-face eccentricity and Crispin Glover's wonderful idiosyncrasy, Back to the Future did a magnificent job bridging the generation gap for mid-80s youngsters, whom John Hughes would claim weren't being understood by their parents in The Breakfast Club a few weeks later. In Back to the Future, it's arguably the other way around, but the end-result of Zemeckis' bridge-building is in many ways the same; an insight into the fact that being a hormonal teenager presented many of the same challenges in the 1950s as it did in the 1980s, or the 2020s, for that matter. And Back to the Future also keeps you completely, A-to-Z entertained by throwing impressive visuals and savvy antics at you from start to finish. A perfect film for parents and kids, even today."
06.08.2023,8.0,"Oh, what does one say about 'Back to the Future'? I might as well say just one word and conclude my review: CLASSIC!Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly - just a regular kid who dreams of becoming a rock star. His girlfriend is Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) and his best friend is the eccentric inventor Professor Doc (Emmett) Brown (wonderfully portrayed by Christopher Lloyd). His Mom is a bit conservative, although she doesn't mind a shot of Vodka, while his Dad is (sadly) a real loser, and has been a pushover since high school.One evening Doc shows Marty his latest invention - a time machine, built in a DeLorean. Doc obtained plutonium required for his time machine to work from Libyan terrorists, who are in pursuit of him. When Doc is shot, and Marty fears for his own life, he jumps in the DeLorean and accidentally goes back in time to 1955. Here, Marty meets his parents before they were sweethearts, and things get more than just a bit awkward for Marty when his mom falls for him!Nothing in 'Back to the Future' happens by chance. This is an incredibly well set-up movie, and the dialogue is very important, so you have to pay close attention. Everything here has a purpose, and plays a pivotal part in the movie. From the clever script to the incredible production design, great visuals and superb acting, this is one of the best fantasy adventure comedies.'Back to the Future' has a truly unique concept for its time, and certainly stood the test of time. Even by today's standards, the film still looks amazing. Off course, the fact they mostly used practical effects instead of CGI also makes a huge difference. Back when the movie came out, no doubt everyone wanted a (time-traveling) DeLorean!!I loved the way everything went wrong, and how everything fell into place again. And what a wonderful climax. This is an entertaining movie for the whole family!"
05.08.2023,10.0,"This is the film that took Michael J. Fox from television to the big screen.A 1980s teen is accidentally transported back thirty years to his parents high school days in a time machine that his inventor friend created.Marty McFly (Fox) is your typical teenager. He's friends with a local scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd)who creates a time machine out of a Delorian.Marty is accidentally transported back to 1955. With no way to get home he must track down Doc Brown to see if he can help him get Back to the Future, while trying not to interact with his future parents. Any interactions could alter the course of the future.This is a great film. One of my favorites for sure. The whole cast does a great job."
03.08.2023,10.0,"I love Back to the Future. Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time and will always be. I can rewatch this movie a hundred times and still never get bored with it.The acting is terrific overall in all the movies. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma and born for the role. Lea Thompson is beautiful and great, and Tom Wilson as the villain 'Biff' is absolutely hilarious.While having a typical 80s feel to it, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are surprisingly good without coming off as cheap. The comedy is funny and works.Will be rewatching for many many times."
02.08.2023,10.0,"To think that multiple studios denied to create this film, to it becoming one of the most loved and iconic sci-fi movies with a brilliant fan base, is bizarre. From the brilliant and inventive writing, to the great acting and performances, this film might be one of the best films.The visual effects and scenery in this film is astonishing, to the tiny details like Twin Pines mall becoming Lone Pine mall after Marty knocks down a palm tree in the past.To this day fans of the beloved franchise are still trying to decode secret timelines and easter eggs hidden in the corners of the film. I love Back to the Future."
27.07.2023,10.0,"The headline already gave it away, but to underline it properly: this is my favorite movie of all time and, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made.You have very few movies where everything comes together - this is one of this few. This movie has a great story, a great cast, well written characters, a great cinematic style and a fantastic soundtrack, including one of the best movie theme songs ever made.Do I even have to talk about the plot anymore?The tale of Marty McFly, the teenager who was accidentally sent back in time through the iconic DeLorean turned time machine, built by his friend Dr. Emmett Brown. He finds himself in his hometown, Hill Valley (what a name! There was a joke about that in the awesome BTTF game made by TellTale btw) 30 years in the past, in 1955. There, he meets his parents and accidentally prevents them from falling in love, which endangers his very own existence. Now he has to get them together while also getting back to 1985 through the help of the Doc Brown of the year 1955.It is a fairly simple premise, but the overall execution is sooo damn good that you don't really think about the simple nature of the story.I love this movie and I am so happy that Zemeckis and Gale still hold the rights to this film(s) close to their chest, because this is one of the film(s) that you really shouldn't try to remake, because it is simply impossible to top the original.10/10, would recommend."

08.07.2023,8.0,"I watched this in 2023 at the age of 21. I consider myself to have a pretty good understanding of what makes a movie great but also am listening to other opinions. I can easily understand why it's a classic, with likeable characters and a charming story. It's nothing special for me and was a bit cheesy, but yeah, it's just what happens over time. After listening to John Mulaney's joke on the movie I do have to say the premise is a bit odd and uncomfortable. Sometimes it can feel like things don't happen until the plot needs them to, but idk maybe I am being too harsh on it. People told me that it was absolutely incredible, but nah it's just a classic that's pretty feel-good and enjoyable honestly. Nothing much else."
27.06.2023,10.0,This is a great movie with amazing actors. Michael J. Fox was incredible. This is a movie about your life decisions and how it can affect your future. It has comedy and action my favorite combination. The main Character Marty is a teenager in High School and lives in a middle class neighborhood. His mother is big on family values and always tries to make it look as if she was a perfect teenager which we later find out is far from the truth. The father is a bit of a nerd and gets bullied around all of the time. It is a really great movie to watch with your family and it is one of the best movies of all time.
25.06.2023,10.0,"It was the best movie I watched as a kid. I still watch it occasionally. This is the first movie that comes to mind when I think of science fiction. The connection with all the films in the film series was the first thing that fascinated me. Most of the problems in today's movies are not present in this movie. There is no event like the ending of the movie based on a single event at the end of the movie. It is a movie that has been intertwined with many scenarios and these scenarios have been processed beautifully. The actors played well. In short, I think it's a much better movie than today's movies."
11.06.2023,7.0,"What do you say about one of the most entertaining films ever made? This movie is so beloved that I can't imagine anyone is coming to a review site to read what people think to get help deciding if they should see it or not. It's full of great characters, unique situations, and fun moments. It's packed with action and humor. Marty and the Professor are iconic roles performed wonderfully by the lead actors. Almost forty years later and BTTF is still a household name and part of our shared film culture. You see a Delorean, you think of this movie. It is endlessly satisfying to watch, and my only criticism is that there are one or two sequences that are drawn out for suspense that aren't really necessary. But that is just one guy's nitpick. Most people will find this to be a near-perfect viewing experience."

27.05.2023,8.0,"I will be judging the movie according to the date of this review. So for example: Even if the special effects are good for its time, they are above average for today. A gripping screenplay, sympathetic characters, iconic soundtrack, we can praise this movie until the morning, so I'm going to count the bad points because the rest is already very good. Even though I don't think there are too many bad things about the movie, there was one detail that caught my eye: Some of the chance events in the movie always seemed to happen in favor of our main character. I think this randomness undermines the credibility of the story, and even if it wasn't a bad thing, I wish we could have seen a scene about how Marty and Doc met (I know Bob Zemeckis explained it). I would like to thank everyone who worked on this movie for presenting us such a work of art and pay my respects."
05.05.2023,7.0,"Back to the Future follows Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), quite a fly guy indeed, that accidentally goes 30 years back in time, one-way ticket. Said accident happened the night that his friend, Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), introduced Marty his newest invention - a time machine. Now Marty, stuck in the past, is trying to figure out how he might come back to 1985, and doing so without erasing his own existence from the timeline - not an undifficult mission, I'll tell you that.Right off the bat, the film shows us one of its best aspects - the smooth flow. The movie is very well-paced, with little to no boring moments, in my opinion. Everything is entertaining, at least in some level, and scenes just fly by sometimes. I think that the Biff scene with the skateboard worked really well because of that thing exactly. Every little thing was fun there, and made the scene more fun to watch.The cinematography and score are both solid - nothing too experimental or unique, but both are very well-made and provide both memorable shots and musical moment, here and there. I think that the soundtrack itself is really fun as well - all the songs that carry hints of time travel, or the ""is it a dream?"" scene, which was definitely improved a lot due to the use of dream-related songs such as Mr. Sandman.I also like the whimsical, chaotic vibes that this film has. It gives the film more of a personality, and it makes the funny moments be much more potent and effortlessly good. Yeah, some time travel gags get a little tiresome, especially all the one liners about how Marty came from the future etc. (some are iconic, some are just a little cringe), but I'd still say that this movie does a good job when it comes to being chaotic in a funny, captivating way.Also, this movie is about how one needs to dare, to take a certain risk, in order to achieve true happiness. It's a cute message and it's delivered well. It doesn't blow me away, obviously, but it's woven into the film in many ways, and I feel like the movie really managed to make it the core, the heart of everything. I definitely appreciate that.There isn't a lot to say about this one - it's whimsical, simple and pretty fun to watch. It has many iconic lines, and the film just flows in a really satisfying way. The message of this film is present everywhere throughout it, and I can really appreciate the decent attention to detail there. Feeling a 7.2/10 on this one."
05.05.2023,10.0,"""Back To The Future"" is a fun and exciting movie that appeals to many people, even decades after it is release.This movie perfectly balances its comedic moments with an interesting plot, that kept me engaged and laughing throughout. The movie is really vibrant and completely captures the 80s feel.The story follows a teenager named Marty McFly, trying to return to his own time, while fixing the mistakes he has made when first arriving at 1955. McFly's hilarious and desperate attempts at trying to keep himself from being erased from existence led to many enjoyable comedic scenes.The memorable soundtrack also enhances the movie's lively and upbeat atmosphere. Overall, this move is a must see for everyone."
30.04.2023,9.0,"You really can't beat an original concept and Back to the Future gives us so many authentic ideas and visions in the one film. I love this movie it gives you such a rush of excitement of what it is like to time travel, the implications of doing so with the imagination of wonder, happiness, fear and love. The music is upbeat and suits each scene complimenting the characters and the journey. If you're after a futuristic adventure of a young man and his crazy scientist friend racing back in time to save the world then this is A great movie for you and the whole family to sit back and watch. Especially if your after a really cool 80""s vibe."
29.04.2023,10.0,"You know it can't be true, and yet, you go along with the story, because it's acted so well. You're dragged into philosphical questions like ""What if time travel were possible?"", ""Could you correct the past?"" and you see the contradictions happening, and still you believe it because everything seems logical.It's also a nostalgic flashback to the ""golden fifties"", and many people will recognize the ever returning generation conflicts. And it makes you think about the ""butterfly effect"" in your own life, the chain of little ""unavoidable?"" accidental events that brought you to your current situation in life, and how one small different reaction can change your whole life. I've seen it at least 20 times and I still enjoy it."
18.04.2023,10.0,"I just watched ""Back to the Future"" and I have to say, it exceeded all my expectations. The concept of time travel can be a tricky one to pull off, but this film does it with ease, taking us on a wild ride through the past and present.Michael J. Fox delivers a phenomenal performance as Marty McFly, capturing both the humor and heart of the character. Christopher Lloyd is equally impressive as Doc Brown, bringing a sense of eccentricity and charm to the role.The script is brilliantly written, with clever jokes and witty one-liners that had me laughing out loud. But what really makes this movie stand out is its ability to tackle serious themes such as the importance of family, and the consequences of our actions, while still keeping the audience entertained.The film's pacing is perfect, keeping me engaged from beginning to end, and the special effects still hold up surprisingly well for a movie that was made over three decades ago.Overall, ""Back to the Future"" is a true classic that deserves all the praise it has received over the years. It's a movie that will make you laugh, tug at your heartstrings, and leave you feeling inspired. I can't recommend it enough, and I'm already looking forward to watching it again."

As a time traveler myself, I must say that this movie hits all the right notes when it comes to adventure, humor, and heart.From the moment Marty McFly steps into the DeLorean time machine, the audience is taken on a wild ride through history. The attention to detail in the different time periods, from the 1950s to the 1980s, is simply amazing. And let's not forget the incredible soundtrack that perfectly captures the spirit of each era.But what really sets Back to the Future apart is its characters. Marty McFly and Doc Brown are two of the most iconic characters in cinema history, and for good reason. Their chemistry is electric, and their friendship is the heart of the movie. And who could forget the unforgettable performances by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd? They truly bring these characters to life in a way that is both hilarious and touching.And let's not forget about the themes of the movie. Back to the Future is not just a movie about time travel; it's a movie about the importance of family, the power of perseverance, and the idea that our futures are not predetermined. It's a movie that will leave you feeling inspired and uplifted.BTTF is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. It's a movie that I would recommend to anyone, whether you're a time traveler like myself or just someone looking for a great film. So, in the words of Doc Brown himself, ""Where we're going, we don't need roads!"""
01.04.2023,10.0,"When I was younger, I used to watch this movie everytime channel 9 would replay it, now I still do the same. I love it! While not the style of film I think I would make, I'm definitely glad it is around as it is the very film that sparked my interest in the film industry. Growing up I always wanted to be like Marty McFly and learning about the history of making this film, and how Micheal J Fox almost wasn't the actor, is super fascinating. The making of the movie was an absolute sh%t show and I'm surprised they finished it. Such an iconic and nostalgic film, I'll never give up the opportunity to watch it."
27.03.2023,10.0,"I'm a 44 y/o man and I still love this film. Me and my wife probably watch it half a dozen times a year (and the other two films!). I've watched it hundreds of times, I actually wish I knew exactly how many times I have watched it. I will never get bored of it though. It still makes smile when I watch it. It still makes my heart flutter when I hear the incredible score, or when Huey Lewis's The Power of Love kicks in.It hasn't aged a day either. So many films from the 80's have aged so poorly, not BTTF. It still looks like it was made today.I often wonder if we (BTTF Superfans) would still love it so much if Eric Stoltz had kept the part of Marty. I don't think I would've done. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd made it what it was.Thank you to everyone involved in making this film. It has kept me entertained for so many hours of my life, and it will do until the day I'm gone.10/10. The best film ever made."

23.03.2023,10.0,"Back to the future is a very charming and entertaining sci-fi adventure comedy, full of likeable characters and a great concept executed right. A nice time capsule of both the 80s and the 50s. It's a sweet story showing teens romancing in different eras and ways, and it uses it's idea of going back to the past and makes solid jokes. It might not be one of the funniest comedies of all time by any mean, but it's still really enjoyable. It's a perfect mixture of science fiction and comedy making a movie that's silly, yet clever at the same time. I'm sure everybody had seen it already, but if you somehow didn't, do yourself a favour."
19.03.2023,9.0,"I honestly don't understand why the first film of this iconic trilogy rarely comes up in film discussions. Many people use the 2nd and 3rd as pop culture references but rarely this one. Either way, it is still a great story! Michael J. Fox & the rest of the cast are fantastic! It's also probably one of the few 1980s films whose special effects are still great in the unfortunately-not-cool future that God punished us to live in. Oh well, at least we have flat-screen TVs and endless movie sequels! (But no overboards??? Do better, Humanity!) Lastly, I think the musical score and sense of humor this film has are really good."
03.03.2023,10.0,"One of my favourites! This is one of the most iconic and most thrilling films ever made in history of films!Its was so classic and bound to the era and it perfectly put together, with fantastic actors and a amazing storyline!The humor is perfect for the film ans very funny!It catches a unique era, at a moment people were thinking back on the 50s.Its tge most classical sci-fy film out there!Another thing that is great, is tge fabulous music which fits soo good into the story and the story development.This is really a must-see film for many reasons and i really recommend it. Its a masterpiece!!!"
27.02.2023,10.0,"Masterpiece of cinema, very original and great history. Always it's a good time to rewatch it.I highly recommend for people who likes to think about the space-time and the occasion we livin for. The story is dynamic and kept me with high expectations. Really had a great time watching it and no matter how old you are you will enjoy it. The musical content was magnificent, I always highlight the musical quality in the plays. I enjoy a good laugh and had a great time watching it and wouldn't mind watching it many times. With the title it gave me nostalgia, laughs and I was surprised by the amount of time I spent without seeing it until I was older, for this reason do not think about it anymore and watch it immediately. I said it before and I'll say it again: masterpiece."
23.02.2023,8.0,"""Back to the future"" is a mix of science fiction and comedy. The idea of time travelling is of course science fiction, but al the confusion that it provokes forms an ideal breeding ground for comedy. Given the fact that the time travelling machine is clearly recognizable as a car and the time travelling is into the past and not the future the comedy element is dominant.The story gives a brilliant example of the paradoxes time travelling can give rise to. A boy travels into the past and arrives at the time when his future parents get engaged. However his future mother obviously prefers him above his future father. The central mission of the film thus becomes that the boy has to force a match between his future parents in order to secure his own existence.Director Robert Zemeckis uses the comic potential of this situation to the max. Or should I say screenwriter Zemeckis, because the scenario is in my opinion the strongest element of the film. This easily compensates for the fact that with respect to some characters there is some overacting (the father is a little bit too goody-goody and the professor is a little bit too absentminded).Despite its character as a light weighted comedy ""Back to the future"" perfectly illustrates a philosophical problem with time travelling. When you travel to the past, you become an actor in this past. Because you become an actor in the past, you influences the past (The boy succeeds in matchmaking his future parents, but they do meet each other in a different way than without his interference). As you influence the past, you influence the future. So you can never return to the same future you came from!The film was made in the eighties and portrays the fifties. For spectators watching the movie at the time of release the fifties were the past and the eigthies their current time. Watching the movie in 2023 you are looking at two different pasts and also the ""current scenes"" in the movie look outdated. The first quarter reminded me very much of another typical eigthies movie as ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes).In some other reviews I read that ""Back to the future"" was a component of the optimistic Reagan era. I doubt it. Because the film is partly situated in 1955 and partly in 1985 you not only see the characters in these two different periods, but also the (fictional) city of Hill Valley. Some changes in Hill Valley are positive (a black waiter in 1955 has become the mayor of the city in 1985), but others are negative (a regular cinema in 1955 has become a porn cinema in 1985)."
14.02.2023,9.0,"""Back to the Future"" is a beloved classic that has stood the test of time, thanks to its expertly crafted storytelling, charming characters, and thrilling time-travel adventure. The film is widely praised for its clever screenplay, which expertly weaves together humour, romance, and science fiction to create a truly engaging and entertaining experience. Michael J. Fox's performance as Marty McFly is universally celebrated, and his chemistry with Christopher Lloyd's eccentric Doc Brown is one of the film's many highlights. The film's iconic soundtrack and stunning visual effects also contribute to its enduring popularity. Overall, ""Back to the Future"" is a must-see film that continues to captivate audiences of all ages, and its place as a cinematic classic is well-deserved."
13.02.2023,10.0,"Back to the Future is a timeless adventure that holds a special place in the heart of myself and many others. The film's mix of humor, action, and sci-fi created a unique and entertaining experience that still holds up today. The special effects, especially including the use of good old-fashioned practical effects, are still impressive and the soundtrack also plays an integral part of what I think makes the film so charming. The eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown, played by the brilliant Christopher Lloyd, is the standout character for me and really adds to the film's overall appeal, however Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is also great.In conclusion then, I would say Back to the Future is a must-see film for fans of sci-fi and action-adventure flicks, as well as anyone who loves a good time-travel story. The film's timeless appeal and memorable characters make it an absolute classic in my opinion which is why I've rated it a 9 out of 10."
08.02.2023,8.0,"Fond memories of this film. It was one of those films (back in the day) that actually had a begining, a middle and an ending . Probably because it wasn't written by a committee.One of those fabulous films (so rare these days) that not only has a story but is appealing to the entire family (without swearing, gratuitous violence or terrible CGI ) and then went on to make further sequels that were as goodWhat can I say. If you like time trave, feel good films with a happy ending - this is for you (and the sequels)You can watch this multiple times (i bought the box set) and can put this on for a nice sunday matinee film (remember them?)"
05.02.2023,10.0,"I love this movie. It's a classic. I enjoyed ALL the performances, but I really have to give props to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale - who wrote a script so spectacular, that it has stood the test of time and passed that test. The script had been rejected dozens of times, but the studios had no idea what they were missing out on - because it was a GENIUS script. I LOVE it. As we all know, this sci-fi classic, follows Marty McFly, who is thrown back into the '50s due to a time machine made by his elderly friend Doc Brown. The machine is made from a DeLorean. Marty meets his teenaged parents, and makes his mom fall in love with him, causing him and his siblings to begin disappearing - he must have his parents fall in love and return home."
03.02.2023,10.0,"Back to the future is the ultimate 1989's movie, if you're feeling nostalgic, or simply want to experience the flavour of the decade, then this is the movie for you.A young Michael J Fox is sent back to 1955 by his friend, Dr Emmett Brown, his very existence threatens his own future, he has to fight for life as he knows it.It's super fast paced, it's one of those movies that simply flies by, it's fully of action, full of laughs, it's very much the 80's poking fun at the 50's, the free and carefree lifestyle of 1985 showing how things have changed in three decades.Wonderful special effects, lots of pyrotechnics and action sequences to enjoy. The music is wonderful, you'll be singing along.The acting is superb, Michael J Fox is just great as Marty, Christopher Lloyd is awesome as the wild eyed Doc.I would say it's the perfect Boxing Day film, but it's one of those awesome movies that you'll enjoy any time, and with the whole family.A fabulous movie.10/10."
01.02.2023,7.0,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? And Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox."
01.02.2023,1.0,"This sci-fi would have been perfect if the tacky swearing didn't exist. I despise strong language in films, songs, and tv shows which is why I regularly don't watch them. Although, Back To The Future has an excellent plot and originality. I still think it could be more enjoyable without foul language in every scene! I have only seen it one and a half times in my life for those reasons. It be a lot more times for me if it didn't blurt obscene words in every scene. It's just too inappropriate. What's wrong with those writers anyway? I can tell they don't care about what they put in those scripts."
23.01.2023,6.0,"Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd give their best performances in this understated sci-fi comedy about travelling in time. The music by Alan Silvestri is stirring, and the special effects are not bad, considering the age of the film. The story is a bit hackneyed, but we forgive the plot because the characters are entertaining. The ridiculous situations cooked up by the writers work in some instances, and not in others; it is a bit uneven. Fox always had an infectious sense of humor on film, and it was a tragedy he had to retire prematurely from comedy. You may remember Lloyd from his role on the TV comedy Taxi, which also starred other major stars such as Danny Davito and Judd Hirsch."
06.01.2023,10.0,"The movie Back To The Future (1985) is one of my all-time favorites. The film never fails to bring a smile to your face whether you watch it for the 1st time or the 45th time. With humor for all ages and a kick-ass car to boot, what's not to love? Do you have a young heart?You'll laugh even though you know what's going to happen next with Marty's ""Johnny B Goode"" and Doc's ""Run For It Marty!"" The weed overcomes the bully, the dreams come true, all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a nickel ""Save The Clock Tower!""Even though it got decreasingly good in terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best in my repertoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.Featuring comedy, fantasy, Lea Thompson's stunning beauty, Doc's crazy but comical antics, and Marty's typical teenage antics, this movie gets a solid 9 out of 10."
04.01.2023,9.0,"Back to the Future is a delightful and timeless classic that continues to entertain audiences of all ages. The movie's clever script, engaging performances, and iconic imagery all come together to create a truly memorable and enjoyable film. The story follows Marty McFly, a likable and relatable protagonist, as he travels back in time and encounters his teenage parents in 1955. Alongside his eccentric inventor friend, Doc Brown, Marty must navigate the challenges of time travel and ensure that his younger self returns home safely. The movie is full of memorable moments, from the iconic DeLorean car to the humorous and heartwarming interactions between the characters. Whether you're watching it for the first time or revisiting it as an old favorite, Back to the Future is a movie that never fails to deliver. Highly recommended for fans of science fiction, comedy, or just great storytelling in general."
26.12.2022,10.0,"The first time I watched this movie was back in 2019. I saw it on Netflix and my dad told me how he remembered watching it in theaters back when it came out in '85 and said he loved it. This made me curious so I watched it. The whole movie just has a great story, great soundtrack, wonderful characters, is funny, and the special effects were pretty great for a 1980's movie. I can't remember the amount of times I've re-watched this movie since then, all I know more than 20 times. This movie is so memorable and made me fall in love with the BTTF trilogy. But this film, the first, will always be my favorite one. I really love Micheal J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's acting, they make the film so lively and enjoyable. Overall 10/10, I'll never get tired of this movie."
15.12.2022,8.0,"This is a movie that I realized I had never seen all the way through. I would come in after Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) was already in the past. Jaime and I decided to watch this since it was lighthearted and on the Internet Movie Database poster that we're working through as well. What I didn't realize until sitting down to view this was that Steven Spielberg produced, directed by Robert Zemeckis and Dean Cundey being the director of photography.For this, Marty lives with his parents Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover). He pals around with Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). It is through him that Marty ends up back to the day where his parents were supposed to meet. He gets in the middle by accident and disrupts that. He must set things right before returning to the present, even if he can return. Encountering Dr. Brown to help along with encountering Biff Tannen (Tom Wilson) and his group of cronies.What I will say is that this is better than I was expecting. I've heard people say this is their favorite movie. The writing is on point. There were little things that I noticed early on that come into play later. We also just get subtle things that if you aren't paying attention, you'll miss. I think that the acting is good as well, that helps. Fox is just on point and he is just Marty to me. His quirky nature fits so well. Lloyd is also great as Dr. Brown. He brings so much to his role as well. Other than that, Thompson, Glover, Wilson and the rest. The acting is good across the board.The rest of what I want to discuss would be with the filmmaking. I've already said how good the writing is. I think that this is shot well so credit there to the cinematography. Going along with that, the effects are 80s. I've seen worse though, I will say that. I'm a big fan of time travel movies even though there are plot holes that come with it. This is just a fun movie for what they do there. Other than that, I'd say the soundtrack fit for what was needed.My Rating: 8 out of 10."
12.12.2022,10.0,"""Back to the Future"" is simply a must watch classic. Peak 80s era blockbuster movie magic. It's funny, whimsical, and charming. I can't think of anyone who doesn't love this movie. The cast is all teaming with great chemistry, the writing is all superb. I love the fact that this movie has that ever-present layer of nostalgia surrounding it. Must have been nostalgic for people back in the 80s to see a ""present day"" person step back to the 50s, and it retains that nostalgia as a time capsule in the 80s moments.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are both great as the leading characters. Marty's parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) are great in supporting roles. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) is one of my favorite movie villains of all time. He gets more time to shine in ""Part II"", but here he's great as well.You owe it to yourself to watch it, and if you aren't grinning ear to ear by the time the credits roll, then you probably oughta ""make like a tree and get out of here."""
03.12.2022,10.0,"I have never expected that performance this so old movie but My mind is totally changed by the back to the future movie. It was absolute written by superior-high intelligence people besides there was more than just a scenerio. Actors played so incredible especcialy the doctor one. While i was watching i totally wondered about what did happen the next scene in the movie. The movie managed to hook me. Actually if lived in that times i would be crazy for this movie but if i say present time, we have been getting use to this future and past between them connection. For example we at met by avengers movies or something as like them. I don't want to keep long my essay. I just wanted to share my experience."
25.11.2022,8.0,"Here is a picture that makes audiences think and laugh, wonder and worry. Back to the Future is a uniquely 80s film entangled in the 1950s. Marty McFly and Doc are timeless characters that are supremely realized on screen by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Both of them are so animated and colorful with their deliveries throughout the runtime. The story is fresh and the writing is fun to the point that new viewers will be constantly asking themselves what's next. This is a film I can almost always sit down and enjoy, whether with family or even by myself. Despite its age, this movie continues to entertain."
27.10.2022,10.0,The story where a scientist breakthrough becomes an adventure and mission for a teenager. Accidentally landing in the year of Doc Browns first vision Marty finds himself in a different time.The story is very well written and the cast is cannon. The use of real science and action to keep you fueld will keep any film goer glued to this fun adventure. This film really stands the test of time and great for the family.The story doesn't warp you into an off set environment or become cartoony. It provides the right formula telling the story where it's going where it's been and where you are.A highly recommended film there's nothing negative about it.
24.10.2022,8.0,"One of the most successful films of its time perhaps it is. Blending time travel with comedy, it offers enjoyable moments to the audience. Acting Micheal J. Fox and Christoper Lloyd, this movie is a true masterpiece. No wonder it won so many awards, the acting and scripting are great.this movie contains a script and comedy ahead of its time. That's what makes it so Awesome! To summarize with slight spoilers; Back to the Future tells the story of a boy accidentally going from 1985 to 1955. Meeting his high school parents, the teenager accidentally attracts his mother's romantic interest. Since he prevented his parents from falling in love, he has to make up for his mistake and go back to 1985. If you haven't watched it yet, don't wait, open it and watch it now!"
10.10.2022,7.0,"This is a good movie about a boy who accidentally travels back in time and gives us a crazy story. This movie is rich in content, and we got to know a lot of different characters. I think the story was quite alright, and I appreciate when stories include time as a topic, which I think was well used in this one. Time travel is always interesting, and it rarely disappoints me. The story was kind of simple, but I think it was the interaction between the characters that made up for most of it. I think the actors were mostly good, but my attention goes to Crispin Glover (as George McFly). He played such a unique character, and his performance was great! This movie is definitely recommending!"
10.10.2022,9.0,"This movie is a timeless classic. You watch it anytime and you will enjoy it. Earlier I watched the movie in hindi dub and to be honest I didn't enjoy the movie that much. Today I watched the original english version and I totally enjoyed it. The story was enjoyable, the performances were also enjoyable and the ending was also left at cliffhanger which I thought was a smart move. Now, I am excited to watch the sequels which I haven't watched yet.Overall, it was a good movie which I would recommend to everyone. This movie can't be remade again and I respect the director when he said he will not allow anyone to make the remake."
05.10.2022,10.0,"This is one of the most perfect films ever. It's a masterpiece that has left its mark on pop culture - and for good reason. It's a classic-feeling film, with great acting, great shots and cinematography, and it's one of the best-plotted films ever. It's a film that doesn't have any major story flaws, almost all of the characters are memorable, and every actor gives their A-Game. So, on re-watch... It's a film I could never get tired of, and it's a great film on your 1sy watch, 10th, or 100th. It doesn't lose it's magic, and sometimes it's even better on re-watch... Noticing new details, knowing what had gone in behind the scenes, and seeing it in the film. It's a great film that's perfect to just throw on at any time, and it's always a great time to re-watch it!"
26.09.2022,10.0,"Everything about this film screams iconic. To the soundtrack to the wardrobe to the set design. The continuity itself is a cinephile's greatest discovery. How Robert Zemeckis did it, is phenomenal. Back to the Future sits high on my list as one of the best science-fiction romantic comedies of the 80s. It inspired me to become a director myself. Almost a decade after watching it, nothing else can compare.You won't be disappointed. Its heart-warming story will bring laughter and joy to your family movie night. Don't forget the popcorn and drinks because you will not want to pause it. I should warn you now, get the second and third movie. I spent one night watching the trilogy and I was highly impressed. I didn't get tired once. The plot twists kept me awake as I wanted to know what happened to Marty McFly, the main character.If you thought you had nothing in common with an 80s character, you'd be mistaken. McFly is just like you, and I. Everything goes wrong for him. But who's there to help him? His mentor and friend, Doc. We all have a Doc in our lives that we all know and love, and secretly worry for. A friend who lives on the edge. Every day is a new adventure for Marty and Doc. Whether it's scientific experiments to getting into trouble to traveling through time. Back to the Future is a movie you don't want to end. Because you're having too much fun.This movie makes you think. Not about girls, or boys. Nor romance or popularity. Back to the Future makes you think about family, friends, and the importance of our choices. To Marty, it's more important to be different than to fit in. He rather go against the status quo than to change himself to fit the past. In a world where people are bullied for being outsiders, this film teaches us to fight for our self-worth. Our value does not come from someone's opinion. It comes from within. Without self-love or self-value, there would be no you.The choices we make as individuals causes a chain reaction. What we do today has a direct impact on tomorrow, or the years to come. With actions there are consequences, and Back to the Future does a wonderful job in advising people to look closely at their actions and how it may affect them and those around them.This is not just a movie, I realized. It is a gift - from the past. A digital creation that offers advice and wisdom on how to live. As Marty McFly discovers adulthood, beside him we can learn from his mistakes and use his life lessons as our own. Whether it's through dating, going to school, being a son, being a friend, to being a hero. You will go to the past with Marty and Doc, and unlike our main character, you will never want to go back.So maybe you're just like Marty McFly - A slacker. An outcast. A rebel.Or you're just like Doc - An optimist. A creator. A visionary.If you're as lucky as I am, you're all the above.Great Scott, get in the DeLorean and buckle up. This ride was made for adults and children of all ages everywhere. What are you waiting for? Add it to your list of must watch. Huge thank you to Robert Zemeckis and the creators for changing my life. I know it will change yours!!!Similar Movies: Jurassic Park, Men in Black, Inception, E. T., Indiana Jones, Groundhog Day, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club."
25.09.2022,10.0,"This movie is an absolute classic and it still stands as my fave to this day... This time travelling masterpeice is great for the whole family and perfect for a movie night. This movie is followed by 2 others which are equally as good. If you love the 80's like I do, love a bit of action and drama then this movie is perfect for you. If you haven't already seen this movie, do yourself a favour. Micheal J Fox is the star in this movie and his acting is absolutely incredible. He has become one of my all time favourite actors because of this film. And just remeber lighting never strikes twice....."
22.09.2022,10.0,"I really loved this movie, one of my favorite ones of all time. I have seen it multiple times and probably will watch it again. I think it was a really funny movie and ahead of it's time. I have seen all of the sequals as well. As I was not born when it came out and as I am waching it in this century, I think it was really interesting to see what they thought the future would look like and what actually came true. I think that the whole idea about the movie was genius and made you think abouy your live and how would it be if just few small things changed, so you have to be gratefull for what you have."
11.09.2022,10.0,"Time travel is the most illogical and, at the same time, a truly inexhaustible and incredibly fascinating topic, a bottomless barrel of plots for fantastic cinema. ""Back to the Future"" is one of the best science fiction films in the history of cinema, shot on this topic, a real cult of the genre.However, it is almost impossible to determine the genre of this picture. This is, perhaps, the standard of how to make a film, the plot of which is based on so many genres: comedy, fantasy, drama, adventure, and even a thriller! The element of each genre is carefully calibrated here and fits very harmoniously into the overall style of the picture.""Back to the Future"" is a film that is subtle, smart, deep, incredibly thoughtful and, at the same time, very light, bright and stylish. Only Zemeckis could show, in such an easy and elegant form, essentially very serious things: the lack of mutual understanding between parents and children, problems in the family, the formation of character and the desire to change one's life for the better and make a decisive choice - to be weak all the time, no matter what. Not capable, a whiner and break down under the blows of fate or proudly stand up to his full height, overcome fear in himself, overcome himself and give back to his offender. ""Your future is not written anywhere - it is what you make it!"" - the key thought that runs like a rod through the whole trilogy.A wonderful plot, a magnificent script thought out to the smallest detail, absolutely deservedly nominated for an Oscar, excellent directing and very high-quality technical performance complete the picture. Cinematography, editing, sound, visual effects - everything is done superbly. And, of course, it should be noted the legendary and recognizable from the first notes of the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, which fits perfectly into the visuals of the picture and the brilliant acting.Michael J. Fox is the perfect Marty. Nimble, charming, resourceful, cheerful guy with a sparkle in his eyes and a great sense of humor, always able to stand up for himself, despite his small stature and Doc Brown performed by Christopher Lloyd is no less charming professor, very humorous, a little silly and eccentric. Together they form an incredibly funny and touching tandem and cause real delight.The rest of the actors are not far behind - they all played wonderfully, very organically fitting into the plot. There is not a single ""sagging"" frame and not a single superfluous character in the film - each character, even the most insignificant, is verified and thought out to the smallest detail. By the way, it's funny that in the trilogy the then very young Billy Zane, Casey Semashko and the very young Edijah Wood ""lit up"".""Back to the Future"" is a film for all times, for any age and any audience. It will never lose its relevance and magical, magical appeal. This is a journey into childhood, to breathtaking adventures and journeys that so excite the imagination. This film can be reviewed an infinite number of times - and each time you experience indescribable delight, experiencing adventures with the heroes of the picture. This film will make a great addition to any collection. A timeless masterpiece. Classic."

Or I'm not not liking it, or a combo, but for whatever reason, I'm always ready to turn it off. In that last 20 minutes give or take.Other than that, and overall I love the movie. 8.5 Gigawatts for me.WTH is a Gigawatt?!"
19.08.2022,10.0,"Back to the Future stays a true classic and holds up so well 37 years later. Fox is just incredible in the role. The story is solid and the whole execution almost flawless. And of course you have the music, the cinematography and all the other technical elements very well executed."

10.08.2022,1.0,"This is a fraud movie, the most effective one I know of; everyone in the '80s liked it. Spielberg said the ""studios weren't ready for Bob's movies, even though he was ready to make them"" or something (it's on Zemeckis's Wikipedia page), but really, I think this was a question of the Spielbergian élan that he can't confer to others but imagines (might be) there ... of all the follow-ups and rip-offs to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' the Lucas Star Wars films, 'E. T.,' 'Close Encounters,' and 'Jaws', it's this one that sticks ... not ""Young Sherlock Holmes,"" ""Tales of the Gold Monkey,"" ""King Solomon's Mines,"" ""Battle Beyond the Stars,"" or Spielberg's own ""Amazing Stories"" and ""Twilight Zone"" revivals (I'm omitting ""Gremlins,"" but Joe Dante has a vision and style of his own, so bear with me). Zemeckis, later to give us ""Forrest Gump"" and having already given us ""Used Cars"" (not a hit, but considered a cult classic, and subversive) and ""Romancing the Stone"" (funnily enough, one of the biggest hits of the year and everyone was fond of it at the time, though it sticks in no-one's craw *now*; Kathleen Turner had trouble finding movie roles after 'Body Heat,' no-one wanted a husky-voiced Bacall like they wanted a sarcastic Jack Nicholson in Christian Slater, makes have it easier!), once said ""he never saw why people disparaged TV so much ... I learned a *lot* from TV!"" or something. (Which is where we get ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" which holds up badly now -- or at least weakly, like water dripping through a sieve. It's not just who cares about these characters now -- or, not to be unkind, but Bob Hoskins either, but let's get real -- but who cares about these *pretenses* now? WB cartoons may come up in ""The Shining"" but that's about it. I used to watch Saturday morning cartoons every week until I grew out of them, but I'm as little fond of them even as a memory as I am of sugar-coated breakfast cereals, which was supposed to make up for eggs and bacon, much less the breakfast scrambled everyone eats in Portland, where I live, now. I used to be Boba Fett and Yoda for Halloween, get me? Who *cares* about Saturday Morning Cartoons -- at least I *remember* those costumes, those experiences, etc.) Which -- the TV-watching I mean -- makes him like David Mamet. ""I grew up during the golden age of television!"" he says, or something close to it (I'm quoting from memory), in his relatively-recent book about realizing he's a ""conservative."" And David Mamet was considered one of the pre-eminent playwrights of our time, certainly when I was in college in the early '90s and Madonna's choosing to do ""Speed the Plow"" on Broadway was supposed to be significant and ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" was being made into an all-male, ""Reservoir Dogs""-like allstar combatant zone by the Jim Thompson adapter, ""After Dark, My Sweet's"" James Foley (still the only Mamet, aside from ""House of Games,"" worth seeing, and at that, only once -- who cares about ""Heist?"" He's too full of himself). Talk about high and low culture! All of a sudden it looks like we're being duped, because we're too shy to construct our own narratives, and can't tell people confident enough to string scenes together with sugary-coated TV motives and direct them into life from ""Love's Labor Lost."" I say phooey on this movie. All it teaches is contempt -- and you can tell this from the reviews on here, they're all replete with it. Crispin Glover was much better (and *memorable*!) in ""Wild at Heart"" (""I'm making my lunch!""). Who could forget *that*?"
10.08.2022,8.0,It was a good movie with interesting plot. There was a few plot holes that is normal in this type of time travel movies so it's okey. The characters are fun and it reminded us Rick And Morty.
27.07.2022,10.0,"Every damn time.Every single goddamn time I watch this film I want to skateboard, and I want to be able to play guitar much better than I can, and I want to beat up the school bully...basically I just wanted to be Marty McFly.And I have done ever since I was 11 when I first watched this, because he really is just the perfect protagonist. He has a relatable struggle with wanting to be successful, his story has high stakes, he's extremely likable and funny...just about the only thing you could complain about is the often recognised fact that he doesn't really have an arc of any sort.But (at least for me) it's really not needed because of everything he does mentioned above, plus the fact that no one could have played him any better than Michael J. Fox, who delivers what is honestly one of my favourite performances ever in this film, and the fact that he very nearly couldn't be part of the film at all is terrifying. There's some other universe that has Eric Stoltz as Marty instead, and no hate to Eric, but that's not a universe I want to live in.But for as much as I could bang on about Michael J. Fox in this, all the other major actors are just as fantastic. Every single one of them played one of the best examples of their respective archetype in cinema: Christopher Lloyd gave us one of the most memorable and funniest mad scientists ever, Crispin Glover must have forever damaged his social standing by playing one of the biggest dorks ever captured on film to perfection, Lea Thompson never fails to convince you that she is an utterly infatuated girl (and an alcoholic at the beginning), and Thomas F. Wilson as Biff is my single favourite bully in cinematic history. What an ass.Coming back to this after it had been a few years since I last saw it, however, it really struck me just how funny this film is. I remembered there being a few jokes, sure, but this really is a straight-up comedy, and everyone of the aforementioned actors aside from Michael J. Fox is hamming it up massively. But it works because Marty is the everyman thrown into a wacky situation unimaginable to anyone watching, so every other character being so over the top works perfectly for the tone.None of them could have been so funny without a great script though, and as far as I'm concerned this film has one of the best ever written. There's brilliant foreshadowing, set ups and payoffs, the plot is imaginative, it's paced flawlessly, and the dialogue is absolutely gorgeous. Trust me, another thing I do everytime I watch this is I end up quoting it for weeks afterward.This has also got to be Robert Zemeckis' best directing by far - so many memorable images, the production design is great, especially with how good it is at making you believe you're looking at a 50's version of a town, and there isn't a single editing flub.And good lord that main theme. Need I say more?You can argue that there's a few minor plot holes here and there, and admittedly in some ways it is a little problematic today, but none of that really bugs me because of just how damn good this screenplay is overall, and I really couldn't think of anything else to moan about.So yeah, Back To The Future was in some ways already a classic in 1985, it was a classic in 2015, it'll undoubtedly still be a classic in 2045 and beyond, and if you haven't seen it...get on that. You've only got so much time."
18.07.2022,9.0,"""Wait a minute. Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?""If you got anything that has to do with time, space, paradox hypotheses; well, just count me in. My fascination with these subjects knows no bounds yet regrettably I have never taken the time to experience one of the most touted classics ever proposed on time travel. Believe it or not, this was my first ever viewing and I was thoroughly entertained!Even if there are not many dialogues going on about the core concept; I still happened to enjoy my time with the film, probably more than I anticipated. It was not a laughter ride nor did it wish to become exceptionally passionate about the topic at hand; it just wanted to serve you a delightful plate full of entertainment and light-hearted fun and I think it was successful in doing that. I had a big smile on my face for the totality of this film!"
14.07.2022,9.0,"Robert Zemeckis' film ""Back to the Future"" marks the beginning of an amazing story of two friends: a little mad scientist and a young guy who comprehend the science of time travel and find themselves involved in the most interesting adventures. Once this movie made a splash, winning an Oscar. To this day, this movie becomes an excellent companion for the whole family when watching together.Having seen the film for the first time at a young age, you involuntarily begin to take an example from the young Marty McFly. By the way, he is played by a talented actor Michael J. Fox. The hero is ambiguous. He is absolutely positive, but bold, ready to help a friend, stand up for his ideas. In addition, you need to have an excellent nervous system, being in a different time among those people you almost don't know. Michael's character copes with this perfectly, simultaneously forcing the audience to smile and empathize. Fox was very pleased with the work.Dr. Brown initially appears to the audience as a dorky scientist who is not completely connected with science, but later you realize that the world around you simply does not know what he knows. Christopher Lloyd, in my opinion, makes half of this film, although he seems to have a second role in the movie. He is purposeful, assertive and hungry for new discoveries in science.And this couple is working smartly in a duet, trying to correct their own mistake. Thompson, Glover and Wilson are also charismatic. Their heroes perfectly convey the era of the 50s, a kind of youth who has already forgotten the war, has grown up and is preparing to step into adulthood.The film has a wonderful soundtrack that makes you feel the era, the atmosphere, literally visit in 1955, understand how wild it looked for a teenager from 1985.Viewers will appreciate a variety of references to popular culture, especially Darth Vader of the 1955 model is remembered. The movie is wonderful. It is suitable for any age, will make you laugh and empathize, discuss actions. Isn't this the true goal of cinema?9 out of 10."

And this film give us a dream it's would be like to do so. Great ever classic film I I keep coming back and watch again and again, I lost count of how many time I had watch it."
24.06.2022,10.0,It's a total masterpiece. Best time travel movie ever made. Great si-fi and comedy package it was. I really enjoy the every part of this movie. Loved it very very very much.
24.06.2022,9.0,"Can anything that hasn't been said yet be said about this movie? I'm at the start of watching this trilogy which I have never actually sat down to watch until now. Only having seeing memes, references and some famous clips.This is just a perfectly executed movie really, great characters, attentive viewers are rewarded with future in movie references constantly. Character arcs are solid. It's checked all the boxes. But goes beyond that.Directing is fantastic, Zemeckis and Spielberg showing their best. From the long take intro that rhymes with the movie and tells everything we need to know about Doc, to the euphoric moments of time travel.It's hard to judge music as of now as it has become so iconic for the trilogy, it's really good. Sound design too for the car but I can't unhear the sound of a X-Wing unfolding when the car jumps, that has to be the same right?!Anyways, it's such a satisfying story. But the time travel aspect makes it really hard to look much deeper than surface level. You simply cannot think about the butterfly effect here because the movie doesn't either. Also the final scene still wrecks my brain, isn't that second Marty going to repeat what the first Marty did? And so end up in a infinite loop or something? But I know this is not the type of movie that dives into something like that.Curious to see the next two in the trilogy, the ending here was hilarious. LLoyd gives a incredible performance. Coincidentally I just discovered he played Judge Doom in Who Framed Roger Rabbit and you wouldn't have guessed those were the same two people. J. Fox does great too with that quirky-ness that makes him so enjoyable to watch...but what's up with that sleeping pose!? He looks like he's broken his arms, it was funny, but also so weird. Also I loved Glover in this, saw him for the first time in a F13 movie with his crazy dance act, here he plays a similar wacky character and owns it.Looking forward the the next two."
23.06.2022,10.0,"Great film! If you've ever wondered what the future would be like as a kid, this film does a great job at foreseeing what the future might be like. That being said, it's a film that one would love to still continue watching even today because the future in the movie is nothing like what we expect in reality. Nonetheless, it's a fun film with lying vehicles, cool inventions and so much more. It's highly recommended."
20.06.2022,10.0,"I wish they still made movies like this . It had what most movies lack today. DRIVE ! 🚗 . When rewatching this movie at an older age you feel that rustic , American free will society.Ronald Ragan."
18.06.2022,10.0,I am a big fan of the original Back to the Future movie because it's a real classic. The acting is great and the storyline is amazing. The DeLorean is Beautiful and the idea behind it is great. It's nicely filmed and the script is good too. I can only recommend this movie - and the two BTTFs after it!
07.06.2022,10.0,"Iconic. A classic. Seriously, there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said. One of the greatest films of all time and one of my favorite films of all time. I don't like calling movies perfect, because there's always something, but man... this movie's perfect."
25.05.2022,8.0,I watched the movie in the night and i didn't sleep. The movie have weak script but the director did a good job for movie be good and humorous.Congratulations to all involved.
20.05.2022,10.0,"I loved watching this movie I found it very entertaining and it was also extremely funny. I hope I get to watch it on my TV again. :D Best movie I've ever seen. The actors did good acting in it. It reminds me of Rick and Morty. Great scenes as well, my friends also loves this too."
19.05.2022,10.0,I remember this set for back to the future. I also used the set for some music videos. The hoverboard was soo cool too test out as a prop before the actual film.
16.05.2022,9.0,"Some movies manage to capture a generation of audiences, to the point that, it garners much love from new audiences, throughout the decades, since its initial release in theaters. It appeals to younger people, as well as, the older crowd too. It becomes part of the pop culture landscape. These films work like a tradition to many. The list is ever-growing. It consists of titles, like the Wizard of Oz (1939), Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) and this film, Back to the Future (1985). These are films, that survive the changing of times. They are ageless. That's because they appeal to a large group of different sectors of the audiences. Most everyone can quote a line, recognize an image in the film or they have some kind of a connecting memory to the film, like a date or something. Director, Robert Zemeckis strikes gold with this one. It also is interesting and funny to note, how much of an impact Back to the Future (1985), has had on the debate about time travel. A pop-culture influence, that was energized 34 years later in Avengers: End Game (2019).As everyone knows, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), finds himself sent back in time to 1955, by his scientist buddy, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Marty enlists the aid of Doc's 1955 self to aid him in returning to the future. A hilarious, smart, adventure, fantasy film unfolds from there. Fox and Lloyd were born to be Marty and Doc. The supporting cast does an excellent job also. The trick in this film, that helps with the suspense, is the plot idea, that Marty must not do anything, that will effect the future. Of course, that is an impossible task, that makes this adventure, one of the most cherished films ever.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."
15.04.2022,10.0,"Back to the future is a great movie and in my opinion the best comedy movie of all time.The acting is great, Michael J. Fox was the perfect actor to be Marty Mcfly. He makes the character feel so real and funny.The characters are great, literally no character is bad and if your looking for the best character in movie you have it in this movie, i'm talking about Marty Mcfly the comedy the character brings is great, i love his arrogance. The plot is perfect. The cinematography is also great.They used the budget in the best way possible.Doc is one of the funniest characters of all time.This movie is referenced so many movies and Tv shows.It's a perfect movie for the whole family and i recommend it in so many ways!"
15.04.2022,10.0,"It's definitely the best one out of the trilogy. It's fun seeing how actions made in the past have a small effect on the present. For example at the very beginning of the movie you can see a sign of a mall i guess that's named ""Twin pines"", but when Marty goes back in time for the first time he destroys one of them and at the end in the present the mall is named ""Alone Pine"" and there is more, MORE of such easter eggs. The music is one of those that when you hear it you can immediately know that it's from this trillogy. If you haven't seen it already then go, watch right now. Where did you live for last 35 years if you haven't seen it? It's one of the best movies i have ever seen, 10/10."
11.04.2022,10.0,"It is a adventure film.This film is set in the year 1985 in Hill Valley California
It´s about Marty McFly and Doc, a scientist.Marty McFly, a school student gets lost in 1955 by an accident, 30 years back in a time. With the help of his friend, Doc a scientist, he is desperately trying to find his way back to the future in the year 1985.I would recommend this film Because is very funny, exciting, unbelievable, cool, interesting, captivating, amazing, exceptional, great, awesome, extraordinary, magnificent, surprising, nice, astonishing, amaze, fascinating, enjoyable, agreeable, beautiful, different from other movies, fine, excellent, exceptional, marvellous, outstanding, adventurous, curious one thousand adjectives more."
08.04.2022,8.0,"When people talk about classic scifi films, they always mention Star Wars and Back to the future! This review will be about the latter. Back in the early 80s, Robert Zemeicks was developing this film for many studios, but most of them rejected due to being childish, so when he tried to give the idea to Walt Disney studios, they weren't satisfied with the fact that Lorraine was flirting with her son from the future without even knowing. And finally, after 50 attempts at pitching the idea to every single company, Universal finally accepted and made his wish come true. And even 4 decades since it's release, people still love the movie for it's creativity and special effects. But how exactly is this movie special?The plot begins with a teenage boy Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) being a rebel who likes skateboarding, playing the guitar and being friends with a crazy scientist Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd). The doctor invents a time machine out of a delorean car and tests it out. But due to some unfortunate events, Marty finds himself in the 50s and meets his parents in their high school years. Now our protagonist has one goal in mind - to make sure that George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson) stay together as a couple and to avoid Biff (Thomas F Willson). Otherwise, he would have a big risk of being vanished. The story is well done, it's truly amazing! The whole idea of meeting your parents when they were around the same age as you definitely sounds fun, and the movie took the full advantage of it. As you may notice, neither George nor Lorraine know Marty, so they just think that he's just a student from the other state. And most characters are shocked when they hear that he's different. For example, when Lorraine's parents hear that Marty has more than 1 tv in the house and that he already saw the episode of the show. There is a lot of funny scenes in the film too. I especially laughed when Marty tried to wake up George by dressing up himself as Darth Vader and telling him that he's an alien from the planet Vulcan. I can say that the action scenes were well done as well. Like the one where our hero McFly punched Biff in the face and later on, took the box and turned it into a skateboard.Let's move on to the characters. Marty may seem like your typical high school student who doesn't take school seriously and likes to hang out and play music, but once he travels to the past, he started to be more responsible for his actions by making sure Lorraine and George fall in love with each other. He's a great protagonist with a well executed character development. Another important character is Doctor Brown, a scientist who came up with a time travel car after accidentally hitting a head by a sink, thus creating a flux capacitor. His past self tries his best to bring back our hero back to the future (hence the title), which shows us that he cares about his soon to be friends person. Biff may seem to be the typical bully who likes to make fun of others, George McFly to be more specific. But when you realize that even the smallest thing can change the future (that idea was also explored in Butterfly effect), his role increases down to the point where he can be hateable, but still nicely made as an antagonist! Finally, George and Lorraine are 2 classmates who don't even know about each other that much. The female character actually fell in love with Marty instead of George because the former was the one who nearly got hit by a car. As for the male character, he seems to be confused about everything of what's going on, especially with Marty's goals. But you still support and root for him thanks to his future son. And thanks to the performances of J Fox, Lloyd, Glover, Thompson and Wilson, these characters became interesting and enjoyable in the best way possible, and you just can't imagine someone else portraying them.Finally, we have the soundtrack and effects. The music here is energetic and fun. Especially the Johnny B good song, which was a typical 80s rock song that played during the underwater themed prom party, but it was a great song that was catchy for both old and new generations! The effects may seem dated, but they are not distracting nor cheap, and look fitting for something that came during that time. But back then, they were amazing and stood out from other movies of the similar genre.This movie needs to be seen by everyone, regardless of age or generation. Even with some outdated effects, it stood the test of time and became one of the best examples of not just scifi, but movies in general. I highly recommend this to those who enjoyed the Soviet movie Guests from the future or the 2000s film Butterfly effect. Trust me, it's worth your time!""I Guess You Guys Aren't Ready For That Yet. But Your Kids Are Gonna Love It."" - Marty McFly."
04.04.2022,10.0,This movie is something you wanted to see again and again and you will never be bored. Evert scene detailing it is very rare you could found a flaw. Its 100% recommended from my side.
03.04.2022,10.0,"I dont have any words, this is just a masterpiece of cinema, when i see this movie for the first time i love it and every time i see it is even better and better and better...."
02.04.2022,10.0,"For me, no other film captures the spirit of the 80s as well as 'Back to the Future': the coolness, the fun, the music - if you want to re-live the experience (or feel it for the first time, if you have the misfortune of having been born too late), watch Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) going back to 1955. Robert Zemeckis has created a film that is as close to perfect as anything could possibly be. I won't go into the details of acting, plot, photography etc. 'Back to the Future' is irresistable, and that's it."
30.03.2022,8.0,"In fact, I saw the film for the first time properly a few days ago, which is a shame, because I actually like such old movies very much and the film is simply cult! He has a very classic humor and films in which the mother falls in love with her son would probably no longer exist today. Rightly so, because it provided the one or other cringe moment.Due to the cult status I had very high expectations of the film, which unfortunately were not quite met, but I was not completely disappointed either. The film has wit and you fever with Marty, who tries to bring everything back in order. Like many films from these years, it has a very pleasant mood and you could fully immerse yourself in the story. Even though some elements were very predictable, you were surprised in some places. I must say that I liked the first part best. The second was also still okay, but the third would not have been necessary in my opinion.Clear recommendation to all who have not yet seen the film, because it is simply a must-watch!"
25.03.2022,9.0,"A solid movie that still holds up after more than 30 years, must be the timeless themes of Family, Love and Density I mean Destiny. Not bad for a movie that was apparently rejected over 40 times. Not raunchy enough to be a 'Risky Business', too risky for business at Disney. Persistence pays off, it's like I always say ""If you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything""."
21.03.2022,9.0,"Esse file é ARTE. Muito bom e legal. O Marty é muito top e o doc também é muito show.recomendo demais esse filme,de volta para o futuro. Também tem o dois que é muito melhor que esse e o três que tá pau a pau com esse aqui."
16.03.2022,10.0,This is good in so many ways I don't know how to put it in words but I'll try. The characters are perfect and same with the storyline. Biff tannen is a idiot and looks like one (WITCH IS PERFECT) I just love the storyline and the time machine (OBVIOUSLY !!) The end. Also Marty McFly is the best name ever . THE ACTUAL END NOW.
13.03.2022,10.0,"This movie never gets old. Everything about this movie is just perfect. Awesome. 😀😀
What a movie !!!!I was not even born when this movie was released. But I still remember the excitement I felt when I watched it in the 90's. I still get the same excitement when I watch it now."
28.02.2022,10.0,"It's a classic for a reason, this film genuinely never gets old. It is absolutely phenomenal, from an amazing score, to awesome characters, this film truly has it all. There will always be a special place in my heart for doc."
27.02.2022,10.0,"Such a good film that was a cultural reset for time travel movies. The aesthetic is so unique and has inspired so many other films, in addition to being a pop culture item (think about how many parties and events are themed after B2TF!) Would highly recommend."
23.02.2022,10.0,"I was somewhat disappointed by the explicit sexuality, but seeing Michael J Fox wiggle his little legs on stage totally made up for it! I haven't seen the sequel yet but I hope that they make Biff less sexy in it, his raw sexual energy was just too much to bear."
13.02.2022,10.0,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, my brother recommended it to me.My brother recommended this film to me because for him it was framed by childhood, since the film is from his time.The environment that is used in this film, that context of the 85s and how they think the future is incredible."
13.02.2022,10.0,"Being 80's kid, I grew up watching this movie and I can so relate it to the future and what can I say I still watch it with my kids. Guess what!!! I watch it like a child as if I am watching it for the first time.I never get tired watching it over again."
07.02.2022,10.0,"My family and I have watched this film so many times I've lost count. I think my husband basically has it memorized! It's a great family movie that seems to never age. It's clever, funny, suspenseful, futuristic, and just an all-around great movie.Hopefully everyone has seen it. If you haven't, it's highly recommended!"
06.02.2022,10.0,"The stars aligned for Robert Zemeckis in 1985. Stoltz out and Fox in was the first sliding door that ensured this masterpiece has endured. Lloyd is perfect as Doc, and Wilson's Biff is one of the great villains that mixes gormlessness with genuine menace. Glover nearly steals the film, and his absence in the two sequels is sorely missed upon rewatching the original. But this is Fox's film. He is so effortlessly charming and funny (and convincingly tough for a man of his stature) that he dominates every scene among hugely talented character actors. Make no mistake, this guy was a superstar and BTTF launched his career 10/10."
04.02.2022,9.0,"Genius made into a movie in all its senses, to be classic so to speak, it does not require very real special effects because it does not, a spectacular script, memorable characters, well-shot sets, a story never seen back then, and a trilogy that will will leave you waiting more and more.I recommend it yes or yes, it is one of those works that we will never see again."
03.02.2022,8.0,"Rlly great movie to watch with the family, popcorn and hot chocolate. Nice time, pretty funny, though by no means is it especially intellectual or thought provoking."
03.02.2022,10.0,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? And Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways."
01.02.2022,10.0,The first time I saw this movie I was 14 years old. And watched it outside in the window of a video store. I accidentally started the look and was hooked till the end. Even when it started to rain I needed to see the end of this movie. This movie has took me by surprise and never let go. What an all-time classic.
31.01.2022,10.0,"Back to the Future's success and creation of this generation's love and praise for this movie is one that was attained through its untouchable writing, incredible directing, and astonishing cast. The funny, adventurous time-traveling story is one that has been showered with popularity due to writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale's incredible storytelling. Their capability to show a new and improved concept when dealing with the popular time-traveling genre and making it memorable and exciting is what attains the sci-fi fanatic's attention. Zemeckis directing truly shines in Back to the Future; his camera work allows the movie to be an intriguing and entertaining film for the younger audience, contrasting the use of fast-paced action sequences and calm, smooth romantic sequences and with it, latch the audience further with the storyline, characters, and memorable scenes to create an unforgettable first impression. The cast's ability to portray believable characters that'll make the audience love and connect with them is exactly what Back to the Future achieves. Michael J. Fox's interpretation of Marty's charm and juvenility and Christopher Lloyd's portrayal of Doc Brown's funny, comedic, and science freak self fulfill the audience's desire for a relatable, comedy movie that has scientific fiction sprinkled all around it. Many ingredients go into the creation of good filmmaking, but the Back to the Future film truly goes up and beyond in its decision of screenwriting, directing, and cast. Sci-fi, comedy, and time-traveling fanatics would undoubtedly leave a place in their hearts for this film as it checks off every box in their genre of amazing filmmaking."
31.01.2022,10.0,Amazing movie. I am watching and enjoying all 3 parts all of them. Have torrent subject but looks like one movie. They don't make move as like this quality Anymore.
19.01.2022,8.0,"It seems to me, ""Back to the Future"" - the best trilogy in the entire history of television. It always happens that the first film is much more interesting than the rest, and they only spoil the impression of history. Here is the opposite. For example, I don't know which one of the three films I like.And success depends not even from actors, but from the screenwriter, the regentiness and producer. In these films there are everything: and stunning special effects, and super-actors, and an excellent script. And their success was not not for anyone a surprise: all the rewards they won - there is for what. I looked at this films an incredible number of times, but, of course, I'll see again as soon as the time appears."
19.01.2022,10.0,"In honor of the 35th anniversary of the film's release, the viewer can again enjoy the classic masterpiece of science fiction in December of the year of 2020, which is extremely memorable in terms of the number of restrictions and bans.And it seems that the picture is not only not outdated, but also uniquely relevant in modern times. Perfectly balanced plot, amazing combination of comedy and science, amazing homage to the old days and an immense desire to know the future.It's amazing how Zemeckis and Gale brilliantly crafted the story with a vision for a future sequel, brilliantly incorporating pop culture Easter eggs from the 50s and 80s. Stunning characters are embodied on the screen by perfectly matched actors. Fox and Lloyd thus generally acquired the status of icons, becoming objects of fan dreams for years to come.And with tears of joy in your eyes, you are again watching a familiar story, only now you have a big screen in front of you, allowing you to feel, as if for the first time, all the versatility of the cult masterpiece!"
19.01.2022,10.0,"This is, without a doubt, the greatest movie I have ever seen. Nothing can top how perfect this is. The actors all do a fantastic job, the comedic moments are incredibly funny, and the story and script are two things that will forever be memorable. This is a movie that just wouldn't hit the same if it was remade today. Everybody should see the film and learn a valuable lesson from it, as we should all remember that time is what we make of it."
19.01.2022,9.0,"This picture is perfect for family viewing, there are elements of the trailer, and family drama, and adventure. And when all these ingredients start to spin around time travel, then the science genre appears."
19.01.2022,10.0,"If I want something adventurous and fantastic, then I watch this movie. This is the first time travel movie I've watched.The film is set in 1985 and 1955. That is, there are two storylines in it. Oh, three, to be exact, since there is also a plot line ""back to 1985"".Starring teenager Marty, played by Michael J. Fox, he is friends with an eccentric scientist, played by Christopher Lloyd. The main actors played their roles perfectly. As a child, I loved watching the scientist, whom Marty called just Doc.I've always found this movie very interesting. It looks in one breath.The film earned the Hugo Award, Saturn, Oscar... therefore, I cannot give a low rating. And I wouldn't have. The film of my childhood. Very interesting.I recommend it for viewing!Thanks for your attention!"
19.01.2022,10.0,"Good day, dear friends!As for me, the first part of the trilogy about time travel is the coolest. Why? Firstly, she is the most sincere of all three. Secondly, there is very cool music, both in the background and in reality.Michael J. Fox is still so young here, such a sweetheart, when I watched this film as a child, I simply did not forget not to fall in love with his antics, smile and how he plays the guitar.Since then, the theme of time travel is probably my favorite.You review and understand that the quality of the picture is simply amazing. After so many years, it doesn't look that good. Simple and funny dialogues, an understandable plot without subsidence and any holes. We understand the motivation of each of the characters in the film.I give ten out of ten. I can watch it every year and enjoy.Thank you for your attention! Happy viewing!"
19.01.2022,9.0,"Time travel is the most illogical and, at the same time, truly inexhaustible and incredibly fascinating topic, a bottomless barrel of plots for fantastic cinema. ""Back to the Future"" is one of the best science fiction films in the history of cinema, shot on this subject, a real cult of the genre.However, it is practically impossible to determine the genre affiliation of this picture. This is, perhaps, the standard of how to make a film, the plot of which is based on so many genres: this is comedy, science fiction, drama, adventure, and even a thriller! The element of each genre here is carefully verified and fits very harmoniously into the overall style of the picture."
12.01.2022,10.0,"I have watched this movie thousand times. It is s amazing, and it is definitely worth watching. The interesting thing about the movie is that so many incidents are coming to true."
05.01.2022,10.0,"From the perfectly casted actors, Alan Silvestri's score and the time machine designed out of a Delorean.This movie is perfect and timeless, many different generations will embrace it.Even the poster is a classic!!"
30.12.2021,10.0,"This movie takes me back to my childhood. I remember seeing this in the movie theater and being so excited about the ""future"" now im in the future and i wish things were siple as back then."
29.12.2021,9.0,"What's not to love about this film? It's just such a joy from start to finish. One of those 80s films like 'The Goonies', 'E. T', 'Ghostbusters' etc that is so full of adventure, excitement, wonder, and can be enjoyed by all ages.This film has been reviewed to death by this point so there's nothing I can say that will be very original.The plot is fantastic, so fun and well paced, with great humour and emotional beats. It has an all time classic soundtrack. Incredibly fun and engaging performances from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd.Back to the Future is a classic. Almost everything about it is iconic and it really is a class and joyous piece of cinema."
25.12.2021,10.0,"Eccentric scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents a time machine and by accident his friend Marty (Michael J Fox) goes back in time to a point where his parents first met and he messes things up risking his own existence. He seeks out a younger Doc Brown to help him get back to the future.One of a few completely perfect stories, brilliantly brought to the screen by Robert Zemeckis and acted by the wonderful double act of Fox and Lloyd. The consequences of playing with time are cleverly demonstrated leading to a wonderful and exciting climax. The support cast are excellent including the decidedly odd Crispin Glover. Superb."
24.12.2021,10.0,"This should go down as one of the greatest movies of all time. Practically flawless in every way, enjoyable from beginning to end, Back To The Future is in my opinion a masterpiece."
19.12.2021,10.0,"The script is perfect, all the temporal intertwining are well linked together. Everyone's interpretation is magnificent, especially by M. J. Fox and C. Lloyd who are always credible. The director managed to convey the right atmosphere, to make people smile and to make people think. Beautiful and impressive soundtrack. One of the few films from the 1980s whose special effects are still believable today!"
18.12.2021,8.0,"I don't know dude but this movie was childhood movie very worthy, when sometime i have a kid i will show my kid back to the future then they know old childhood movies is wonderful."
16.12.2021,9.0,"I must have seen this movie at least 5, 6 times through all my life even tho I have never reviewed it. Why I am doing it now then? Well, a while ago I saw an episode of THE MOVIES THAT MADE US where they discussed the fact that Eric Stoltz (who went on to be Rocky Dennis in MASK) was the original Marty McFly but he was fired because he thought that the movie was a drama and not a comedy as Robert Zemeckis intended it. And despite today there are only a few glimpses of Stoltz's original footage, the version we all know is just great.As there are already more than 1,350 reviews for this movie already I'll be brief. High school student Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time to 1955 with the invention of a time machine created by his eccentric friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Marty meets his parents when they were not married yet and for adjusting things in the future he makes them meet again in a wiser way so that in 1985 there will be positive changes.The acting is good. Michael J. Fox was born for the role of Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd is great in one of his most memorable roles along that of Judge Doom of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT. The soundtrack is among the best for a movie of this genre and gives also lots of nostalgic vibes. And the script is very funny and witty.Overall, one of those family movies that stands the test of time and manages to be safe for younger folks. A rare quality in today's family movies."
16.12.2021,9.0,"This is a great movie from my childhood. It used to be shown on TV frequently until the 2000s. I rewatched it after many years from a more critical point of view. It has a genuine screenplay and includes many great characters. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are great lead actors. But this is not all, the supporting cast (Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, ...) is also awesome. The movie has very nice settings, visual effects and songs. All these give successfully the impression of a fictional world. This is one movie that every child should see before growing up."
14.12.2021,10.0,"Not much I can say that hasnt been said about this movie. People and critics often say Steven Spielberg and the huge movies wrecked Hollywood well WE ALL DISAGREE films like this, Jaws ,Raiders, Alien,Gladiator, all the way up to Guardians of the galaxy the big budget film has its home . I cant imagine a world without Back to the future in it, and the cast what a GIFT they gave to us , we get to enjoy Michael J Fox Cristopher Lloyd, Lea, etc. Forever!!TO THE CAST AND CREW BRAVO!!THANK YOU!!!"
09.12.2021,10.0,"The pairing of Fox and Lloyd is nair unbeatable. I know that Eric Stoltz was the original marty and he is a great actor. However Fox IS and always will be Marty McFly, its a heart warming, action packed, laugh riot of a family movie and a great way of capturing the memories of the 80s."
08.12.2021,10.0,"BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of my favourite movies, even if it was released before I was born. It is very funny and full of suspense, memorable scenes and even inspirational quotes.The time travel theme was a new one back then, but the cast delivered a fantastic performance to the public."
07.12.2021,10.0,"(There is a little spoiler but it wont ruin your experience at all) I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I love how the original this is, and the fact that the sequels are so similar, but they are both so good, especially the 3rd film. This movie has such witty humor, and it is good from start to finish. It is actually really suspenseful, along with the other films. I cant believe the CGI was this good for a movie made in 1985! The casttttttt, Christopher Lloyd is one of my favorite actors just for this role ""Great scott, this is such a good movie"" and Michael J Fox is a really good character and him meeting his young dad was really funny. Overall a 10/10 film and is in my top 5."
04.12.2021,8.0,"Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager in Hill Valley, California in 1985 - and then in 1955. Dr Emmett Brown's time machine has flung Marty 30 years back in time and he's stranded there unless the 1955 Doc Brown can help him. Worse: Marty's own mother, here a high school teenager, is falling for him instead of his father.It sounds like a clichéd science fiction movie that could only appeal to fans of the genre - but that couldn't be more wrong. A huge hit, it appealed across the board for its invention, its exuberant energy, and the famous finale - so tense, so very exciting and yet able to make you gasp and laugh at the same time."
04.12.2021,8.0,"Back to the Future makes time travel not only fun, but also brings science fiction to the masses in a comedic adventure that follows teenager Marty McFly, played Michael J. Fox. Fox makes this movie click. His charming qualities and well-timed lines with his co-stars, including Christopher Lloyd (Dr Emmett Brown) and Leah Thompson, will find you cheering and laughing throughout the movie.Back to the Future is a perfect flick for those with school-aged children on up. This film has some mild fighting and name calling."

30.11.2021,8.0,"Time travel from 1985 to 1955, back to 1985,, on to 2015,, back to 1985,, back to 1955,,, then onto 1855,,, ending with a last time jump back to 1985!! I know,, a lot to keep up with,,,Classic all the way!! What else can be said about this treasure of a movie from the 1980s/my childhood?Quotes - ""Great Scott!"" & ""This is heavy.""8.5 rating is right!!"
17.11.2021,10.0,"Review By Kamal KEverything about Back To The Future is awesome, well, almost everything. Marty McFly, or, Calven Klein's adventure in the 50's is kinda awkward sometimes, specifically everything to do with younger Lorrain. The amount of thirst in those scenes was astounding. Throughout the movie, events are changed in such a way that the future still happens, but everyone seemingly ""grew up"" in terms of character development, like Marty McFly's dad going from a cowardly man child to someone actually capable of defending himself, but the sequel shows the one in actual need of growing up is Marty McFly himself. Old Marty is a lot like young George McFly, and lets people take advantage of him. The next sequel, Back to The Future 3 shows Marty McFly grow in character, and by the end of the film he isn't a reckless chode with a ""I'm not a chicken"" complex. George McFly takes a single movie to develope character whereas it takes 3 adventures for Marty McFly to grow as a character, and it's all entertaining to watch. Final Verdict 10/10."
16.11.2021,10.0,"The title says it all! Nothing can compare to this film! There's few films I can watch over and over again, but every year I watch this and each time it brings the same joy as the first time I watched!"
15.11.2021,10.0,"I'm not one of those who throw around the word ""masterpiece"" in every sentence. Heck I'm not even that much of a sci-fi fan but this movie is just so outstanding and fun. There ware very few movies which ties everything that happens in the plot and the loose-ends, throwbacks etc so smoothly and perfectly by the end. Michael J. Fox did and absolutely wonderful job playing the role of Marty mcfky and I don't think any other actor in the world would fit the role so much. The story is awesome, fun and very entertaining with the mix of perfect humor. Overall a very engaging and re-watchable movie."
09.11.2021,9.0,Very amusing and fun. Amusant if you will. The only thing that would've made it better was if marty had superstrength and could fly. I recommend this film to people of all ages.
09.11.2021,10.0,The storyline is so complex. Really enjoy the movie. Always will be a classic. This movie never loses its fire and will live on for generations to come.

But, Marty has to deal with a new lifestyle in 1955, how to act, and even his young parents.... Go watch Back to the Future!!"
07.10.2021,10.0,One of a few movies that never ages. 'Back to the Future' is a kind of film that gets better and better with the passage of time. A movie you can watch over and over again.Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown and Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly steals the show in this amazingly good Robert Zemeckis' Masterpiece. Time travel can never be funnier and cooler than that!One of those movies no one can remake and One of the Greatest Classics ever!
06.10.2021,10.0,"A masterpiece without a doubt, and for me the best science fiction film in the history of cinema (and especially comedy), a family to enjoy a lot and family, and that they are one of those films that when you finish them you have a smile on your face. Face of satisfaction, extraordinary script and an extraordinary charisma of all people. A must see movie."
03.10.2021,10.0,"What can you say... Back to the Future, one of the most wonderful movies ever!"
29.09.2021,9.0,"Because if you watch it ten times or more, you begin to see poor quality details of the movie. It doesn't mean that the movie is not good. It is still a nice movie. But if you watch it ten times, you remember some poor quality details of it. And you can't remember this as a great movie. Because you know it is a movie and there are some shooting mistakes or maybe low budget details and something like that. If you watch it two or three times in twenty years, that is great. Because you only remember good parts of the movie. You remember just that goodness. And you can say ""yes it is a great movie"". But when you say that you don't remember the whole film actually. Because you watched it ten years ago.That's all."
08.09.2021,10.0,"This is the definitive movie to watch if u love time travel movies. Not only has comedy, action and jokes, the time machine(the delorean dmc 12) is a worlwide recognized vehicle. The actors all play believing in the plot, the pace is never slow, and the music is great."
03.09.2021,9.0,"Well what can I say that hasn't already been said, just watch the film."
02.09.2021,10.0,"I remember watching this as a kid and just rewatching it over and over and over again because I didn't get bored of the movie because of how the plot the characters and the setting was so good, this is why this is my favorite movie of all time and the second one, Robert Zemeckis knows how to direct a film very well and he showed off his talents here thank you."
29.08.2021,10.0,The greatest of all time. This movies ability to reference little things from early sections of the movie is amazing. It's beautifully made with a fun storyline for all generations. This is a must see if you love movies.
24.08.2021,4.0,"It may be regarded as a classic but I never liked it, it is 80s cheesy like the bad guys are unwatchable it's that bad. Doc is annoying too."

15.08.2021,10.0,"Back to the Future is cinema history! One of the best blockbusters of the 80s and why not, of history. It has charismatic and endearing characters like Mary McFly (Michael J. Fox), Dr. Emmet (C. Lloyd), Lorraine (L. Thompson) and many more, an easy to understand story that has a very dynamic rhythm and obviously a soundtrack that is still remembered today. If you haven't seen it yet, I don't know what you're waiting for."
