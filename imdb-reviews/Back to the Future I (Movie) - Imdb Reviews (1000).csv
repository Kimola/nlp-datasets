03.08.2025,10.0,"This is the best movie ever, everyone rate it 10, great casting it should be #1, great story, great direction by Robert Zemeckis and incredible entertainment. All time adventure. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the best movie duo ever.Soundtrack is beautiful and iconic. Editing and production wow.From Einstein to The Hill Valley courthouse, from Johnny B. Goode to 88 mph scenes... I can go on and on, so many incredible details and entertaining ""heart-pounding"" scenes in this movie.The Shawshank redemption is nothing compared to this movie. Maybe it's not nothing but definitely is not better than BTTF.This one with BTTF part 2 and part 3 = The Best Trilogy of all Time."
03.05.2025,5.0,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Marty McFly is a very likable, well-acted character. The film starts out pretty well, introducing Marty's family and other characters, although it does take some time before the time travelling (from 1985 to 1955) occurs - The scenes with the Libyan terrorists at the parking lot seem to drag on and on. Also, what are Libyan terrorists doing in Los Angeles in the 1980s? Anyways...I would've liked to know how Doc met Marty. I mean, how would a 'cool' kid like Marty be friends with a 50+ year old geeky old guy? This isn't really a flaw, but just an honest contemplation. Speaking of the two, the ending dragged for too long. I won't spoil it. But the scene with Marty and Doc waiting for the lightning to strike at the clock became nauseating. I'm guessing the creators were just trying to show off the special effects and sound effects, which seemed pretty good for that time. But I didn't like it and that sequence killed the film's pace. Also, the movie ended in a way that leads to the sequel. So for those expecting a standalone film, you will not be satisfied.The music score by Alan Silvestri is classic and memorable. The characters are also very likable, hence why the film has a classic status. But I still feel it was let-down by the drawn out, bloating ending sequence near the clock tower."
23.02.2025,8.0,"Back to the Future is a near-perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy, and adventure that remains just as entertaining today as it was in 1985. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and featuring a fantastic cast, this film captures the essence of fun, excitement, and nostalgia in one unforgettable time-travel story.Michael J. Fox shines as Marty McFly, a relatable and charismatic teenager who finds himself accidentally sent back to 1955 in a DeLorean-turned-time-machine. His chemistry with Christopher Lloyd's eccentric Doc Brown is nothing short of iconic, making for some of the most memorable moments in film history. The story is fast-paced, filled with humor, and has just the right amount of emotional weight, especially when Marty tries to fix his parents' relationship.Alan Silvestri's triumphant score and the '80s rock soundtrack give the movie its energetic feel, while the practical effects and clever script make the time-travel mechanics easy to follow. If there's any flaw, it's that some of the science is more fantasy than logic, but honestly, that's part of the fun.Overall, Back to the Future is an endlessly rewatchable classic that still holds up today. It's got adventure, comedy, and heart-all wrapped up in a thrilling time-travel journey."
18.02.2025,10.0,"Back to the Future is a film that has firmly secured its place in my heart, and it's one I can watch on repeat without ever growing tired of it. From the very first time I saw it as a kid, I was instantly hooked. I know the entire movie by heart-the dialogue, the iconic scenes, and every memorable moment have been etched in my memory.The genius of Robert Zemeckis shines through as we follow the time-traveling adventures of Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox. As a child, I couldn't help but develop the biggest crush on Marty. His charm, wit, and rebellious spirit made him the quintessential hero for young audiences like me. Who could resist that iconic skateboard ride or the perfect blend of bravado and heart?This film is a true classic that masterfully combines science fiction, adventure, and comedy, all wrapped up in an engaging and entertaining story. The concept of time travel, with its potential for mishaps and adventures, captivated my imagination and sparked countless daydreams about what I would change in my own timeline.Back to the Future isn't just a film I watched; it's an experience that has stayed with me throughout my life. Its themes of friendship, perseverance, and the casual certainty that life can lead to unexpected twists are messages that resonate deeply. It's a film I hold dear to my heart, and sitting down to watch it always feels like visiting an old friend."
15.02.2025,10.0,"Back to the Future is the greatest film in every way. The characters are perfect and funny. The story is amazing and some-what grounded. The music is absolutely magnificent. Doc and Marty are the perfect duo (being solar opposites) and references and little Easter eggs you can catch on your future viewings are absolutely mind blowing and comes to show what a great screenplay Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale made. If your looking for a funny, sci-fi, romance, action, 80s classic look no further than Back to the Future. One of if not Steven Spielberg's best film ever made besides Jaws.""Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads."" - Dr. Emmett Brown."
08.02.2025,10.0,"Ultimate American summer blockbuster. Incredibly clever, nostalgia-packed, and never gets old. Just when it would seem that Steven Spielberg has touched all possible forms of fantasy, he comes up with another one that not only plucks, but plays a complete symphony, on the heartstrings. It's all fiendishly complicated but Zemeckis is an inventive filmmaker with a knack for the happy ending. Disney would have been proud of him -- and more than a little envious of an entertainment which takes a risk or two, and has a ball doing it. I loved it was timeless and I could gladly watch it over and over and over again."

07.01.2025,10.0,"This is a fun, irresistible and original film. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sophisticated. The cinematography, scenery and costumes are excellent. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in his role and so is Michael J Fox, he is also brilliant in his role as Marty Mc Fly. This is overally a brilliant film that is good in so many ways. Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect. The story is awesome. It is delivered cleverly and entertainingly. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something to watch."
05.01.2025,10.0,"I've never written a movie review, despite having watched so many that I've lost count. I was born in 1981, so when this movie came out, I was just a child. Over 40 years have passed, and I can confidently say that this is the movie I've watched the most times in my entire life. Every time I'm channel surfing and this movie is on, I simply can't resist watching it again. The remote stops right there. I think that says it all. For me, this is the best movie ever made.It doesn't fit into any specific genre, in my opinion. It's simply Back to the Future. For those who lived through the '80s and '90s, they'll surely understand its charm. For those who didn't, I don't have the insight to make any judgment, but I believe it's timeless."
30.12.2024,4.0,"In the mainstream Hollywood movies of the 1980s, America was a nation in the process of reconciliation. This reconciliation aims to repair the wounds inflicted on America by the movements of the 1960s and the divisions of the 1970s.So Hollywood in the 1980s tells the story of reconciliation between two generations. In the 1982 film ""The Golden Pond,"" not only did Henry Fonda's grandfather and grandson reach mutual understanding, but he also reached mutual forgiveness with his daughter, Jane Fonda, both in the film and in reality. In 1983, the once popular Star Wars series also reached its final chapter, in which the evil father Black Knight was finally influenced by his son Luke, who sacrificed himself to save him."
29.12.2024,10.0,This movie is a great start of a movie franchise and the writing is awesome. The characters are so greatly written in a way that makes total sense and the learning process is great. The time process doesn't really have any plot holes. The dad glow up is insane and the songs that are in it are amazing the post credit scene is a great way to leave a cliffhanger. It amazing that falling out of a tree and getting hit by a car lead his mother falling in love with him and him having to have his dad fight his high school bully for her to fall in love with him was a great come back for his wimpy character.

09.12.2024,10.0,"What else can really be said about Back to the Future? This beloved movie has been praised in so many ways over the years, that i cant even think of a original thing to say about it. It's a classic, a masterpiece of modern american cinema, one of the most rewatchable movies of all time. Michael J Fox is incredible, Christopher Lloyd is incredible, Lea Thompson is incredible, Crispin Glover is incredible, EVERYONE is incredible in this goddamn film! The direction, the script, etc... Everything is so tight and well put togheter, it's amazing! One of those rare ""lightning in the bottle"" moments in cinema history, when everything that was suppose to go right, GOES RIGHT!"
08.12.2024,10.0,"This was the movie that made me love science fiction movies. I was around 7 years old when I first watched it and I really enjoyed it. Years have passed since I first watched it, but I still watch the movie with the same admiration, it was really great. I thought the movie was pretty good for an 80's movie. The movie's story is also a very original and carefully written story. There are also many references to this movie (The first movie of the movie serie) in the other movies of the movie serie.It was truly one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, and also the best time travel movie I've ever seen. This movie is really worth watching I definitely recommend it to everyone."
01.12.2024,10.0,"The epitome of excellence in Hollywood, ""Back to the Future"" is timeless, inspiring, and memeable. The pace here is seamless, every moment has plot significance, and every word uttered is valuable and meaningful. This careful crafting of visual presentation, audible experience and narrative concept existed at a time of relative peace and stability in the American economy. Little did we know everything would go downhill from here: an era of complete uncertainty leading to massive corporate greed, a sharp drop in production quality, and an industry absorbed by politics instead of artform. The laisse faire attitude of 80s Hollywood management allowed for more directorial creativity and oversight, compared to the complicated and overzealous requirements demanded by today's itchy fingered producers and executives.""Back to the Future"" deals with very common human issues such as self-esteem, effort and maturity, all while presenting an intriguing premise, pressing matters, romance, friendship and conflict all rolled into one. If the definition of Art is ""the mirror we hold up to ourselves"" (Shakespeare, Hamlet), then the imitation of nature that this science fiction dramedy presents is among the best in the craft of filmmaking: It's not about the science or the fiction; it's about people.Today's world poses many threats to studio success: legal action can be taken if your production presents defamatory or misleading information; social backlash can arise from a lack of respect to the genre or franchise; studio acceptance can be jeopardized from simple misrepresentation of race or gender... what we have now is a literal minefield of judicial hurdles, social media timebombs and the precarious balancing of identity politics over qualification and competence in hiring. Its no wonder, then, that activists, poles, statistics and even artificial intelligence have taken center stage in the development of studio projects: every obstacle to success must be accounted for. The excessive hand holding has led to a soulless industry, one so obsessed with minutia, that its now incapable of seeing the forest from the trees. Art has completely left the building, replaced by obligation to pretense and the third quarter. Hopefully, future generations will rely on past productions, such as this one, for inspiration, guidance, and understanding of the human experience."
29.11.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is a near-perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, and adventure, earning high praise for its clever storytelling, memorable characters, and infectious energy. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg, this iconic film has stood the test of time, captivating audiences with its creativity and timeless appeal.The story follows teenager Marty McFly, played with charm and charisma by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a time machine invented by the eccentric Dr Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd. Marty's quest to return to 1985 becomes a race against time as he inadvertently disrupts his parents' first meeting, threatening his very existence.Fox delivers an effortlessly engaging performance, bringing humour and relatability to Marty as he navigates the past with a mix of resourcefulness and teenage awkwardness. Lloyd is equally outstanding as Doc, with his larger-than-life energy and wild-eyed enthusiasm creating one of cinema's most beloved characters. The dynamic between Marty and Doc is the heart of the film, with their unlikely friendship driving much of the story's charm.The script, co-written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, is a masterpiece of structure and wit, deftly weaving together humour, tension, and heartfelt moments. The way the film balances the high stakes of time travel with light-hearted comedy is nothing short of genius. From the hilariously awkward scenes with Marty's teenage mother to the nail-biting clock tower sequence, every moment feels perfectly calibrated.Alan Silvestri's iconic score amplifies the film's sense of adventure and wonder, while the 1980s rock hits, particularly Huey Lewis and the News' The Power of Love, give the film its unforgettable vibe. The production design is equally impressive, capturing both the 1980s and 1950s with meticulous attention to detail, making the time-jump feel immersive and authentic.The only minor drawback is that certain elements of the plot, particularly the more dated social dynamics, may not resonate as strongly with modern audiences. However, these moments do little to detract from the film's overall impact.In conclusion, Back to the Future is an endlessly entertaining and cleverly crafted film that continues to delight viewers of all ages. With its sharp humour, heartwarming story, and unforgettable performances, it has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films of all time. A near-flawless adventure that is as timeless as its title suggests."
21.11.2024,10.0,"Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack."
12.11.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is a film that holds a special place in my heart, and watching it again recently reminded me why it's such a timeless classic. From the moment the iconic DeLorean roars to life, I was transported back to a world where time travel is not just a fantasy, but a thrilling adventure. The film's blend of humor, science fiction, and heartwarming moments creates an experience that resonates with audiences of all ages.Michael J. Fox's portrayal of Marty McFly is nothing short of iconic. His youthful exuberance and relatable struggles make him an endearing protagonist. And then there's Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown, whose eccentricity and wisdom provide the perfect counterbalance to Marty's character. Their chemistry is electric, and every scene they share is filled with laughter and genuine emotion.The screenplay is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving together themes of friendship, family, and the consequences of our choices. I found myself laughing at the clever nods to the 1950s culture while also appreciating the film's deeper messages. The way it tackles the idea of altering one's own past and the ripple effects that can have is both thought-provoking and entertaining.The soundtrack, particularly the unforgettable theme by Alan Silvestri, adds an extra layer of magic to the film. It's one of those scores that sticks with you long after the credits roll, evoking a sense of nostalgia and adventure.Watching Back to the Future in a packed theater, surrounded by fellow fans, was an experience I'll cherish. The collective gasps, laughter, and cheers made me realize how this film transcends generations. It's a movie that sparks joy, ignites conversations, and leaves you with a smile on your face.In a world where films often come and go, Back to the Future remains a shining beacon of creativity and fun. It's a film I can revisit time and time again, discovering new nuances with each viewing. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience this cinematic gem. It's not just a movie; it's a journey through time that you won't want to miss."
09.11.2024,8.0,"Balancing Sci Fi with Comedy and Drama is one of the hardest combinations in the entertainment industry, and 'Back to the Future' nails it almost perfectly. The blend of wit, charm and consideration creates a tasty and wholesome family movie with a sense of consequence for the character's actions.Michael J. Fox is sensational, giving that comical edge to take the pressure off you while also feeling human and grounded. Christopher Lloyd is marvellous. Crispin Glover is beautiful as this pathetic man at the centre at it all. Tom Wilson makes his first appearance although out of the three he has the least impact.The sense of place and atmosphere is striking, largely due to great well lit cinematography and steady handed screenplay. It's textbook brilliance for the period and deserving as a cultural icon."
03.11.2024,9.0,"Probably one of the best, if not the best, trilogies ever made and also one of my personal favourites. Always had a soft spot for this film since I was a little kid.Watching the film I could not but think about the brilliance of the script and the direction. I always trust Tarantino on this, as he says, the perfect movie.I don't know what makes this film great: the concept, the performances, the chemistry between Marty and Doc, the music, the 80's setting, the sci-fi elements, the romantic comedy elements-or maybe it's all of that? How can all of those elements coexist in one single film without destroying it?I guess that that's what would happen today, and it is not what happened in 1985, certainly not when you have Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis around."
18.10.2024,9.0,"Great time travel DMC DeLorean , memorable characters and very likable dialogues. And one that will stick in your head for a long time is Doc! It's a fun and feel-good movie. I've watched it since I was a kid and I've watched it over 10 times now and I'm still not bored of it. It's a really good memory. Although the rest of the series are fun, the first series is still the best. But there might be a downside, maybe only in the Dub zone of my country, some words are not translated correctly, so I had to find the English version to watch. When watching both languages, it's fun in different ways."
17.10.2024,10.0,"I just got done watching Back to the Future (1985) for the first time ever and I absolutely loved every single minute of this movie.Positives for Back to the Future (1985):
The movie's premise is absolutely brilliant to where you have this boy going back in time and see what the world was like when his parents were teenagers. This is a premise that has been done multiple times since this movie first came out and while some of them have come close, none have been able to capture the magic of this original movie. The other thing that makes this movie work is the cast of characters and the actors portraying them. First off you have Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly who is easily one of the best movie characters in the history of cinema and he's one of those characters who you easily relate to because of his natural on-screen presence and charisma. Then you have Christopher Lloyd as Emmett ""Doc"" Brown and this guy is one of the most entertaining and ecentric characters that you can't help but love him. I also enjoyed Crispin Glover as George McFly and Lea Thompson as Lorraine Baines McFly and their interactions with Marty are so fun to watch. Then you have Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen is one of the most easy to hate villains in cinematic history and he's not even one of these evil cartoonish villains that we see a lot in movies, he's just a big mean bully in high school and we all hate those people. The movie's score by Alan Silvestri is easily among one of the movie scores I've heard in any movie. The special effects for the time-travel sequences are phenomenal and they still hold up to this day. And finally, I just how good-natured this movie is with its approach and it's one of those comfort movies that you can watch at anytime in your life.Overall, Back to the Future (1985) is one of the greatest movies of all time.amd if you haven't watched this movie yet and then you need to watch it as soon as possible."
10.09.2024,7.0,This movie is a lot of fun the whole way through I love doc and Marty is a fun protagonist. The idea of what's going on and time travel has probably happened a lot but it stems from this and you can see why I think the ending is super sweet and how it just has full confidence and is like oh we have an idea for a sequel too is great cause it shows they had fun doing this and will do more which is great cause nowadays sequels feel forced and undeserved but this is just a whole lot of fun and def deserving of a sequal i remember watching 2 & 3 when I was younger and I'm excited to revisit them this month before they leave Netflix.
08.09.2024,8.0,"Back to the Future is a movie ahead of its time, utilizing an array of incredible effects that were unseen for its era. The narrative is super simple yet captivating, with a well-constructed story that avoids leaving any plot holes. The performances are amazing, and it has become an iconic film in pop culture.Elements like the Delorean and the concept of a time machine through a car are very original and practical, featuring a highly empathetic and human protagonist, with flaws and merits. The only downside to the film is certain sexist aspects of the time, based on the culture in which it was released."
07.09.2024,10.0,"Classic one of my favorite childhood movie, Literally, one of the best serious picture of all time. I have been watching this movie so many times, including the movie. The other the fantasy is going back literally one of the greatest idea. The acting is phenomenal and the effect horse back at the time revolutionary. I wish the day really did another movie in the series, this movie is enjoyable and it's not too long. It's perfect in terms of timing. I don't understand why all the new movies it's over three hours and you can really make movie in 90 minutes., Recommended to all the young generation that did not grew up on this movie."
06.09.2024,9.0,"Great 80's film. Hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually.9/10."
05.09.2024,10.0,"Back to the Future is one of those very nostalgic films.I remember exactly the day I received a box set with the three films from a friend of my mother. As it was late at night, I couldn't run the marathon. The next day I watched them all and immediately fell in love.All the settings, characters and stories leave everything characteristic and original, mainly due to the time in which it was made.Michael J. Fox Christopher Lloyd form a duo with perfect chemistry. No wonder they are called for interviews and lectures about the three films to this day.If there's one tip I can give to parents of children old enough to understand the story, it's: don't waste any more time, have a movie session at home to watch these three classics of world cinema with your children."
05.09.2024,10.0,"This is how a movie should be done. It's perfection from start to finish. I remember the first time that I saw it and I remember my house, the tv, the food that I was eating the happiness the nostalgia. If anyone doesn't like Back to the future he/she must be empty inside. There's no way to not love this perfection.The cinematography the story the comedy the actors everything is perfect and there's even 1 second of the movie that is boring. Everything is fast paced.

25.08.2024,9.0,"I love this film and can rewatch it every day if I can. The critiques of this film usually have a complaint about the ""scifi"" aspect of it, whether it justifies the science behind time travel or not. I would say that Back to the Future is like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. It falls more on the adventure-comedy genre than science-fiction. Everything that's happening here taken place in a fifth dimension that is beyond science and superstition.You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination."
23.08.2024,10.0,"I recently watched Back to the Future (1985) on Netflix. The storyline follows Marty McFly, a high school student dealing with the fallout of his father being bullied by his boss, which affects the entire family dynamic. His best friend, a quirky scientist, has been working on a time travel experiment. When Marty is called to help test the invention, the experiment works-but with tragic consequences, as the scientist is killed, and Marty is accidentally sent back in time. Now, Marty must find a way to change the course of history to help his family while also figuring out how to return home.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), the film stars Michael J. Fox (Teen Wolf), Christopher Lloyd (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), Lea Thompson (Howard the Duck), Crispin Glover (Willard), and Tom Wilson (Action Jackson).Back to the Future is 80s nostalgic gold in every way-storyline, characters, soundtrack, comedic elements, and its optimistic take on the core premise. The entire film is beautifully written, with Marty McFly being an easy character to root for. Michael J. Fox perfectly captures Marty's carefree and fun-loving nature. Crispin Glover delivers an underrated performance as Marty's quirky dad, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as the eccentric scientist. The depiction of the 1950s is pure fun, and the idea of a son inadvertently impacting his parents' relationship is both clever and engaging. The weaving together of time travel and family plots comes together seamlessly, culminating in a heartwarming full-circle ending. The Huey Lewis and the News soundtrack is iconic, and it's impossible not to love this film.In conclusion, Back to the Future is wholesome American cinematic gold and an absolute must-see. I would score it a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
16.08.2024,5.0,"This story is essentially a small, weak, dumb kid sort of accidentally travels back in time, makes irrationally bad decisions and then somehow triumphs in the end.When I saw this movie as a kid I thought it was pretty silly but fun, and if I was writing IMDB reviews in the 90s I probably would have rated it a 7/10. For anyone with a mind remotely based in science or logic nearly everything comes off too stupid or illogical to enjoy this movie. Marty McFly makes a terrible decision in nearly every situation and seems to keep forgetting that he traveled back In time. I can see how the bottom half of the population would identify with this idiotic protagonist and how some fan boys would love these movies despite their flaws, but I don't understand how anyone not in those categories could rate any of these movies above a 6.Some specifics that I don't think qualify as spoilers:
-Marty's family photo (from the ""future"") starts to fade based on his actions. This makes ZERO sense; if you altered your future and negated your existence, you wouldn't exist and the photo wouldn't exist. If they wanted to try and make scientific sense it would have been more like Schrödinger's Cat where Marty disappears intermittently and the photo changes.-After traveling back in time Marty seems to never remember he came from the future and makes every silly blunder possible to create issues for himself. He makes no attempt to blend in when it matters most, and in every situation he seems just as confused and flabbergasted that he's in the last, even though it's very clear he knows he is. It's sort of like he's willfully ignorant and is pretending to not remember he went back in time at only the worst times (aka bad writing)."
05.08.2024,10.0,"This is the greatest movie I have ever seen, my favorite of all time. I just love this movie so much. It has everything a great movie needs. A great cast, a great script, great characters, great plot, great scenes, great everything. From the beginning to the end, it is amazing. I just get a great, indescribable feeling when I watch it. Every time I can, I view it. There is quite literally nothing wrong with it. As Michael J. Fox said, ""It's ironic that a movie about time travel is timeless."" I totally agree. I hope, some day, I can show my children this movie, and they will love it as well. And as Forrest Gump said (which is kinda ironic because Robert Zemeckis directed both Forrest Gump and Back To The Future,) ""That's all I have to say about that."""
22.07.2024,10.0,"*Back to the Future* is more than just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that captures the essence of imagination and adventure in a way that transcends generations.

05.07.2024,10.0,"I haven't watched this in years, but our family is watching movies this holiday and Back to the Future series is up.And it holds up. Or, rather, it holds up enough, because obviously someone editing the same movie in 2024 might make a few other choices.On the other hand, I see plenty that is superior to the fare we regularly get now.Of course, Michael J Fox is a favorite, but how fun to see the entire cast in ensemble and remember how talented each casting choice was.The music is just exceptional in this series, substantial but fun, lifting and carrying the chase sequences especially.It's funny to see product placement in a movie I think of as a box office hit and even legendary. However, the placements themselves almost add to the fun as we look at the 1980's looking at the 1950's from the vantages of the 2020's. (What a trip.)"
05.07.2024,9.0,"This is literally my reason for being fascinated by scifi movies. This movie is a gem and it deserves atleast a *9* from me. Out of all the Pros of the film, I may summarise them as :
1. Vfx is top notch for its time.2. After watching Alan Silvestri's name, you don't need to analyse more on the music stuff.3. Rhe plot is well written and well executed. No potholes, or bad/awkward moments.4. Screenplay was good.5. Even if the plot has extreme situations, good writing makes it better.This is, as far as I'm concerned, the best time travel movie I've witnessed.Lets appreciate it and give the makers what they deserve."

02.07.2024,10.0,"Why did they remove the half fence from all 3 of the movies, it added a different twist to the endings and kept everything in the correct court?I am now 73. Saw BTTF when it was first released. Instant classic, even if the so-called experts didn't see it at that time. Perfect foreshadowing. Perfect acting, not only by the major stars, but also by the bit players - Goldie Wilson, the clock tower lady, Lorraine's parents, Strickland, Dave and Linda, Marvin Berry, the Peabody family (you killed a pine!). Perfect dialogue with many repeatable and memorable lines or phrases - butthead, flux capacitor, what's a rerun?, who the hell is John F. Kennedy, give me a milk - chocolate, I'm your density, 1.21 giggawats, 88 miles per hour, we don't need roads, etc. Silvestri's score is one of the most recognizable in cinema history. When supplemented with Huey Lewis hits , and the Starlighter's songs, the music is also a perfect fit. Truly an iconic film which has, and will always remain one of the greatest feel good movies ever."

24.06.2024,10.0,"The Delorian is such a fun vehicle and I love the way they use it in this movie! Ten stars for sure. It reminds me of when I was a kid and when my father would quote the scenes from the movie. Michael did an amazing job as Marty McFly in Back to the Future. It will always remind me of the good old days when my pops says ""Roads, where we're going, we don't need roads."". And ""I finally invented something that works."" Haha. I would really like to see another version of this movie come out now! I hope that they come out with one eventually because it was absolutely amazing. 10/10. Anyways, great movie!"
23.06.2024,9.0,"Modern movie makers have so much to learn from this movie. After 15min everything is setup, we know all the characters, the later pay off is ready to go, and everything is well written, no dialogue is wasted and there are no modern sensitivity issues. And, although we do not know it watching this movie, the sequels are already setup too. Great filmmaking.The movie has great pace, a lot of things happen, but everything feels logical and to the point.A few negatives of course. Especially from a modern point of view. The computer graphics do not hold up, some of the time travel shenanigans does not work (since we know what happens in ""the future""). But perhaps the only real negative is how campy and basic everything feels. I also feel the sets are not always on point.From one of the best movie years of all time, 1985, this classic and mastery of filmmaking is of course to this day still very much watchable.A 9/10 and a must see for every lover of great cinema."
18.06.2024,7.0,"In the mid-1980s, screenwriters Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had a great idea. Wouldn't it be fun to make a film about a young guy who travels back in time and meets his own parents? When his folks are also teenagers, that is? Unfortunately, their enthusiasm was not shared by a single soul in Hollywood. No one wanted to invest money in such a whacky project. But then, when Zemeckis scored a hit with ""Romancing the Stone"" everything changed. Suddenly every studio in town wanted to do business with the two friends.Robert Zemeckis started shooting ""Back to the Future"" in November 1984. From the beginning, Eric Stoltz was supposed to have the lead role. But although Stoltz was an excellent actor, the director soon realized that he wasn't the right man for the part. So, Zemeckis turned instead to Michael J. Fox, star of the immensely popular sitcom ""Family Ties"". And luckily, Fox was keen to do the job. Even though it meant working on two gruelling projects at the same time.When Michael J. Fox sets off on his time-traveling trip, he uses a gleaming, modified DeLorean. However, that wasn't the case in Zemeckis and Gale's original script. The two authors had actually intended that the journey would start in a converted refrigerator (?) out in the hero's kitchen. Soon, however, the two scriptwriters realized that this could cause problems. Imagine if some kid was inspired by the movie and got trapped inside the family's fridge.Not surprisingly, ""Back to the Future"" became a smash hit, even surpassing ""Romancing the Stone"" at the box office. The film also made Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale the hottest scriptwriting team in Hollywood. In addition, John DeLorean sent a letter thanking the filmmakers for immortalizing his futuristic car. But the biggest proof of the movie's popularity was that Universal Pictures installed ""Back to the Future"" rides in their theme parks in California and Florida."
15.06.2024,8.0,"I saw this movie enough times I lost count. I don't want to watch ""Back to the Future"" ever again unless there is a version which has Elisabeth Shue in on it ;) I like the first movie a lot, but it isn't the best movie in the series. The best character in this movie is that little, dog Einstein who seem to have started this adventure in the first place :) I wanted to see more of this dog. The second best character in this movie is none other than Doc I reckon who still looks the same in 1985 :) And so does Mr Strickland :) I like George in this movie, but I wanted him to be a man. George was too much of a wimp! I did like the other characters especially Biff Tannen, the bully, but I wanted to see Biff's Grandma :) Even what the inside of his home looks like. You saw Biff's garage. I like manure also :) Back to the Future is an excellent movie. 9/10."
13.06.2024,10.0,"Definitely NOT the best movie ever made, kinda sloppy and barely cracks top 15. It is indeed simple and superficial, plus I gotta agree on the fact that this might not be actual science fiction. Still, my childhood thrived on this franchise and I still get excited rewatch after rewatch. Furthermore, this movie was the first piece of fiction to make me love the 50s and 80s and in general vintage culture.So, if I have to rate cold-blooded on technical quality only, without letting feelings interfere? Well, I'm afraid it's a 6 at best.But if I have to be honest, cinema is more than just technique, so from the heart I'd say it's a 10.And only a chicken wouldn't follow his heart."
11.06.2024,7.0,"I recently watched a movie with a simple linear story in the time travel genre that I found really enjoyable. The movie revolves around a teenage boy named Marty who helps a scientist named Doc Brown test his time machine. However, Marty ends up traveling back in time and has to find his way back to the present.The movie's plot, while simple, still holds up and can be quite enjoyable. However, I felt that compared to more recent time-travel movies with complex and interesting storylines, this one may seem a bit basic. The plot revolves around a teen helping another teen get his dream girl and stand up to his bully but with time travel involved. This plot didn't work for me. But I didn't regret watching it.The acting in the movie was generally good, although I felt that the actors who played George and Lorraine overacted in their scenes. The cinematography was impressive for its time, and the music added to the overall enjoyment of the film. The pacing of the movie was just right, not too fast or slow.Overall, I found the movie fun to watch, but I was hoping for a more complex or thrilling storyline, rather than the teen drama that it turned out to be. I'd rate this movie a 7 because of its simple plot, but otherwise, it's a good watch."
04.06.2024,10.0,"Generation spanning movie. Kids, teens, adults, olders all love it. It has no wasted scenes, no bad dialog really, and no reliance on special effects.I can't really think of another movie so perfect for what it was. End Game maybe as the pinnacle super hero movie to end the MCU reign maybe.Part 2 suffered from no Crispin Glover. He really had the great tones and mannerisms for a foil for Marty.Everyone knows at least some lines from this movie. Everyone literally. A true gem.I see local Deloreans set up to look like the car from this movie. It draws more visitors than a typical lambo. I just added the last paragraph, true as it is, to meet the character requirements of the review."

Honestly all the actions in this movie can be short films they're so entertaining! #2 the score, Alan Silversti is a musical prodigy, every theme suits the moment and character, my favorite is Marty's letter it's so beautiful it has so much heart and emotion. #3 the development. The development in the characters is amazing, everyone gets a moment to shine, my favorite is George McFlys because he finally grew a pair and stood up to biff in a badass way. #4 set up and pay off. Set up and pay off is a very common thing to find in a script but for whatever reason not a lot of them use them, but THIS movie REALLY knows how to use it, Every single character or something in the background gets a time to shine, even things you won't even think about!

10.04.2024,9.0,"I just watched Back to the Future (1985), a sci-fi comedy in which a teenager called Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is transported to 1955 by a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his scientist buddy Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd).The movie is an excellent blend of humor and action. Marty's 80s fashion clash with 50s style is funny, as are his attempts to fit in. The unexpected bond Marty has with his parents is at the center of the story. He views them in a completely new light, recognizing that they weren't always boring grownups.Back to the Future isn't all fun and games. It cleverly delves into issues of family, destiny, and the strength of friendship. The special effects, while not mind blowing by today's standards, but it hold up surprisingly well and perfectly capture the magic of time travel. This movie is a timeless classic. It's a crowd-pleaser with something for everyone action, laughs, and a touch of heartwarming sentimentality."
07.04.2024,9.0,"Who else could have played these characters? Each character was perfectly cast, acted and memorably written. Equally memorable is the timeless story, exciting pacing, comedy and music. The only real problem is why Doc and Marty are friends. They make a great team, but have nothing in common. Marty doesn't want to be a scientist and Doc Brown isn't a musician or was one. How did they meet? I also don't know why Doc set the clocks 25 minutes slow. He didn't know Marty was coming over. In fact, one of the clocks on the ground by the plutonium case is still correct time. The DeLorean time machine is still cool and so is the rest."
29.03.2024,10.0,"Just kidding! It is one of the best films ever made. Lea Thompson was so hot. I would ""park"" with her anyday of the week, and twice on Sundays. Doc Brown is hypocritical about knowing too much about one's own future. It is weird that Marty McFly (presumably a minor in high school) is friends with a single old man scientist. Crispin Glover is probably the best part of the movie. That dude is ultra strange! I want to see the Eric Stolz version of the film. He apparently was Marty originally and filmed a lot of the movie before he was replaced by poor Parkinson poster-boy Michael J. Fox. Truly sad what happened to Fox in real life. He was a rising star and could have done a lot more with his career. But, such is life. 88 miles per hour!"

And at the last moment, they reveal this time loop as if it were a big thing and expect us to be amazed at their intelligence.I know it doesn't come close to being scientifically logical or perfect. But by using time travel as a tool, it tells a story with heart, about friendship, family, love, courage, and adding great comedy elements. All the acting is very successful. Especially Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd perform phenomenal performances while making you feel the friendship between the young man and the mad scientist that will warm your heart."

It cleverly intertwines elements of adventure, comedy, and drama, showcasing the journey of Marty McFly, who is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean created by his eccentric friend, Dr. Emmett Brown. While the concept of time travel was brilliantly executed, offering a fresh take on the genre, some aspects, like the exaggerated confrontation with the Libyans, felt overly dramatized and slightly disconnected from the storyline. Despite a few narrative discrepancies, the film remains an entertaining experience, rich in creativity and filled with memorable moments that have stood the test of time.

07.01.2024,8.0,"I recently enjoyed watching the iconic film Back to the Future, and it was nothing short of amazing. The storyline was captivating, with every scene building up the tension and making me want to know what happens next. The characters were incredibly well-developed, and their unique personalities and quirks made them all the more relatable and memorable.One of the things that stood out to me was the attention to detail in the time-travel aspect of the movie. Seeing how the filmmakers managed to weave in all the little details and make it all seem believable was awe-inspiring. The result was an engaging and entertaining movie that kept me on the edge of my seat.I particularly loved the chemistry between the characters and the humor sprinkled throughout the film. Michael J.

03.01.2024,,"In the 1980s, an experiment by a weird scientist turns out to be faulty. It leads to his teenaged pal going back in time to the 1950s where he is forced to reunite the younger version of his parents. The movie is, for better and sometimes for worse, a rich, fascinating document of the era that produced it. President Reagan was famously a huge fan, and not just because we see one of his films - ""Cattle Queen of Montana,"" the 1954 Western in which he starred opposite Barbara Stanwyck - being advertised on a 1955 Hill Valley theater marquee. With its extended flashback to the '50s from the vantage of the '80s, ""Back to the Future"" taps into the very ethos of the Reagan presidency, or part of it anyway: a spirit of pioneering technological advancement married to a wellspring of nostalgia for ostensibly simpler times."
01.01.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is an undisputed classic of cinema and science fiction as a whole. The film still works as an entertaining work, however, that doesn't mean it isn't a product of its time. The way the narrative is executed, the comedy is inserted and even how the visuals are displayed is, without a shadow of a doubt, dated. Does this mean that the work is bad seen through today's eyes? No. The work well portrays its time and the vision of the future that society had. Everything here is a huge reflection of the 80s. Even so, the work doesn't become any less thought-provoking and fun. Every film will always be dated when seen decades later, but that doesn't make it bad.The film, from the beginning, tells the viewer, in an indirect way, what will happen at the end of this story. This is one of the strong points of this film. Back to the Future thinks about many details to make the story round, even if the script falls into problems presented in works that explore time travel. The most important detail of the narrative is exactly how everything is extremely connected. All the scenes presented during the film are important for the development of the narrative and show importance again throughout it. Small details shown in small scenes always return to close the story in a satisfactory way and still leave a hook for a continuation.During many moments the small details presented are not said by the characters, but shown by small images in the foreground. The film takes advantage of small occasions to develop the narrative for the viewer, even though these details often don't seem important at first. Some scenes perfectly demonstrate the differences between the past and future using only the scenery and signs.Back to the Future is a brilliant work that marked its time and is still remembered today as a great classic. The film is extremely fun and its comedic moments are wonderful. The experience of watching this film is unique and becomes even more special when reviewed."

31.12.2023,10.0,"Back to the Future is directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film portrays Marty McFly, a high school student who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955, inadvertently disrupting his parents' first meeting and attracting his mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by rekindling his parents' romance and with the help of his eccentric inventor friend Doc Brown return to 1985.This movie is a phenomenal film. The music is fantastic. I love the song ""The Power of Love."" I love the storyline, the acting is fantastic, the comedy, and I love Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly. I love this movie so much."
20.12.2023,8.0,"Hey those days, hey..
I watched the movie, which is the same age as me, years ago, and I know that I loved it as far as I vaguely remember. It is one of the immortal works that leaves an entertaining taste in our subconscious whenever it is mentioned, just like Kemal Sunal's movies. Years later, yesterday, as a middle-aged person with children, I was at the market with my children. We watched it as a movie as a family. I'm sure my children felt similar feelings and maybe they will make a similar comment years later. It is definitely one of those productions that never gets old even after years pass.As for the film, it is one of the cornerstone films of cinema, one of the masterpieces of the master Robert Zemeckis. It is a very high-quality film in many aspects such as the scenario, acting, locations, decors, sequences, music, and clothes. It is a great film that is far ahead of the technology of that day, the likes of which I think are difficult to film even today. A movie... Immersiveness, excitement, action is always at the highest level and the tempo never slows down... Old movies had this aspect and I think this is the biggest deficiency of today's movies..."
13.12.2023,6.0,"To be honest, most of the time I understand the reason when a particular film is very highly appreciated by audiences and critics and at the same time is not my type. In this case, however, I do not find logic. Not that the film is bad. It's funny, it's watchable, and the main characters are colorful and memorable. Somehow, though, it didn't grab me all that much. I didn't find it super funny, adventurous or surprising enough. In short, nothing new under sky. Well, yeah, but that's not how most people feel.Weird.Well, at the end of the day, the important thing is that when we take the time to do something, we enjoy it as much as possible, and I'm glad that Back to the Future (1985) achieved that multiple times. In my case - I'm not disappointed, it was an OK movie, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it unless you're a fan of a particular person involved in this project or something like that.Final score: 6/10."
13.12.2023,10.0,"Great memorable movie. I like to watch that old man over and over again and he is constantly traveling through time. But the movie should have continued and newer episodes and series were made from it, but these versions are still popular with people after years, but the newer episodes can deal with modern technology and time travel. Maybe everything will be more attractive with the replacement faces of that old man, we like the new faces more and I hope it will be seen more and more. Film music can also be interesting. Pay attention to this series and produce new episodes with new actors that travel in time but also deal with new technology. Think about it along with music."
18.11.2023,9.0,"Back To The Future' is a great movie. It has an incredible energy and remains an ""innocent"" film. The music is great, and it has a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Some might argue that the time travel aspect is not plausible, but I think that's missing the point. The movie is meant to entertain, and it does that incredibly well. However, it's not just mindless entertainment. The film cleverly touches on some interesting themes and uses some ideas from Oedipus Rex's story in a funny way.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the mad scientist is hilarious, and Michael J. Fox completely embodies the character of Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy, and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is charming, and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is a timeless classic. It's been over 23 years since it was made, and it still has yet to lose its appeal. It's unfortunate that movies like this aren't made anymore, but thankfully, we can always revisit them. That's why they're classics."
16.11.2023,10.0,"Probably one of the greatest films ever made during the 80's, still holds up today. I can't think of anyone who grew up during my time that didn't love this film. A true classic, the story was great, along with the characters, and the soundtrack. It was the perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy,action. Doc Brown (Lloyd) invents a time machine using a DeLorean, to escape some Libyan terrorists after the Doc, McFly (Fox) goes back in time to 1955, and must use the assistance of 1955 Doc Brown to get back to 1985. Doesn't get much better than this as it appeals to all ages. Followed by 2 sequels part 2 is forgettable, but part 3 just as entertaining as original. 5/5."
13.11.2023,8.0,"What a classic gem this movie is
Yesterday, today and tomorrow
So many unforgettable lines and iconic scenes
Started today the trilogy and what a start this first movie is
Of course I knew the basics of the plot and even saw some scenes previous in life but now in watching the three movies no distractions from start to finish
The characters are awesome and the concept so pure. Very well executed considering it was the mid 80s
Marty and the Doc. What a Duo what a great movie
Back to the future is a classic movie from a classic saga that will remain relevant through the history of movies and makind."
13.11.2023,10.0,"Back to the future has fantastic characters and enjoyable story telling couldn't be better.The soundtrack is just perfect for the theme of the film. Michael J. Fox l did a spectacular job playing a relatable teenager living the dream. Christopher Lloyd's character Dr. Emmett Brown was very entertaining to watch I think he did a brilliant job with role and I believe no one could do it better.It makes me happy that 38 years later this film still hasn't lost its charm and holds a special place in people's hearts truly a timeless movie.Big thanks to Robert Zemeckis, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and the many others that made this movie possible.My favourite film till I die."
03.11.2023,8.0,"This film is a classic in its own right; Although it was not the first film to talk about time travel, it was the first to offer a lovable experience with funny characters where from various sources we obtained comic relief and at the same time the opportunity to embrace circumstances that our protagonists would experience. There are several sequences that have made history and the key for director Zemeckis is to offer, with his master pulse, a perfect form to an idea that in other hands would be mediocre. As a film it has not aged too well since we have become accustomed to the exaggeration resulting from the abundance of visual effects and the poverty of scripts that makes us more exquisite and impatient. Despite this, it is a good film in every sense."
01.11.2023,9.0,"Back to the future is a Classic movie that I've heard about for couple of times didn't really get the hype UNTIL nowThe Story is the BEST aspect of this movie the whole Back to the future idea is Very good ,Marty McFly and Doc are both amazing characters and very well written with some funny scenes here and there and there are a lot of chemistry between them which just makes this movie even more good and I want to note that the character development of those 2 are neat and well done.There are some Funny scenes here and there and I Really liked those and one of my favourite aspects of this very good movie.It has some very awkward scenes which are really interesting to see and quite laughable even though it's weird and if you see the movie you will know why there are some weird but good scenes 😆Overall SUCH an AMAZING adventure and I am looking forward to see the next one idk when but probably will see it because this movie is AMAZING! 9/10 DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!."
27.10.2023,9.0,"There are simply these films that have something magical about them. The magic of cinema - images, stories, characters that could enchant you, especially as a child. You were immersed in another world and sat in front of the TV with your mouth open. That was exactly the feeling I had when I saw ""Back To The Future"" for the first time.And the amazing thing is that I can still feel this feeling today when I watch the films.Even when the first notes of the magnificent score are heard, I get goose bumps.Immediately I am carried away into a world where I feel at ease and can forget everything around me. Hardly any other film has such an incredible charm as ""Back To The Future"" and its successors.This first film in particular is close to perfection for me. You can't tell a time travel story much better, more charming, wittier, more exciting, more intelligent than Robert Zemeckis does in this film. The plot is brilliant from beginning to end and there is not one scene that I find unnecessary or don't like.In addition, the strip offers simply incredible highlights, where you would like to rewind right away. For example, the appearance of Marty when he plays ""Johnny B. Goode"" at the ball, just fabulous. Or the skateboard scene, great.But not only the individual scenes, but in general this atmosphere, especially in the later course, when the action takes place in the 50s, is wonderful with the very beautiful backdrops. With Marty McFly and Doc Brown, of course, you have one of the most iconic movie duos of all time anyway, and with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, two outstanding actors who play it so well that they will forever be associated with these roles of a lifetime.Conclusion: Is there such a thing as the perfect film? Probably not, but ""Back To The Future"" is for me probably a strip that comes closest to it. And the best thing is that there are two more parts to follow, which are also really good and make up a totally round trilogy, which fortunately has been left as it is until today..."
24.10.2023,10.0,"Whenever I feel down and out about the present, I pop in the ol BTTF time machine, and am instantly transported to a better time, when things were only as serious as making sure the time continuum wasn't forever disrupted. Memorable characters, forever repeatable dialogue, and music that could make even Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan sing with glee! Having only first watched this one on VHS and not seeing it theaters, I can still feel that era whenever I catch this on tv. It is the encapsulated pleasures and atmosphere of all things 1980's. If only we had those hoverboards and self-lacing shoes by now...10/10."
18.10.2023,7.0,"My whole entire life I've had to hear what a masterpiece 'Back to the Future' is. Well, after 32 years I thought it's about time I finally watched it. Is it a masterpiece? No. It's a perfectly fine movie is what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.It's also a sign of the times. Similar to 'Indiana jones', people think it's a better film than what it is because 80s movies were so incredible bland. Time travel offers up a huge range of opportunities in terms of directions to go with your film. This film barely scrapes the barrel.Also the stakes never feel very high. The nature of the film is incredibly safe and so any audience member with half a brain knows exactly how everything is going to turn out.Truly great films have you on the edge of your seat. I never felt that way in this movie. I was simply along for the very safe ride.All that said, it's not a bad film. It just isn't what people think it is. 7/10."
16.10.2023,10.0,"One of the best movies I have seen, I like it a lot and every time I have time I watch it again, I really like the role that all the actors have, they give a special touch to the movie, everything is very similar to what one was actually in. Future it would be great if one day something like this could be done in real life.The roles that I like the most are the doctor, Martin and Biff, they are great at acting and they contributed a lot to this film, they gave it more essence, I think that without them the film would not be what it has been in this film for all time.I liked all 3 parts but the one I liked the most was the first because it made that introduction for what awaited us later with this great success."

12.09.2023,8.0,This is a spectacular film. A real classic in time. The storyline is terrific. I very much enjoyed watching this film. This is a great film for all viewers to watch. The cast selection is really precise and sensational.

12.09.2023,10.0,"Here in 2023 Back to the Future remains in the top 250 highest rated movies on IMDB and it is not difficult to see why. It's Great Scott, considering the technology and advancements the film industry has made since the year 1985, believe me this movie still holds its own. It is undoubtedly well written and entertaining and funny at times. Mostly bringing science fiction meets the adventurious with a dab of comedy to tiggle your taste buds.I remember as a young boy experiencing the ride in Universal Studios which only excelled my love for the films even more so. The DeLorean, i remember feeling the experience of being inside it all them years ago on the ride and let me tell you it was magical. The chemistry between the main protagonist Marty Mcfly and Doc Brown in contrast sets a tone of a father like son relationship with overwhelming love thrown in for good measure. On opposite sides of the coin yet on common ground of feeling outcast oddballs, somewhere down the timeline it just works so good. Every kids imagination is brought to life whilst every adult wonders of what they would do if given the opportunity to time travel. Back to the Future is the pinnacle of the time travelling genre in film, it invented the wheel and if it didn't it certainly took it further than ever before.Michael J. Fox is Marty McFly, there is no debate on that. I hear tellings of how they had to re-shoot scenes of Mcfly throughout the entire movie because the man they originally cast for Mcfly didn't get the character, or wasn't what they wanted. Christopher Lloyd plays the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown exquisitely conveying everything from mad scientist, to level headed thoughts of wisdom. The portrayal needless to say is spot on.Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have constructed a story for the ages that will truly stand the test of time and you will find yourself 'the audience' going Back to the future time and time again!"
08.09.2023,8.0,"Back to the Future is like the ultimate high-concept comedy adventure that takes you on a wild ride through the space-time continuum. We've got this guy Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) who's basically just trying to survive high school and keep his quirky family from turning into a bunch of losers. But then, he stumbles upon the eccentric Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who's like the love child of Einstein and a tornado. Doc's got a DeLorean, a flux capacitor, and a crazy plan to go back in time. Yeah, it's as nuts as it sounds.Marty and Doc jump in that stainless steel DeLorean and end up in the '50s, where things get... heavy. Marty has to make sure his parents fall in love or risk erasing his own existence. Talk about awkward family dynamics! But you know what's not awkward? The '80s and the '50s in a mashup and the hilarity that ensues! Marty and Doc are the ultimate odd couple, and their chemistry is electric. You just can't help but root for them, even when things get as complicated as deciphering the intricacies of alternate timelines, parallel universes, and the ever-elusive whereabouts of a misplaced almanac.But what really gets me is how this movie manages to balance sci-fi, comedy, and heart in one helluva entertaining package. You've got the classic '80s nostalgia dripping from every scene, and Marty's struggle to fit into the '50s is both hilarious and touching. The film's plot and pacing is so spot-on, and the script is full of clever time-travel paradoxes that'll make your head spin faster than the DeLorean's tires. Back to the Future takes us on a wild ride through the past, present, and future, all while serving up more laughs than 1.21 gigawatts of fun. It's got nostalgia, adventure, and that oh-so-'80s soundtrack. And let's not forget about that Johnny B. Goode guitar solo. It's a time-traveling, laugh-inducing, heart-warming adventure that'll have you shouting, ""Great Scott!"" in no time. So grab your hoverboard, put on your red puffer vest, and get ready to experience a classic that's as '80s as a Rubik's Cube and as funny as Doc Brown's hair on a windy day."
01.09.2023,10.0,"As I am familiar with Back to the Future I thought about wanting to look at it. As the film became the 30th Anniversary in 2015, the three films became a 30th Anniversary Trilogy celebrating the release of the first film which gained massive praise from critics and audience. Yes, I watched the whole trilogy in one day, believe or not, but I'm going to get these two later until I'm finished with the first film. Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back in time from 1985 to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes his mother's romantic interest. Dr. Emmett Brown aka. Doc, played by Christopher Lloyd, his friend and the inventor of the time-traveling DeLorean automobile, who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985. OK, so what people love about this film that has sense nowadays that I know this is a popular film and definitely the most popular Back to the Future film out of the trilogy. I love the story for what they've achieved with the first act where the story of the characters saying about what happened back in 1955 and when Marty is traveled in that year it goes what they usually do but not for Marty McFly 'cause he got hit by a car instead of George and now Lorraine, played by Lea Thompson, who now has the hots for him. Yeah, kinda weird while you think about it. For what I didn't know is that this film is used in pop culture such as what is ""Rick and Morty"" and that's all I know about that. I love the characters in which Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd plays along with the other actors. They both play fan favourite characters like Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is a typical teenager who accidentally went back in time in 1955 and he wants to get back in the year 1985. From what I heard that Michael J. Fox has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease which kinda sucks but he did continued work. Christopher Lloyd for many people know as an eccentric scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown aka. ""Doc"" who built the time machine made from the DeLorean and is my favourite character of the film. I bet many of you know his quotable line is ""Great Scott!"" Lea Thompson plays an innocent Lorraine McFly who falls for Marty and his mother in 1985. Crispin Glover is George McFly who is a teenager in 1955 and Marty's father in 1985. And then Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen, many people known him as the best character in franchise. His bully type really does suit the character really well and he throws in one of his catchphrases like ""What are you looking at, butthead?"", ""So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?"" and he hates being covered in manure. Also, I've heard the song ""The Power Of Love"" by Huey Lewis & The News and this is a good song. Christopher Lloyd appears in the music video as Doc Brown from the movie but what really caught me is Huey Lewis made a cameo appearance as one of the teachers. There's also a scene where Marty sings ""Johnny B. Goode"" by Chuck Berry. Yes, this song is in the 50's. In fact, Chuck was thinking about doing this song back in the mid 50's, believe it or not. You know, as much of these sci-fi movies that are popular at the time. Back to the Future is one of those movies you will have to see in the lifetime. It has great directing, fantastic writing, memorable characters, great performances and good effects. It boosted Robert Zemeckis' career up like he directed Romancing the Stone. This is one of my favourite films and my favourite sci-fi film of all time much like what others think of it when they put it in their Top 10 or many number movies. Do not miss this movie. Stay tuned for Back to the Future Part II. ""Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."""
29.08.2023,10.0,Whenever I am feeling down or sick or bored or happy or just feel like a good movie I turn to Back to the Future. It helps that this is a fairly family friendly movie that won't be too much for little ones watching. However my little thinks it's boring. Probably cuz I have made her watch it too many times to count.This is just a perfect movie in my opinion. Back in the 80's when they knew comedy didn't necessarily meant non stop fart jokes OR even that a comedy can be serious at times.The acting is top notch and has cemented Lloyd and Fox as one of my favorite acting duos of all time.Lots of action and adventure to be had can't recommend it enough.
18.08.2023,9.0,"(1985) Back To The Future
SCIENCE- FICTION/ ADVENTURE/ COMEDYCo-written and directed by Robert Zemeckis, fun science fiction adventure, and quite original any underdog can identify with centering on a chance to change the unsatisfying life one is experiencing into a better one by driving a time traveling car. Michael J Fox is perfect for the role who is unathletic and the only normal one in his family and Crispen Glover is perfect as the geeky dad, George McFly whose trying to provide the best for his family and Christopher Llyod is convincing as the kooky scientist after his likable persona he created while he was on the hit show ""Taxi""! Interesting note that the scene which involved the skateboarding scene while hanging onto the end of a vehicle doesn't really work in real life for I remembered someone once tried to mimic that stunt in real life during the time of this film's popular release and he ended up in the hospital and not functioning the same, meaning that it's one of those things that can be made possible in films but shouldn't be done in real life."
11.08.2023,10.0,"I like the Back To The Future series. They are very interesting plots to keep you wanting to watch from start to end. Not a lot of movies can do that but when you start watching Back To The Future you want to stay until it's over. You don't want to have to get up and down multi tasking. You will want to sit down and watch the movie. Maybe make some popcorn and grab a drink so it will be like you are at the theatre watching. I don't want to give away any spoilers so I won't go into detail, but Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) goes back in time and he has to be extra careful not to do anything that could alter the time line before he gets to go back to his time. Woth the watch."
07.08.2023,9.0,"It was an adventure of classic proportions Robert Zemeckis created when he combined clever time-travel writing with a wonderful mixture of 1950s Americana worship and an era-defining depiction of 1980s youth culture - a tribute to skateboards and walkmans. Amidst Michael J. Fox' youthful energy, Christopher Lloyd's in-your-face eccentricity and Crispin Glover's wonderful idiosyncrasy, Back to the Future did a magnificent job bridging the generation gap for mid-80s youngsters, whom John Hughes would claim weren't being understood by their parents in The Breakfast Club a few weeks later. In Back to the Future, it's arguably the other way around, but the end-result of Zemeckis' bridge-building is in many ways the same; an insight into the fact that being a hormonal teenager presented many of the same challenges in the 1950s as it did in the 1980s, or the 2020s, for that matter. And Back to the Future also keeps you completely, A-to-Z entertained by throwing impressive visuals and savvy antics at you from start to finish. A perfect film for parents and kids, even today."
06.08.2023,8.0,"Oh, what does one say about 'Back to the Future'? I might as well say just one word and conclude my review: CLASSIC!Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly - just a regular kid who dreams of becoming a rock star. His girlfriend is Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) and his best friend is the eccentric inventor Professor Doc (Emmett) Brown (wonderfully portrayed by Christopher Lloyd). His Mom is a bit conservative, although she doesn't mind a shot of Vodka, while his Dad is (sadly) a real loser, and has been a pushover since high school.One evening Doc shows Marty his latest invention - a time machine, built in a DeLorean. Doc obtained plutonium required for his time machine to work from Libyan terrorists, who are in pursuit of him. When Doc is shot, and Marty fears for his own life, he jumps in the DeLorean and accidentally goes back in time to 1955. Here, Marty meets his parents before they were sweethearts, and things get more than just a bit awkward for Marty when his mom falls for him!Nothing in 'Back to the Future' happens by chance. This is an incredibly well set-up movie, and the dialogue is very important, so you have to pay close attention. Everything here has a purpose, and plays a pivotal part in the movie. From the clever script to the incredible production design, great visuals and superb acting, this is one of the best fantasy adventure comedies.'Back to the Future' has a truly unique concept for its time, and certainly stood the test of time. Even by today's standards, the film still looks amazing. Off course, the fact they mostly used practical effects instead of CGI also makes a huge difference. Back when the movie came out, no doubt everyone wanted a (time-traveling) DeLorean!!I loved the way everything went wrong, and how everything fell into place again. And what a wonderful climax. This is an entertaining movie for the whole family!"
05.08.2023,10.0,"This is the film that took Michael J. Fox from television to the big screen.A 1980s teen is accidentally transported back thirty years to his parents high school days in a time machine that his inventor friend created.Marty McFly (Fox) is your typical teenager. He's friends with a local scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd)who creates a time machine out of a Delorian.Marty is accidentally transported back to 1955. With no way to get home he must track down Doc Brown to see if he can help him get Back to the Future, while trying not to interact with his future parents. Any interactions could alter the course of the future.This is a great film. One of my favorites for sure. The whole cast does a great job."
03.08.2023,10.0,"I love Back to the Future. Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time and will always be. I can rewatch this movie a hundred times and still never get bored with it.The acting is terrific overall in all the movies. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma and born for the role. Lea Thompson is beautiful and great, and Tom Wilson as the villain 'Biff' is absolutely hilarious.While having a typical 80s feel to it, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are surprisingly good without coming off as cheap. The comedy is funny and works.Will be rewatching for many many times."
02.08.2023,10.0,"To think that multiple studios denied to create this film, to it becoming one of the most loved and iconic sci-fi movies with a brilliant fan base, is bizarre. From the brilliant and inventive writing, to the great acting and performances, this film might be one of the best films.The visual effects and scenery in this film is astonishing, to the tiny details like Twin Pines mall becoming Lone Pine mall after Marty knocks down a palm tree in the past.To this day fans of the beloved franchise are still trying to decode secret timelines and easter eggs hidden in the corners of the film. I love Back to the Future."
27.07.2023,10.0,"The headline already gave it away, but to underline it properly: this is my favorite movie of all time and, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made.You have very few movies where everything comes together - this is one of this few. This movie has a great story, a great cast, well written characters, a great cinematic style and a fantastic soundtrack, including one of the best movie theme songs ever made.Do I even have to talk about the plot anymore?The tale of Marty McFly, the teenager who was accidentally sent back in time through the iconic DeLorean turned time machine, built by his friend Dr. Emmett Brown. He finds himself in his hometown, Hill Valley (what a name! There was a joke about that in the awesome BTTF game made by TellTale btw) 30 years in the past, in 1955. There, he meets his parents and accidentally prevents them from falling in love, which endangers his very own existence. Now he has to get them together while also getting back to 1985 through the help of the Doc Brown of the year 1955.It is a fairly simple premise, but the overall execution is sooo damn good that you don't really think about the simple nature of the story.I love this movie and I am so happy that Zemeckis and Gale still hold the rights to this film(s) close to their chest, because this is one of the film(s) that you really shouldn't try to remake, because it is simply impossible to top the original.10/10, would recommend."

08.07.2023,8.0,"I watched this in 2023 at the age of 21. I consider myself to have a pretty good understanding of what makes a movie great but also am listening to other opinions. I can easily understand why it's a classic, with likeable characters and a charming story. It's nothing special for me and was a bit cheesy, but yeah, it's just what happens over time. After listening to John Mulaney's joke on the movie I do have to say the premise is a bit odd and uncomfortable. Sometimes it can feel like things don't happen until the plot needs them to, but idk maybe I am being too harsh on it. People told me that it was absolutely incredible, but nah it's just a classic that's pretty feel-good and enjoyable honestly. Nothing much else."
27.06.2023,10.0,This is a great movie with amazing actors. Michael J. Fox was incredible. This is a movie about your life decisions and how it can affect your future. It has comedy and action my favorite combination. The main Character Marty is a teenager in High School and lives in a middle class neighborhood. His mother is big on family values and always tries to make it look as if she was a perfect teenager which we later find out is far from the truth. The father is a bit of a nerd and gets bullied around all of the time. It is a really great movie to watch with your family and it is one of the best movies of all time.
25.06.2023,10.0,"It was the best movie I watched as a kid. I still watch it occasionally. This is the first movie that comes to mind when I think of science fiction. The connection with all the films in the film series was the first thing that fascinated me. Most of the problems in today's movies are not present in this movie. There is no event like the ending of the movie based on a single event at the end of the movie. It is a movie that has been intertwined with many scenarios and these scenarios have been processed beautifully. The actors played well. In short, I think it's a much better movie than today's movies."
11.06.2023,7.0,"What do you say about one of the most entertaining films ever made? This movie is so beloved that I can't imagine anyone is coming to a review site to read what people think to get help deciding if they should see it or not. It's full of great characters, unique situations, and fun moments. It's packed with action and humor. Marty and the Professor are iconic roles performed wonderfully by the lead actors. Almost forty years later and BTTF is still a household name and part of our shared film culture. You see a Delorean, you think of this movie. It is endlessly satisfying to watch, and my only criticism is that there are one or two sequences that are drawn out for suspense that aren't really necessary. But that is just one guy's nitpick. Most people will find this to be a near-perfect viewing experience."

27.05.2023,8.0,"I will be judging the movie according to the date of this review. So for example: Even if the special effects are good for its time, they are above average for today. A gripping screenplay, sympathetic characters, iconic soundtrack, we can praise this movie until the morning, so I'm going to count the bad points because the rest is already very good. Even though I don't think there are too many bad things about the movie, there was one detail that caught my eye: Some of the chance events in the movie always seemed to happen in favor of our main character. I think this randomness undermines the credibility of the story, and even if it wasn't a bad thing, I wish we could have seen a scene about how Marty and Doc met (I know Bob Zemeckis explained it). I would like to thank everyone who worked on this movie for presenting us such a work of art and pay my respects."
05.05.2023,7.0,"Back to the Future follows Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), quite a fly guy indeed, that accidentally goes 30 years back in time, one-way ticket. Said accident happened the night that his friend, Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), introduced Marty his newest invention - a time machine. Now Marty, stuck in the past, is trying to figure out how he might come back to 1985, and doing so without erasing his own existence from the timeline - not an undifficult mission, I'll tell you that.Right off the bat, the film shows us one of its best aspects - the smooth flow. The movie is very well-paced, with little to no boring moments, in my opinion. Everything is entertaining, at least in some level, and scenes just fly by sometimes. I think that the Biff scene with the skateboard worked really well because of that thing exactly. Every little thing was fun there, and made the scene more fun to watch.The cinematography and score are both solid - nothing too experimental or unique, but both are very well-made and provide both memorable shots and musical moment, here and there. I think that the soundtrack itself is really fun as well - all the songs that carry hints of time travel, or the ""is it a dream?"" scene, which was definitely improved a lot due to the use of dream-related songs such as Mr. Sandman.I also like the whimsical, chaotic vibes that this film has. It gives the film more of a personality, and it makes the funny moments be much more potent and effortlessly good. Yeah, some time travel gags get a little tiresome, especially all the one liners about how Marty came from the future etc. (some are iconic, some are just a little cringe), but I'd still say that this movie does a good job when it comes to being chaotic in a funny, captivating way.Also, this movie is about how one needs to dare, to take a certain risk, in order to achieve true happiness. It's a cute message and it's delivered well. It doesn't blow me away, obviously, but it's woven into the film in many ways, and I feel like the movie really managed to make it the core, the heart of everything. I definitely appreciate that.There isn't a lot to say about this one - it's whimsical, simple and pretty fun to watch. It has many iconic lines, and the film just flows in a really satisfying way. The message of this film is present everywhere throughout it, and I can really appreciate the decent attention to detail there. Feeling a 7.2/10 on this one."
05.05.2023,10.0,"""Back To The Future"" is a fun and exciting movie that appeals to many people, even decades after it is release.This movie perfectly balances its comedic moments with an interesting plot, that kept me engaged and laughing throughout. The movie is really vibrant and completely captures the 80s feel.The story follows a teenager named Marty McFly, trying to return to his own time, while fixing the mistakes he has made when first arriving at 1955. McFly's hilarious and desperate attempts at trying to keep himself from being erased from existence led to many enjoyable comedic scenes.The memorable soundtrack also enhances the movie's lively and upbeat atmosphere. Overall, this move is a must see for everyone."
30.04.2023,9.0,"You really can't beat an original concept and Back to the Future gives us so many authentic ideas and visions in the one film. I love this movie it gives you such a rush of excitement of what it is like to time travel, the implications of doing so with the imagination of wonder, happiness, fear and love. The music is upbeat and suits each scene complimenting the characters and the journey. If you're after a futuristic adventure of a young man and his crazy scientist friend racing back in time to save the world then this is A great movie for you and the whole family to sit back and watch. Especially if your after a really cool 80""s vibe."
29.04.2023,10.0,"You know it can't be true, and yet, you go along with the story, because it's acted so well. You're dragged into philosphical questions like ""What if time travel were possible?"", ""Could you correct the past?"" and you see the contradictions happening, and still you believe it because everything seems logical.It's also a nostalgic flashback to the ""golden fifties"", and many people will recognize the ever returning generation conflicts. And it makes you think about the ""butterfly effect"" in your own life, the chain of little ""unavoidable?"" accidental events that brought you to your current situation in life, and how one small different reaction can change your whole life. I've seen it at least 20 times and I still enjoy it."
18.04.2023,10.0,"I just watched ""Back to the Future"" and I have to say, it exceeded all my expectations. The concept of time travel can be a tricky one to pull off, but this film does it with ease, taking us on a wild ride through the past and present.Michael J. Fox delivers a phenomenal performance as Marty McFly, capturing both the humor and heart of the character. Christopher Lloyd is equally impressive as Doc Brown, bringing a sense of eccentricity and charm to the role.The script is brilliantly written, with clever jokes and witty one-liners that had me laughing out loud. But what really makes this movie stand out is its ability to tackle serious themes such as the importance of family, and the consequences of our actions, while still keeping the audience entertained.The film's pacing is perfect, keeping me engaged from beginning to end, and the special effects still hold up surprisingly well for a movie that was made over three decades ago.Overall, ""Back to the Future"" is a true classic that deserves all the praise it has received over the years. It's a movie that will make you laugh, tug at your heartstrings, and leave you feeling inspired. I can't recommend it enough, and I'm already looking forward to watching it again."

As a time traveler myself, I must say that this movie hits all the right notes when it comes to adventure, humor, and heart.From the moment Marty McFly steps into the DeLorean time machine, the audience is taken on a wild ride through history. The attention to detail in the different time periods, from the 1950s to the 1980s, is simply amazing. And let's not forget the incredible soundtrack that perfectly captures the spirit of each era.But what really sets Back to the Future apart is its characters. Marty McFly and Doc Brown are two of the most iconic characters in cinema history, and for good reason. Their chemistry is electric, and their friendship is the heart of the movie. And who could forget the unforgettable performances by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd? They truly bring these characters to life in a way that is both hilarious and touching.And let's not forget about the themes of the movie. Back to the Future is not just a movie about time travel; it's a movie about the importance of family, the power of perseverance, and the idea that our futures are not predetermined. It's a movie that will leave you feeling inspired and uplifted.BTTF is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. It's a movie that I would recommend to anyone, whether you're a time traveler like myself or just someone looking for a great film. So, in the words of Doc Brown himself, ""Where we're going, we don't need roads!"""
01.04.2023,10.0,"When I was younger, I used to watch this movie everytime channel 9 would replay it, now I still do the same. I love it! While not the style of film I think I would make, I'm definitely glad it is around as it is the very film that sparked my interest in the film industry. Growing up I always wanted to be like Marty McFly and learning about the history of making this film, and how Micheal J Fox almost wasn't the actor, is super fascinating. The making of the movie was an absolute sh%t show and I'm surprised they finished it. Such an iconic and nostalgic film, I'll never give up the opportunity to watch it."
27.03.2023,10.0,"I'm a 44 y/o man and I still love this film. Me and my wife probably watch it half a dozen times a year (and the other two films!). I've watched it hundreds of times, I actually wish I knew exactly how many times I have watched it. I will never get bored of it though. It still makes smile when I watch it. It still makes my heart flutter when I hear the incredible score, or when Huey Lewis's The Power of Love kicks in.It hasn't aged a day either. So many films from the 80's have aged so poorly, not BTTF. It still looks like it was made today.I often wonder if we (BTTF Superfans) would still love it so much if Eric Stoltz had kept the part of Marty. I don't think I would've done. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd made it what it was.Thank you to everyone involved in making this film. It has kept me entertained for so many hours of my life, and it will do until the day I'm gone.10/10. The best film ever made."

23.03.2023,10.0,"Back to the future is a very charming and entertaining sci-fi adventure comedy, full of likeable characters and a great concept executed right. A nice time capsule of both the 80s and the 50s. It's a sweet story showing teens romancing in different eras and ways, and it uses it's idea of going back to the past and makes solid jokes. It might not be one of the funniest comedies of all time by any mean, but it's still really enjoyable. It's a perfect mixture of science fiction and comedy making a movie that's silly, yet clever at the same time. I'm sure everybody had seen it already, but if you somehow didn't, do yourself a favour."
19.03.2023,9.0,"I honestly don't understand why the first film of this iconic trilogy rarely comes up in film discussions. Many people use the 2nd and 3rd as pop culture references but rarely this one. Either way, it is still a great story! Michael J. Fox & the rest of the cast are fantastic! It's also probably one of the few 1980s films whose special effects are still great in the unfortunately-not-cool future that God punished us to live in. Oh well, at least we have flat-screen TVs and endless movie sequels! (But no overboards??? Do better, Humanity!) Lastly, I think the musical score and sense of humor this film has are really good."
03.03.2023,10.0,"One of my favourites! This is one of the most iconic and most thrilling films ever made in history of films!Its was so classic and bound to the era and it perfectly put together, with fantastic actors and a amazing storyline!The humor is perfect for the film ans very funny!It catches a unique era, at a moment people were thinking back on the 50s.Its tge most classical sci-fy film out there!Another thing that is great, is tge fabulous music which fits soo good into the story and the story development.This is really a must-see film for many reasons and i really recommend it. Its a masterpiece!!!"
27.02.2023,10.0,"Masterpiece of cinema, very original and great history. Always it's a good time to rewatch it.I highly recommend for people who likes to think about the space-time and the occasion we livin for. The story is dynamic and kept me with high expectations. Really had a great time watching it and no matter how old you are you will enjoy it. The musical content was magnificent, I always highlight the musical quality in the plays. I enjoy a good laugh and had a great time watching it and wouldn't mind watching it many times. With the title it gave me nostalgia, laughs and I was surprised by the amount of time I spent without seeing it until I was older, for this reason do not think about it anymore and watch it immediately. I said it before and I'll say it again: masterpiece."
23.02.2023,8.0,"""Back to the future"" is a mix of science fiction and comedy. The idea of time travelling is of course science fiction, but al the confusion that it provokes forms an ideal breeding ground for comedy. Given the fact that the time travelling machine is clearly recognizable as a car and the time travelling is into the past and not the future the comedy element is dominant.The story gives a brilliant example of the paradoxes time travelling can give rise to. A boy travels into the past and arrives at the time when his future parents get engaged. However his future mother obviously prefers him above his future father. The central mission of the film thus becomes that the boy has to force a match between his future parents in order to secure his own existence.Director Robert Zemeckis uses the comic potential of this situation to the max. Or should I say screenwriter Zemeckis, because the scenario is in my opinion the strongest element of the film. This easily compensates for the fact that with respect to some characters there is some overacting (the father is a little bit too goody-goody and the professor is a little bit too absentminded).Despite its character as a light weighted comedy ""Back to the future"" perfectly illustrates a philosophical problem with time travelling. When you travel to the past, you become an actor in this past. Because you become an actor in the past, you influences the past (The boy succeeds in matchmaking his future parents, but they do meet each other in a different way than without his interference). As you influence the past, you influence the future. So you can never return to the same future you came from!The film was made in the eighties and portrays the fifties. For spectators watching the movie at the time of release the fifties were the past and the eigthies their current time. Watching the movie in 2023 you are looking at two different pasts and also the ""current scenes"" in the movie look outdated. The first quarter reminded me very much of another typical eigthies movie as ""The breakfast club"" (1985, John Hughes).In some other reviews I read that ""Back to the future"" was a component of the optimistic Reagan era. I doubt it. Because the film is partly situated in 1955 and partly in 1985 you not only see the characters in these two different periods, but also the (fictional) city of Hill Valley. Some changes in Hill Valley are positive (a black waiter in 1955 has become the mayor of the city in 1985), but others are negative (a regular cinema in 1955 has become a porn cinema in 1985)."
14.02.2023,9.0,"""Back to the Future"" is a beloved classic that has stood the test of time, thanks to its expertly crafted storytelling, charming characters, and thrilling time-travel adventure. The film is widely praised for its clever screenplay, which expertly weaves together humour, romance, and science fiction to create a truly engaging and entertaining experience. Michael J. Fox's performance as Marty McFly is universally celebrated, and his chemistry with Christopher Lloyd's eccentric Doc Brown is one of the film's many highlights. The film's iconic soundtrack and stunning visual effects also contribute to its enduring popularity. Overall, ""Back to the Future"" is a must-see film that continues to captivate audiences of all ages, and its place as a cinematic classic is well-deserved."
13.02.2023,10.0,"Back to the Future is a timeless adventure that holds a special place in the heart of myself and many others. The film's mix of humor, action, and sci-fi created a unique and entertaining experience that still holds up today. The special effects, especially including the use of good old-fashioned practical effects, are still impressive and the soundtrack also plays an integral part of what I think makes the film so charming. The eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown, played by the brilliant Christopher Lloyd, is the standout character for me and really adds to the film's overall appeal, however Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is also great.In conclusion then, I would say Back to the Future is a must-see film for fans of sci-fi and action-adventure flicks, as well as anyone who loves a good time-travel story. The film's timeless appeal and memorable characters make it an absolute classic in my opinion which is why I've rated it a 9 out of 10."
08.02.2023,8.0,"Fond memories of this film. It was one of those films (back in the day) that actually had a begining, a middle and an ending . Probably because it wasn't written by a committee.One of those fabulous films (so rare these days) that not only has a story but is appealing to the entire family (without swearing, gratuitous violence or terrible CGI ) and then went on to make further sequels that were as goodWhat can I say. If you like time trave, feel good films with a happy ending - this is for you (and the sequels)You can watch this multiple times (i bought the box set) and can put this on for a nice sunday matinee film (remember them?)"
05.02.2023,10.0,"I love this movie. It's a classic. I enjoyed ALL the performances, but I really have to give props to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale - who wrote a script so spectacular, that it has stood the test of time and passed that test. The script had been rejected dozens of times, but the studios had no idea what they were missing out on - because it was a GENIUS script. I LOVE it. As we all know, this sci-fi classic, follows Marty McFly, who is thrown back into the '50s due to a time machine made by his elderly friend Doc Brown. The machine is made from a DeLorean. Marty meets his teenaged parents, and makes his mom fall in love with him, causing him and his siblings to begin disappearing - he must have his parents fall in love and return home."
03.02.2023,10.0,"Back to the future is the ultimate 1989's movie, if you're feeling nostalgic, or simply want to experience the flavour of the decade, then this is the movie for you.A young Michael J Fox is sent back to 1955 by his friend, Dr Emmett Brown, his very existence threatens his own future, he has to fight for life as he knows it.It's super fast paced, it's one of those movies that simply flies by, it's fully of action, full of laughs, it's very much the 80's poking fun at the 50's, the free and carefree lifestyle of 1985 showing how things have changed in three decades.Wonderful special effects, lots of pyrotechnics and action sequences to enjoy. The music is wonderful, you'll be singing along.The acting is superb, Michael J Fox is just great as Marty, Christopher Lloyd is awesome as the wild eyed Doc.I would say it's the perfect Boxing Day film, but it's one of those awesome movies that you'll enjoy any time, and with the whole family.A fabulous movie.10/10."
01.02.2023,7.0,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? And Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox."
01.02.2023,1.0,"This sci-fi would have been perfect if the tacky swearing didn't exist. I despise strong language in films, songs, and tv shows which is why I regularly don't watch them. Although, Back To The Future has an excellent plot and originality. I still think it could be more enjoyable without foul language in every scene! I have only seen it one and a half times in my life for those reasons. It be a lot more times for me if it didn't blurt obscene words in every scene. It's just too inappropriate. What's wrong with those writers anyway? I can tell they don't care about what they put in those scripts."
23.01.2023,6.0,"Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd give their best performances in this understated sci-fi comedy about travelling in time. The music by Alan Silvestri is stirring, and the special effects are not bad, considering the age of the film. The story is a bit hackneyed, but we forgive the plot because the characters are entertaining. The ridiculous situations cooked up by the writers work in some instances, and not in others; it is a bit uneven. Fox always had an infectious sense of humor on film, and it was a tragedy he had to retire prematurely from comedy. You may remember Lloyd from his role on the TV comedy Taxi, which also starred other major stars such as Danny Davito and Judd Hirsch."
06.01.2023,10.0,"The movie Back To The Future (1985) is one of my all-time favorites. The film never fails to bring a smile to your face whether you watch it for the 1st time or the 45th time. With humor for all ages and a kick-ass car to boot, what's not to love? Do you have a young heart?You'll laugh even though you know what's going to happen next with Marty's ""Johnny B Goode"" and Doc's ""Run For It Marty!"" The weed overcomes the bully, the dreams come true, all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a nickel ""Save The Clock Tower!""Even though it got decreasingly good in terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best in my repertoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.Featuring comedy, fantasy, Lea Thompson's stunning beauty, Doc's crazy but comical antics, and Marty's typical teenage antics, this movie gets a solid 9 out of 10."
04.01.2023,9.0,"Back to the Future is a delightful and timeless classic that continues to entertain audiences of all ages. The movie's clever script, engaging performances, and iconic imagery all come together to create a truly memorable and enjoyable film. The story follows Marty McFly, a likable and relatable protagonist, as he travels back in time and encounters his teenage parents in 1955. Alongside his eccentric inventor friend, Doc Brown, Marty must navigate the challenges of time travel and ensure that his younger self returns home safely. The movie is full of memorable moments, from the iconic DeLorean car to the humorous and heartwarming interactions between the characters. Whether you're watching it for the first time or revisiting it as an old favorite, Back to the Future is a movie that never fails to deliver. Highly recommended for fans of science fiction, comedy, or just great storytelling in general."
26.12.2022,10.0,"The first time I watched this movie was back in 2019. I saw it on Netflix and my dad told me how he remembered watching it in theaters back when it came out in '85 and said he loved it. This made me curious so I watched it. The whole movie just has a great story, great soundtrack, wonderful characters, is funny, and the special effects were pretty great for a 1980's movie. I can't remember the amount of times I've re-watched this movie since then, all I know more than 20 times. This movie is so memorable and made me fall in love with the BTTF trilogy. But this film, the first, will always be my favorite one. I really love Micheal J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's acting, they make the film so lively and enjoyable. Overall 10/10, I'll never get tired of this movie."
15.12.2022,8.0,"This is a movie that I realized I had never seen all the way through. I would come in after Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) was already in the past. Jaime and I decided to watch this since it was lighthearted and on the Internet Movie Database poster that we're working through as well. What I didn't realize until sitting down to view this was that Steven Spielberg produced, directed by Robert Zemeckis and Dean Cundey being the director of photography.For this, Marty lives with his parents Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover). He pals around with Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). It is through him that Marty ends up back to the day where his parents were supposed to meet. He gets in the middle by accident and disrupts that. He must set things right before returning to the present, even if he can return. Encountering Dr. Brown to help along with encountering Biff Tannen (Tom Wilson) and his group of cronies.What I will say is that this is better than I was expecting. I've heard people say this is their favorite movie. The writing is on point. There were little things that I noticed early on that come into play later. We also just get subtle things that if you aren't paying attention, you'll miss. I think that the acting is good as well, that helps. Fox is just on point and he is just Marty to me. His quirky nature fits so well. Lloyd is also great as Dr. Brown. He brings so much to his role as well. Other than that, Thompson, Glover, Wilson and the rest. The acting is good across the board.The rest of what I want to discuss would be with the filmmaking. I've already said how good the writing is. I think that this is shot well so credit there to the cinematography. Going along with that, the effects are 80s. I've seen worse though, I will say that. I'm a big fan of time travel movies even though there are plot holes that come with it. This is just a fun movie for what they do there. Other than that, I'd say the soundtrack fit for what was needed.My Rating: 8 out of 10."
12.12.2022,10.0,"""Back to the Future"" is simply a must watch classic. Peak 80s era blockbuster movie magic. It's funny, whimsical, and charming. I can't think of anyone who doesn't love this movie. The cast is all teaming with great chemistry, the writing is all superb. I love the fact that this movie has that ever-present layer of nostalgia surrounding it. Must have been nostalgic for people back in the 80s to see a ""present day"" person step back to the 50s, and it retains that nostalgia as a time capsule in the 80s moments.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are both great as the leading characters. Marty's parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) are great in supporting roles. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) is one of my favorite movie villains of all time. He gets more time to shine in ""Part II"", but here he's great as well.You owe it to yourself to watch it, and if you aren't grinning ear to ear by the time the credits roll, then you probably oughta ""make like a tree and get out of here."""
03.12.2022,10.0,"I have never expected that performance this so old movie but My mind is totally changed by the back to the future movie. It was absolute written by superior-high intelligence people besides there was more than just a scenerio. Actors played so incredible especcialy the doctor one. While i was watching i totally wondered about what did happen the next scene in the movie. The movie managed to hook me. Actually if lived in that times i would be crazy for this movie but if i say present time, we have been getting use to this future and past between them connection. For example we at met by avengers movies or something as like them. I don't want to keep long my essay. I just wanted to share my experience."
25.11.2022,8.0,"Here is a picture that makes audiences think and laugh, wonder and worry. Back to the Future is a uniquely 80s film entangled in the 1950s. Marty McFly and Doc are timeless characters that are supremely realized on screen by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Both of them are so animated and colorful with their deliveries throughout the runtime. The story is fresh and the writing is fun to the point that new viewers will be constantly asking themselves what's next. This is a film I can almost always sit down and enjoy, whether with family or even by myself. Despite its age, this movie continues to entertain."
27.10.2022,10.0,The story where a scientist breakthrough becomes an adventure and mission for a teenager. Accidentally landing in the year of Doc Browns first vision Marty finds himself in a different time.The story is very well written and the cast is cannon. The use of real science and action to keep you fueld will keep any film goer glued to this fun adventure. This film really stands the test of time and great for the family.The story doesn't warp you into an off set environment or become cartoony. It provides the right formula telling the story where it's going where it's been and where you are.A highly recommended film there's nothing negative about it.
24.10.2022,8.0,"One of the most successful films of its time perhaps it is. Blending time travel with comedy, it offers enjoyable moments to the audience. Acting Micheal J. Fox and Christoper Lloyd, this movie is a true masterpiece. No wonder it won so many awards, the acting and scripting are great.this movie contains a script and comedy ahead of its time. That's what makes it so Awesome! To summarize with slight spoilers; Back to the Future tells the story of a boy accidentally going from 1985 to 1955. Meeting his high school parents, the teenager accidentally attracts his mother's romantic interest. Since he prevented his parents from falling in love, he has to make up for his mistake and go back to 1985. If you haven't watched it yet, don't wait, open it and watch it now!"
10.10.2022,7.0,"This is a good movie about a boy who accidentally travels back in time and gives us a crazy story. This movie is rich in content, and we got to know a lot of different characters. I think the story was quite alright, and I appreciate when stories include time as a topic, which I think was well used in this one. Time travel is always interesting, and it rarely disappoints me. The story was kind of simple, but I think it was the interaction between the characters that made up for most of it. I think the actors were mostly good, but my attention goes to Crispin Glover (as George McFly). He played such a unique character, and his performance was great! This movie is definitely recommending!"
10.10.2022,9.0,"This movie is a timeless classic. You watch it anytime and you will enjoy it. Earlier I watched the movie in hindi dub and to be honest I didn't enjoy the movie that much. Today I watched the original english version and I totally enjoyed it. The story was enjoyable, the performances were also enjoyable and the ending was also left at cliffhanger which I thought was a smart move. Now, I am excited to watch the sequels which I haven't watched yet.Overall, it was a good movie which I would recommend to everyone. This movie can't be remade again and I respect the director when he said he will not allow anyone to make the remake."
05.10.2022,10.0,"This is one of the most perfect films ever. It's a masterpiece that has left its mark on pop culture - and for good reason. It's a classic-feeling film, with great acting, great shots and cinematography, and it's one of the best-plotted films ever. It's a film that doesn't have any major story flaws, almost all of the characters are memorable, and every actor gives their A-Game. So, on re-watch... It's a film I could never get tired of, and it's a great film on your 1sy watch, 10th, or 100th. It doesn't lose it's magic, and sometimes it's even better on re-watch... Noticing new details, knowing what had gone in behind the scenes, and seeing it in the film. It's a great film that's perfect to just throw on at any time, and it's always a great time to re-watch it!"
26.09.2022,10.0,"Everything about this film screams iconic. To the soundtrack to the wardrobe to the set design. The continuity itself is a cinephile's greatest discovery. How Robert Zemeckis did it, is phenomenal. Back to the Future sits high on my list as one of the best science-fiction romantic comedies of the 80s. It inspired me to become a director myself. Almost a decade after watching it, nothing else can compare.You won't be disappointed. Its heart-warming story will bring laughter and joy to your family movie night. Don't forget the popcorn and drinks because you will not want to pause it. I should warn you now, get the second and third movie. I spent one night watching the trilogy and I was highly impressed. I didn't get tired once. The plot twists kept me awake as I wanted to know what happened to Marty McFly, the main character.If you thought you had nothing in common with an 80s character, you'd be mistaken. McFly is just like you, and I. Everything goes wrong for him. But who's there to help him? His mentor and friend, Doc. We all have a Doc in our lives that we all know and love, and secretly worry for. A friend who lives on the edge. Every day is a new adventure for Marty and Doc. Whether it's scientific experiments to getting into trouble to traveling through time. Back to the Future is a movie you don't want to end. Because you're having too much fun.This movie makes you think. Not about girls, or boys. Nor romance or popularity. Back to the Future makes you think about family, friends, and the importance of our choices. To Marty, it's more important to be different than to fit in. He rather go against the status quo than to change himself to fit the past. In a world where people are bullied for being outsiders, this film teaches us to fight for our self-worth. Our value does not come from someone's opinion. It comes from within. Without self-love or self-value, there would be no you.The choices we make as individuals causes a chain reaction. What we do today has a direct impact on tomorrow, or the years to come. With actions there are consequences, and Back to the Future does a wonderful job in advising people to look closely at their actions and how it may affect them and those around them.This is not just a movie, I realized. It is a gift - from the past. A digital creation that offers advice and wisdom on how to live. As Marty McFly discovers adulthood, beside him we can learn from his mistakes and use his life lessons as our own. Whether it's through dating, going to school, being a son, being a friend, to being a hero. You will go to the past with Marty and Doc, and unlike our main character, you will never want to go back.So maybe you're just like Marty McFly - A slacker. An outcast. A rebel.Or you're just like Doc - An optimist. A creator. A visionary.If you're as lucky as I am, you're all the above.Great Scott, get in the DeLorean and buckle up. This ride was made for adults and children of all ages everywhere. What are you waiting for? Add it to your list of must watch. Huge thank you to Robert Zemeckis and the creators for changing my life. I know it will change yours!!!Similar Movies: Jurassic Park, Men in Black, Inception, E. T., Indiana Jones, Groundhog Day, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club."
25.09.2022,10.0,"This movie is an absolute classic and it still stands as my fave to this day... This time travelling masterpeice is great for the whole family and perfect for a movie night. This movie is followed by 2 others which are equally as good. If you love the 80's like I do, love a bit of action and drama then this movie is perfect for you. If you haven't already seen this movie, do yourself a favour. Micheal J Fox is the star in this movie and his acting is absolutely incredible. He has become one of my all time favourite actors because of this film. And just remeber lighting never strikes twice....."
22.09.2022,10.0,"I really loved this movie, one of my favorite ones of all time. I have seen it multiple times and probably will watch it again. I think it was a really funny movie and ahead of it's time. I have seen all of the sequals as well. As I was not born when it came out and as I am waching it in this century, I think it was really interesting to see what they thought the future would look like and what actually came true. I think that the whole idea about the movie was genius and made you think abouy your live and how would it be if just few small things changed, so you have to be gratefull for what you have."
11.09.2022,10.0,"Time travel is the most illogical and, at the same time, a truly inexhaustible and incredibly fascinating topic, a bottomless barrel of plots for fantastic cinema. ""Back to the Future"" is one of the best science fiction films in the history of cinema, shot on this topic, a real cult of the genre.However, it is almost impossible to determine the genre of this picture. This is, perhaps, the standard of how to make a film, the plot of which is based on so many genres: comedy, fantasy, drama, adventure, and even a thriller! The element of each genre is carefully calibrated here and fits very harmoniously into the overall style of the picture.""Back to the Future"" is a film that is subtle, smart, deep, incredibly thoughtful and, at the same time, very light, bright and stylish. Only Zemeckis could show, in such an easy and elegant form, essentially very serious things: the lack of mutual understanding between parents and children, problems in the family, the formation of character and the desire to change one's life for the better and make a decisive choice - to be weak all the time, no matter what. Not capable, a whiner and break down under the blows of fate or proudly stand up to his full height, overcome fear in himself, overcome himself and give back to his offender. ""Your future is not written anywhere - it is what you make it!"" - the key thought that runs like a rod through the whole trilogy.A wonderful plot, a magnificent script thought out to the smallest detail, absolutely deservedly nominated for an Oscar, excellent directing and very high-quality technical performance complete the picture. Cinematography, editing, sound, visual effects - everything is done superbly. And, of course, it should be noted the legendary and recognizable from the first notes of the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, which fits perfectly into the visuals of the picture and the brilliant acting.Michael J. Fox is the perfect Marty. Nimble, charming, resourceful, cheerful guy with a sparkle in his eyes and a great sense of humor, always able to stand up for himself, despite his small stature and Doc Brown performed by Christopher Lloyd is no less charming professor, very humorous, a little silly and eccentric. Together they form an incredibly funny and touching tandem and cause real delight.The rest of the actors are not far behind - they all played wonderfully, very organically fitting into the plot. There is not a single ""sagging"" frame and not a single superfluous character in the film - each character, even the most insignificant, is verified and thought out to the smallest detail. By the way, it's funny that in the trilogy the then very young Billy Zane, Casey Semashko and the very young Edijah Wood ""lit up"".""Back to the Future"" is a film for all times, for any age and any audience. It will never lose its relevance and magical, magical appeal. This is a journey into childhood, to breathtaking adventures and journeys that so excite the imagination. This film can be reviewed an infinite number of times - and each time you experience indescribable delight, experiencing adventures with the heroes of the picture. This film will make a great addition to any collection. A timeless masterpiece. Classic."

Or I'm not not liking it, or a combo, but for whatever reason, I'm always ready to turn it off. In that last 20 minutes give or take.Other than that, and overall I love the movie. 8.5 Gigawatts for me.WTH is a Gigawatt?!"
19.08.2022,10.0,"Back to the Future stays a true classic and holds up so well 37 years later. Fox is just incredible in the role. The story is solid and the whole execution almost flawless. And of course you have the music, the cinematography and all the other technical elements very well executed."

10.08.2022,1.0,"This is a fraud movie, the most effective one I know of; everyone in the '80s liked it. Spielberg said the ""studios weren't ready for Bob's movies, even though he was ready to make them"" or something (it's on Zemeckis's Wikipedia page), but really, I think this was a question of the Spielbergian élan that he can't confer to others but imagines (might be) there ... of all the follow-ups and rip-offs to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' the Lucas Star Wars films, 'E. T.,' 'Close Encounters,' and 'Jaws', it's this one that sticks ... not ""Young Sherlock Holmes,"" ""Tales of the Gold Monkey,"" ""King Solomon's Mines,"" ""Battle Beyond the Stars,"" or Spielberg's own ""Amazing Stories"" and ""Twilight Zone"" revivals (I'm omitting ""Gremlins,"" but Joe Dante has a vision and style of his own, so bear with me). Zemeckis, later to give us ""Forrest Gump"" and having already given us ""Used Cars"" (not a hit, but considered a cult classic, and subversive) and ""Romancing the Stone"" (funnily enough, one of the biggest hits of the year and everyone was fond of it at the time, though it sticks in no-one's craw *now*; Kathleen Turner had trouble finding movie roles after 'Body Heat,' no-one wanted a husky-voiced Bacall like they wanted a sarcastic Jack Nicholson in Christian Slater, makes have it easier!), once said ""he never saw why people disparaged TV so much ... I learned a *lot* from TV!"" or something. (Which is where we get ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" which holds up badly now -- or at least weakly, like water dripping through a sieve. It's not just who cares about these characters now -- or, not to be unkind, but Bob Hoskins either, but let's get real -- but who cares about these *pretenses* now? WB cartoons may come up in ""The Shining"" but that's about it. I used to watch Saturday morning cartoons every week until I grew out of them, but I'm as little fond of them even as a memory as I am of sugar-coated breakfast cereals, which was supposed to make up for eggs and bacon, much less the breakfast scrambled everyone eats in Portland, where I live, now. I used to be Boba Fett and Yoda for Halloween, get me? Who *cares* about Saturday Morning Cartoons -- at least I *remember* those costumes, those experiences, etc.) Which -- the TV-watching I mean -- makes him like David Mamet. ""I grew up during the golden age of television!"" he says, or something close to it (I'm quoting from memory), in his relatively-recent book about realizing he's a ""conservative."" And David Mamet was considered one of the pre-eminent playwrights of our time, certainly when I was in college in the early '90s and Madonna's choosing to do ""Speed the Plow"" on Broadway was supposed to be significant and ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" was being made into an all-male, ""Reservoir Dogs""-like allstar combatant zone by the Jim Thompson adapter, ""After Dark, My Sweet's"" James Foley (still the only Mamet, aside from ""House of Games,"" worth seeing, and at that, only once -- who cares about ""Heist?"" He's too full of himself). Talk about high and low culture! All of a sudden it looks like we're being duped, because we're too shy to construct our own narratives, and can't tell people confident enough to string scenes together with sugary-coated TV motives and direct them into life from ""Love's Labor Lost."" I say phooey on this movie. All it teaches is contempt -- and you can tell this from the reviews on here, they're all replete with it. Crispin Glover was much better (and *memorable*!) in ""Wild at Heart"" (""I'm making my lunch!""). Who could forget *that*?"
10.08.2022,8.0,It was a good movie with interesting plot. There was a few plot holes that is normal in this type of time travel movies so it's okey. The characters are fun and it reminded us Rick And Morty.
27.07.2022,10.0,"Every damn time.Every single goddamn time I watch this film I want to skateboard, and I want to be able to play guitar much better than I can, and I want to beat up the school bully...basically I just wanted to be Marty McFly.And I have done ever since I was 11 when I first watched this, because he really is just the perfect protagonist. He has a relatable struggle with wanting to be successful, his story has high stakes, he's extremely likable and funny...just about the only thing you could complain about is the often recognised fact that he doesn't really have an arc of any sort.But (at least for me) it's really not needed because of everything he does mentioned above, plus the fact that no one could have played him any better than Michael J. Fox, who delivers what is honestly one of my favourite performances ever in this film, and the fact that he very nearly couldn't be part of the film at all is terrifying. There's some other universe that has Eric Stoltz as Marty instead, and no hate to Eric, but that's not a universe I want to live in.But for as much as I could bang on about Michael J. Fox in this, all the other major actors are just as fantastic. Every single one of them played one of the best examples of their respective archetype in cinema: Christopher Lloyd gave us one of the most memorable and funniest mad scientists ever, Crispin Glover must have forever damaged his social standing by playing one of the biggest dorks ever captured on film to perfection, Lea Thompson never fails to convince you that she is an utterly infatuated girl (and an alcoholic at the beginning), and Thomas F. Wilson as Biff is my single favourite bully in cinematic history. What an ass.Coming back to this after it had been a few years since I last saw it, however, it really struck me just how funny this film is. I remembered there being a few jokes, sure, but this really is a straight-up comedy, and everyone of the aforementioned actors aside from Michael J. Fox is hamming it up massively. But it works because Marty is the everyman thrown into a wacky situation unimaginable to anyone watching, so every other character being so over the top works perfectly for the tone.None of them could have been so funny without a great script though, and as far as I'm concerned this film has one of the best ever written. There's brilliant foreshadowing, set ups and payoffs, the plot is imaginative, it's paced flawlessly, and the dialogue is absolutely gorgeous. Trust me, another thing I do everytime I watch this is I end up quoting it for weeks afterward.This has also got to be Robert Zemeckis' best directing by far - so many memorable images, the production design is great, especially with how good it is at making you believe you're looking at a 50's version of a town, and there isn't a single editing flub.And good lord that main theme. Need I say more?You can argue that there's a few minor plot holes here and there, and admittedly in some ways it is a little problematic today, but none of that really bugs me because of just how damn good this screenplay is overall, and I really couldn't think of anything else to moan about.So yeah, Back To The Future was in some ways already a classic in 1985, it was a classic in 2015, it'll undoubtedly still be a classic in 2045 and beyond, and if you haven't seen it...get on that. You've only got so much time."
18.07.2022,9.0,"""Wait a minute. Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?""If you got anything that has to do with time, space, paradox hypotheses; well, just count me in. My fascination with these subjects knows no bounds yet regrettably I have never taken the time to experience one of the most touted classics ever proposed on time travel. Believe it or not, this was my first ever viewing and I was thoroughly entertained!Even if there are not many dialogues going on about the core concept; I still happened to enjoy my time with the film, probably more than I anticipated. It was not a laughter ride nor did it wish to become exceptionally passionate about the topic at hand; it just wanted to serve you a delightful plate full of entertainment and light-hearted fun and I think it was successful in doing that. I had a big smile on my face for the totality of this film!"
14.07.2022,9.0,"Robert Zemeckis' film ""Back to the Future"" marks the beginning of an amazing story of two friends: a little mad scientist and a young guy who comprehend the science of time travel and find themselves involved in the most interesting adventures. Once this movie made a splash, winning an Oscar. To this day, this movie becomes an excellent companion for the whole family when watching together.Having seen the film for the first time at a young age, you involuntarily begin to take an example from the young Marty McFly. By the way, he is played by a talented actor Michael J. Fox. The hero is ambiguous. He is absolutely positive, but bold, ready to help a friend, stand up for his ideas. In addition, you need to have an excellent nervous system, being in a different time among those people you almost don't know. Michael's character copes with this perfectly, simultaneously forcing the audience to smile and empathize. Fox was very pleased with the work.Dr. Brown initially appears to the audience as a dorky scientist who is not completely connected with science, but later you realize that the world around you simply does not know what he knows. Christopher Lloyd, in my opinion, makes half of this film, although he seems to have a second role in the movie. He is purposeful, assertive and hungry for new discoveries in science.And this couple is working smartly in a duet, trying to correct their own mistake. Thompson, Glover and Wilson are also charismatic. Their heroes perfectly convey the era of the 50s, a kind of youth who has already forgotten the war, has grown up and is preparing to step into adulthood.The film has a wonderful soundtrack that makes you feel the era, the atmosphere, literally visit in 1955, understand how wild it looked for a teenager from 1985.Viewers will appreciate a variety of references to popular culture, especially Darth Vader of the 1955 model is remembered. The movie is wonderful. It is suitable for any age, will make you laugh and empathize, discuss actions. Isn't this the true goal of cinema?9 out of 10."

And this film give us a dream it's would be like to do so. Great ever classic film I I keep coming back and watch again and again, I lost count of how many time I had watch it."
24.06.2022,10.0,It's a total masterpiece. Best time travel movie ever made. Great si-fi and comedy package it was. I really enjoy the every part of this movie. Loved it very very very much.
24.06.2022,9.0,"Can anything that hasn't been said yet be said about this movie? I'm at the start of watching this trilogy which I have never actually sat down to watch until now. Only having seeing memes, references and some famous clips.This is just a perfectly executed movie really, great characters, attentive viewers are rewarded with future in movie references constantly. Character arcs are solid. It's checked all the boxes. But goes beyond that.Directing is fantastic, Zemeckis and Spielberg showing their best. From the long take intro that rhymes with the movie and tells everything we need to know about Doc, to the euphoric moments of time travel.It's hard to judge music as of now as it has become so iconic for the trilogy, it's really good. Sound design too for the car but I can't unhear the sound of a X-Wing unfolding when the car jumps, that has to be the same right?!Anyways, it's such a satisfying story. But the time travel aspect makes it really hard to look much deeper than surface level. You simply cannot think about the butterfly effect here because the movie doesn't either. Also the final scene still wrecks my brain, isn't that second Marty going to repeat what the first Marty did? And so end up in a infinite loop or something? But I know this is not the type of movie that dives into something like that.Curious to see the next two in the trilogy, the ending here was hilarious. LLoyd gives a incredible performance. Coincidentally I just discovered he played Judge Doom in Who Framed Roger Rabbit and you wouldn't have guessed those were the same two people. J. Fox does great too with that quirky-ness that makes him so enjoyable to watch...but what's up with that sleeping pose!? He looks like he's broken his arms, it was funny, but also so weird. Also I loved Glover in this, saw him for the first time in a F13 movie with his crazy dance act, here he plays a similar wacky character and owns it.Looking forward the the next two."
23.06.2022,10.0,"Great film! If you've ever wondered what the future would be like as a kid, this film does a great job at foreseeing what the future might be like. That being said, it's a film that one would love to still continue watching even today because the future in the movie is nothing like what we expect in reality. Nonetheless, it's a fun film with lying vehicles, cool inventions and so much more. It's highly recommended."
20.06.2022,10.0,"I wish they still made movies like this . It had what most movies lack today. DRIVE ! 🚗 . When rewatching this movie at an older age you feel that rustic , American free will society.Ronald Ragan."
18.06.2022,10.0,I am a big fan of the original Back to the Future movie because it's a real classic. The acting is great and the storyline is amazing. The DeLorean is Beautiful and the idea behind it is great. It's nicely filmed and the script is good too. I can only recommend this movie - and the two BTTFs after it!
07.06.2022,10.0,"Iconic. A classic. Seriously, there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said. One of the greatest films of all time and one of my favorite films of all time. I don't like calling movies perfect, because there's always something, but man... this movie's perfect."
25.05.2022,8.0,I watched the movie in the night and i didn't sleep. The movie have weak script but the director did a good job for movie be good and humorous.Congratulations to all involved.
20.05.2022,10.0,"I loved watching this movie I found it very entertaining and it was also extremely funny. I hope I get to watch it on my TV again. :D Best movie I've ever seen. The actors did good acting in it. It reminds me of Rick and Morty. Great scenes as well, my friends also loves this too."
19.05.2022,10.0,I remember this set for back to the future. I also used the set for some music videos. The hoverboard was soo cool too test out as a prop before the actual film.
16.05.2022,9.0,"Some movies manage to capture a generation of audiences, to the point that, it garners much love from new audiences, throughout the decades, since its initial release in theaters. It appeals to younger people, as well as, the older crowd too. It becomes part of the pop culture landscape. These films work like a tradition to many. The list is ever-growing. It consists of titles, like the Wizard of Oz (1939), Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) and this film, Back to the Future (1985). These are films, that survive the changing of times. They are ageless. That's because they appeal to a large group of different sectors of the audiences. Most everyone can quote a line, recognize an image in the film or they have some kind of a connecting memory to the film, like a date or something. Director, Robert Zemeckis strikes gold with this one. It also is interesting and funny to note, how much of an impact Back to the Future (1985), has had on the debate about time travel. A pop-culture influence, that was energized 34 years later in Avengers: End Game (2019).As everyone knows, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), finds himself sent back in time to 1955, by his scientist buddy, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Marty enlists the aid of Doc's 1955 self to aid him in returning to the future. A hilarious, smart, adventure, fantasy film unfolds from there. Fox and Lloyd were born to be Marty and Doc. The supporting cast does an excellent job also. The trick in this film, that helps with the suspense, is the plot idea, that Marty must not do anything, that will effect the future. Of course, that is an impossible task, that makes this adventure, one of the most cherished films ever.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."
15.04.2022,10.0,"Back to the future is a great movie and in my opinion the best comedy movie of all time.The acting is great, Michael J. Fox was the perfect actor to be Marty Mcfly. He makes the character feel so real and funny.The characters are great, literally no character is bad and if your looking for the best character in movie you have it in this movie, i'm talking about Marty Mcfly the comedy the character brings is great, i love his arrogance. The plot is perfect. The cinematography is also great.They used the budget in the best way possible.Doc is one of the funniest characters of all time.This movie is referenced so many movies and Tv shows.It's a perfect movie for the whole family and i recommend it in so many ways!"
15.04.2022,10.0,"It's definitely the best one out of the trilogy. It's fun seeing how actions made in the past have a small effect on the present. For example at the very beginning of the movie you can see a sign of a mall i guess that's named ""Twin pines"", but when Marty goes back in time for the first time he destroys one of them and at the end in the present the mall is named ""Alone Pine"" and there is more, MORE of such easter eggs. The music is one of those that when you hear it you can immediately know that it's from this trillogy. If you haven't seen it already then go, watch right now. Where did you live for last 35 years if you haven't seen it? It's one of the best movies i have ever seen, 10/10."
11.04.2022,10.0,"It is a adventure film.This film is set in the year 1985 in Hill Valley California
It´s about Marty McFly and Doc, a scientist.Marty McFly, a school student gets lost in 1955 by an accident, 30 years back in a time. With the help of his friend, Doc a scientist, he is desperately trying to find his way back to the future in the year 1985.I would recommend this film Because is very funny, exciting, unbelievable, cool, interesting, captivating, amazing, exceptional, great, awesome, extraordinary, magnificent, surprising, nice, astonishing, amaze, fascinating, enjoyable, agreeable, beautiful, different from other movies, fine, excellent, exceptional, marvellous, outstanding, adventurous, curious one thousand adjectives more."
08.04.2022,8.0,"When people talk about classic scifi films, they always mention Star Wars and Back to the future! This review will be about the latter. Back in the early 80s, Robert Zemeicks was developing this film for many studios, but most of them rejected due to being childish, so when he tried to give the idea to Walt Disney studios, they weren't satisfied with the fact that Lorraine was flirting with her son from the future without even knowing. And finally, after 50 attempts at pitching the idea to every single company, Universal finally accepted and made his wish come true. And even 4 decades since it's release, people still love the movie for it's creativity and special effects. But how exactly is this movie special?The plot begins with a teenage boy Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) being a rebel who likes skateboarding, playing the guitar and being friends with a crazy scientist Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd). The doctor invents a time machine out of a delorean car and tests it out. But due to some unfortunate events, Marty finds himself in the 50s and meets his parents in their high school years. Now our protagonist has one goal in mind - to make sure that George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson) stay together as a couple and to avoid Biff (Thomas F Willson). Otherwise, he would have a big risk of being vanished. The story is well done, it's truly amazing! The whole idea of meeting your parents when they were around the same age as you definitely sounds fun, and the movie took the full advantage of it. As you may notice, neither George nor Lorraine know Marty, so they just think that he's just a student from the other state. And most characters are shocked when they hear that he's different. For example, when Lorraine's parents hear that Marty has more than 1 tv in the house and that he already saw the episode of the show. There is a lot of funny scenes in the film too. I especially laughed when Marty tried to wake up George by dressing up himself as Darth Vader and telling him that he's an alien from the planet Vulcan. I can say that the action scenes were well done as well. Like the one where our hero McFly punched Biff in the face and later on, took the box and turned it into a skateboard.Let's move on to the characters. Marty may seem like your typical high school student who doesn't take school seriously and likes to hang out and play music, but once he travels to the past, he started to be more responsible for his actions by making sure Lorraine and George fall in love with each other. He's a great protagonist with a well executed character development. Another important character is Doctor Brown, a scientist who came up with a time travel car after accidentally hitting a head by a sink, thus creating a flux capacitor. His past self tries his best to bring back our hero back to the future (hence the title), which shows us that he cares about his soon to be friends person. Biff may seem to be the typical bully who likes to make fun of others, George McFly to be more specific. But when you realize that even the smallest thing can change the future (that idea was also explored in Butterfly effect), his role increases down to the point where he can be hateable, but still nicely made as an antagonist! Finally, George and Lorraine are 2 classmates who don't even know about each other that much. The female character actually fell in love with Marty instead of George because the former was the one who nearly got hit by a car. As for the male character, he seems to be confused about everything of what's going on, especially with Marty's goals. But you still support and root for him thanks to his future son. And thanks to the performances of J Fox, Lloyd, Glover, Thompson and Wilson, these characters became interesting and enjoyable in the best way possible, and you just can't imagine someone else portraying them.Finally, we have the soundtrack and effects. The music here is energetic and fun. Especially the Johnny B good song, which was a typical 80s rock song that played during the underwater themed prom party, but it was a great song that was catchy for both old and new generations! The effects may seem dated, but they are not distracting nor cheap, and look fitting for something that came during that time. But back then, they were amazing and stood out from other movies of the similar genre.This movie needs to be seen by everyone, regardless of age or generation. Even with some outdated effects, it stood the test of time and became one of the best examples of not just scifi, but movies in general. I highly recommend this to those who enjoyed the Soviet movie Guests from the future or the 2000s film Butterfly effect. Trust me, it's worth your time!""I Guess You Guys Aren't Ready For That Yet. But Your Kids Are Gonna Love It."" - Marty McFly."
04.04.2022,10.0,This movie is something you wanted to see again and again and you will never be bored. Evert scene detailing it is very rare you could found a flaw. Its 100% recommended from my side.
03.04.2022,10.0,"I dont have any words, this is just a masterpiece of cinema, when i see this movie for the first time i love it and every time i see it is even better and better and better...."
02.04.2022,10.0,"For me, no other film captures the spirit of the 80s as well as 'Back to the Future': the coolness, the fun, the music - if you want to re-live the experience (or feel it for the first time, if you have the misfortune of having been born too late), watch Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) going back to 1955. Robert Zemeckis has created a film that is as close to perfect as anything could possibly be. I won't go into the details of acting, plot, photography etc. 'Back to the Future' is irresistable, and that's it."
30.03.2022,8.0,"In fact, I saw the film for the first time properly a few days ago, which is a shame, because I actually like such old movies very much and the film is simply cult! He has a very classic humor and films in which the mother falls in love with her son would probably no longer exist today. Rightly so, because it provided the one or other cringe moment.Due to the cult status I had very high expectations of the film, which unfortunately were not quite met, but I was not completely disappointed either. The film has wit and you fever with Marty, who tries to bring everything back in order. Like many films from these years, it has a very pleasant mood and you could fully immerse yourself in the story. Even though some elements were very predictable, you were surprised in some places. I must say that I liked the first part best. The second was also still okay, but the third would not have been necessary in my opinion.Clear recommendation to all who have not yet seen the film, because it is simply a must-watch!"
25.03.2022,9.0,"A solid movie that still holds up after more than 30 years, must be the timeless themes of Family, Love and Density I mean Destiny. Not bad for a movie that was apparently rejected over 40 times. Not raunchy enough to be a 'Risky Business', too risky for business at Disney. Persistence pays off, it's like I always say ""If you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything""."
21.03.2022,9.0,"Esse file é ARTE. Muito bom e legal. O Marty é muito top e o doc também é muito show.recomendo demais esse filme,de volta para o futuro. Também tem o dois que é muito melhor que esse e o três que tá pau a pau com esse aqui."
16.03.2022,10.0,This is good in so many ways I don't know how to put it in words but I'll try. The characters are perfect and same with the storyline. Biff tannen is a idiot and looks like one (WITCH IS PERFECT) I just love the storyline and the time machine (OBVIOUSLY !!) The end. Also Marty McFly is the best name ever . THE ACTUAL END NOW.
13.03.2022,10.0,"This movie never gets old. Everything about this movie is just perfect. Awesome. 😀😀
What a movie !!!!I was not even born when this movie was released. But I still remember the excitement I felt when I watched it in the 90's. I still get the same excitement when I watch it now."
28.02.2022,10.0,"It's a classic for a reason, this film genuinely never gets old. It is absolutely phenomenal, from an amazing score, to awesome characters, this film truly has it all. There will always be a special place in my heart for doc."
27.02.2022,10.0,"Such a good film that was a cultural reset for time travel movies. The aesthetic is so unique and has inspired so many other films, in addition to being a pop culture item (think about how many parties and events are themed after B2TF!) Would highly recommend."
23.02.2022,10.0,"I was somewhat disappointed by the explicit sexuality, but seeing Michael J Fox wiggle his little legs on stage totally made up for it! I haven't seen the sequel yet but I hope that they make Biff less sexy in it, his raw sexual energy was just too much to bear."
13.02.2022,10.0,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, my brother recommended it to me.My brother recommended this film to me because for him it was framed by childhood, since the film is from his time.The environment that is used in this film, that context of the 85s and how they think the future is incredible."
13.02.2022,10.0,"Being 80's kid, I grew up watching this movie and I can so relate it to the future and what can I say I still watch it with my kids. Guess what!!! I watch it like a child as if I am watching it for the first time.I never get tired watching it over again."
07.02.2022,10.0,"My family and I have watched this film so many times I've lost count. I think my husband basically has it memorized! It's a great family movie that seems to never age. It's clever, funny, suspenseful, futuristic, and just an all-around great movie.Hopefully everyone has seen it. If you haven't, it's highly recommended!"
06.02.2022,10.0,"The stars aligned for Robert Zemeckis in 1985. Stoltz out and Fox in was the first sliding door that ensured this masterpiece has endured. Lloyd is perfect as Doc, and Wilson's Biff is one of the great villains that mixes gormlessness with genuine menace. Glover nearly steals the film, and his absence in the two sequels is sorely missed upon rewatching the original. But this is Fox's film. He is so effortlessly charming and funny (and convincingly tough for a man of his stature) that he dominates every scene among hugely talented character actors. Make no mistake, this guy was a superstar and BTTF launched his career 10/10."
04.02.2022,9.0,"Genius made into a movie in all its senses, to be classic so to speak, it does not require very real special effects because it does not, a spectacular script, memorable characters, well-shot sets, a story never seen back then, and a trilogy that will will leave you waiting more and more.I recommend it yes or yes, it is one of those works that we will never see again."
03.02.2022,8.0,"Rlly great movie to watch with the family, popcorn and hot chocolate. Nice time, pretty funny, though by no means is it especially intellectual or thought provoking."
03.02.2022,10.0,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? And Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways."
01.02.2022,10.0,The first time I saw this movie I was 14 years old. And watched it outside in the window of a video store. I accidentally started the look and was hooked till the end. Even when it started to rain I needed to see the end of this movie. This movie has took me by surprise and never let go. What an all-time classic.
31.01.2022,10.0,"Back to the Future's success and creation of this generation's love and praise for this movie is one that was attained through its untouchable writing, incredible directing, and astonishing cast. The funny, adventurous time-traveling story is one that has been showered with popularity due to writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale's incredible storytelling. Their capability to show a new and improved concept when dealing with the popular time-traveling genre and making it memorable and exciting is what attains the sci-fi fanatic's attention. Zemeckis directing truly shines in Back to the Future; his camera work allows the movie to be an intriguing and entertaining film for the younger audience, contrasting the use of fast-paced action sequences and calm, smooth romantic sequences and with it, latch the audience further with the storyline, characters, and memorable scenes to create an unforgettable first impression. The cast's ability to portray believable characters that'll make the audience love and connect with them is exactly what Back to the Future achieves. Michael J. Fox's interpretation of Marty's charm and juvenility and Christopher Lloyd's portrayal of Doc Brown's funny, comedic, and science freak self fulfill the audience's desire for a relatable, comedy movie that has scientific fiction sprinkled all around it. Many ingredients go into the creation of good filmmaking, but the Back to the Future film truly goes up and beyond in its decision of screenwriting, directing, and cast. Sci-fi, comedy, and time-traveling fanatics would undoubtedly leave a place in their hearts for this film as it checks off every box in their genre of amazing filmmaking."
31.01.2022,10.0,Amazing movie. I am watching and enjoying all 3 parts all of them. Have torrent subject but looks like one movie. They don't make move as like this quality Anymore.
19.01.2022,8.0,"It seems to me, ""Back to the Future"" - the best trilogy in the entire history of television. It always happens that the first film is much more interesting than the rest, and they only spoil the impression of history. Here is the opposite. For example, I don't know which one of the three films I like.And success depends not even from actors, but from the screenwriter, the regentiness and producer. In these films there are everything: and stunning special effects, and super-actors, and an excellent script. And their success was not not for anyone a surprise: all the rewards they won - there is for what. I looked at this films an incredible number of times, but, of course, I'll see again as soon as the time appears."
19.01.2022,10.0,"In honor of the 35th anniversary of the film's release, the viewer can again enjoy the classic masterpiece of science fiction in December of the year of 2020, which is extremely memorable in terms of the number of restrictions and bans.And it seems that the picture is not only not outdated, but also uniquely relevant in modern times. Perfectly balanced plot, amazing combination of comedy and science, amazing homage to the old days and an immense desire to know the future.It's amazing how Zemeckis and Gale brilliantly crafted the story with a vision for a future sequel, brilliantly incorporating pop culture Easter eggs from the 50s and 80s. Stunning characters are embodied on the screen by perfectly matched actors. Fox and Lloyd thus generally acquired the status of icons, becoming objects of fan dreams for years to come.And with tears of joy in your eyes, you are again watching a familiar story, only now you have a big screen in front of you, allowing you to feel, as if for the first time, all the versatility of the cult masterpiece!"
19.01.2022,10.0,"This is, without a doubt, the greatest movie I have ever seen. Nothing can top how perfect this is. The actors all do a fantastic job, the comedic moments are incredibly funny, and the story and script are two things that will forever be memorable. This is a movie that just wouldn't hit the same if it was remade today. Everybody should see the film and learn a valuable lesson from it, as we should all remember that time is what we make of it."
19.01.2022,9.0,"This picture is perfect for family viewing, there are elements of the trailer, and family drama, and adventure. And when all these ingredients start to spin around time travel, then the science genre appears."
19.01.2022,10.0,"If I want something adventurous and fantastic, then I watch this movie. This is the first time travel movie I've watched.The film is set in 1985 and 1955. That is, there are two storylines in it. Oh, three, to be exact, since there is also a plot line ""back to 1985"".Starring teenager Marty, played by Michael J. Fox, he is friends with an eccentric scientist, played by Christopher Lloyd. The main actors played their roles perfectly. As a child, I loved watching the scientist, whom Marty called just Doc.I've always found this movie very interesting. It looks in one breath.The film earned the Hugo Award, Saturn, Oscar... therefore, I cannot give a low rating. And I wouldn't have. The film of my childhood. Very interesting.I recommend it for viewing!Thanks for your attention!"
19.01.2022,10.0,"Good day, dear friends!As for me, the first part of the trilogy about time travel is the coolest. Why? Firstly, she is the most sincere of all three. Secondly, there is very cool music, both in the background and in reality.Michael J. Fox is still so young here, such a sweetheart, when I watched this film as a child, I simply did not forget not to fall in love with his antics, smile and how he plays the guitar.Since then, the theme of time travel is probably my favorite.You review and understand that the quality of the picture is simply amazing. After so many years, it doesn't look that good. Simple and funny dialogues, an understandable plot without subsidence and any holes. We understand the motivation of each of the characters in the film.I give ten out of ten. I can watch it every year and enjoy.Thank you for your attention! Happy viewing!"
19.01.2022,9.0,"Time travel is the most illogical and, at the same time, truly inexhaustible and incredibly fascinating topic, a bottomless barrel of plots for fantastic cinema. ""Back to the Future"" is one of the best science fiction films in the history of cinema, shot on this subject, a real cult of the genre.However, it is practically impossible to determine the genre affiliation of this picture. This is, perhaps, the standard of how to make a film, the plot of which is based on so many genres: this is comedy, science fiction, drama, adventure, and even a thriller! The element of each genre here is carefully verified and fits very harmoniously into the overall style of the picture."
12.01.2022,10.0,"I have watched this movie thousand times. It is s amazing, and it is definitely worth watching. The interesting thing about the movie is that so many incidents are coming to true."
05.01.2022,10.0,"From the perfectly casted actors, Alan Silvestri's score and the time machine designed out of a Delorean.This movie is perfect and timeless, many different generations will embrace it.Even the poster is a classic!!"
30.12.2021,10.0,"This movie takes me back to my childhood. I remember seeing this in the movie theater and being so excited about the ""future"" now im in the future and i wish things were siple as back then."
29.12.2021,9.0,"What's not to love about this film? It's just such a joy from start to finish. One of those 80s films like 'The Goonies', 'E. T', 'Ghostbusters' etc that is so full of adventure, excitement, wonder, and can be enjoyed by all ages.This film has been reviewed to death by this point so there's nothing I can say that will be very original.The plot is fantastic, so fun and well paced, with great humour and emotional beats. It has an all time classic soundtrack. Incredibly fun and engaging performances from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd.Back to the Future is a classic. Almost everything about it is iconic and it really is a class and joyous piece of cinema."
25.12.2021,10.0,"Eccentric scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents a time machine and by accident his friend Marty (Michael J Fox) goes back in time to a point where his parents first met and he messes things up risking his own existence. He seeks out a younger Doc Brown to help him get back to the future.One of a few completely perfect stories, brilliantly brought to the screen by Robert Zemeckis and acted by the wonderful double act of Fox and Lloyd. The consequences of playing with time are cleverly demonstrated leading to a wonderful and exciting climax. The support cast are excellent including the decidedly odd Crispin Glover. Superb."
24.12.2021,10.0,"This should go down as one of the greatest movies of all time. Practically flawless in every way, enjoyable from beginning to end, Back To The Future is in my opinion a masterpiece."
19.12.2021,10.0,"The script is perfect, all the temporal intertwining are well linked together. Everyone's interpretation is magnificent, especially by M. J. Fox and C. Lloyd who are always credible. The director managed to convey the right atmosphere, to make people smile and to make people think. Beautiful and impressive soundtrack. One of the few films from the 1980s whose special effects are still believable today!"
18.12.2021,8.0,"I don't know dude but this movie was childhood movie very worthy, when sometime i have a kid i will show my kid back to the future then they know old childhood movies is wonderful."
16.12.2021,9.0,"I must have seen this movie at least 5, 6 times through all my life even tho I have never reviewed it. Why I am doing it now then? Well, a while ago I saw an episode of THE MOVIES THAT MADE US where they discussed the fact that Eric Stoltz (who went on to be Rocky Dennis in MASK) was the original Marty McFly but he was fired because he thought that the movie was a drama and not a comedy as Robert Zemeckis intended it. And despite today there are only a few glimpses of Stoltz's original footage, the version we all know is just great.As there are already more than 1,350 reviews for this movie already I'll be brief. High school student Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time to 1955 with the invention of a time machine created by his eccentric friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Marty meets his parents when they were not married yet and for adjusting things in the future he makes them meet again in a wiser way so that in 1985 there will be positive changes.The acting is good. Michael J. Fox was born for the role of Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd is great in one of his most memorable roles along that of Judge Doom of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT. The soundtrack is among the best for a movie of this genre and gives also lots of nostalgic vibes. And the script is very funny and witty.Overall, one of those family movies that stands the test of time and manages to be safe for younger folks. A rare quality in today's family movies."
16.12.2021,9.0,"This is a great movie from my childhood. It used to be shown on TV frequently until the 2000s. I rewatched it after many years from a more critical point of view. It has a genuine screenplay and includes many great characters. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are great lead actors. But this is not all, the supporting cast (Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, ...) is also awesome. The movie has very nice settings, visual effects and songs. All these give successfully the impression of a fictional world. This is one movie that every child should see before growing up."
14.12.2021,10.0,"Not much I can say that hasnt been said about this movie. People and critics often say Steven Spielberg and the huge movies wrecked Hollywood well WE ALL DISAGREE films like this, Jaws ,Raiders, Alien,Gladiator, all the way up to Guardians of the galaxy the big budget film has its home . I cant imagine a world without Back to the future in it, and the cast what a GIFT they gave to us , we get to enjoy Michael J Fox Cristopher Lloyd, Lea, etc. Forever!!TO THE CAST AND CREW BRAVO!!THANK YOU!!!"
09.12.2021,10.0,"The pairing of Fox and Lloyd is nair unbeatable. I know that Eric Stoltz was the original marty and he is a great actor. However Fox IS and always will be Marty McFly, its a heart warming, action packed, laugh riot of a family movie and a great way of capturing the memories of the 80s."
08.12.2021,10.0,"BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of my favourite movies, even if it was released before I was born. It is very funny and full of suspense, memorable scenes and even inspirational quotes.The time travel theme was a new one back then, but the cast delivered a fantastic performance to the public."
07.12.2021,10.0,"(There is a little spoiler but it wont ruin your experience at all) I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I love how the original this is, and the fact that the sequels are so similar, but they are both so good, especially the 3rd film. This movie has such witty humor, and it is good from start to finish. It is actually really suspenseful, along with the other films. I cant believe the CGI was this good for a movie made in 1985! The casttttttt, Christopher Lloyd is one of my favorite actors just for this role ""Great scott, this is such a good movie"" and Michael J Fox is a really good character and him meeting his young dad was really funny. Overall a 10/10 film and is in my top 5."
04.12.2021,8.0,"Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager in Hill Valley, California in 1985 - and then in 1955. Dr Emmett Brown's time machine has flung Marty 30 years back in time and he's stranded there unless the 1955 Doc Brown can help him. Worse: Marty's own mother, here a high school teenager, is falling for him instead of his father.It sounds like a clichéd science fiction movie that could only appeal to fans of the genre - but that couldn't be more wrong. A huge hit, it appealed across the board for its invention, its exuberant energy, and the famous finale - so tense, so very exciting and yet able to make you gasp and laugh at the same time."
04.12.2021,8.0,"Back to the Future makes time travel not only fun, but also brings science fiction to the masses in a comedic adventure that follows teenager Marty McFly, played Michael J. Fox. Fox makes this movie click. His charming qualities and well-timed lines with his co-stars, including Christopher Lloyd (Dr Emmett Brown) and Leah Thompson, will find you cheering and laughing throughout the movie.Back to the Future is a perfect flick for those with school-aged children on up. This film has some mild fighting and name calling."

30.11.2021,8.0,"Time travel from 1985 to 1955, back to 1985,, on to 2015,, back to 1985,, back to 1955,,, then onto 1855,,, ending with a last time jump back to 1985!! I know,, a lot to keep up with,,,Classic all the way!! What else can be said about this treasure of a movie from the 1980s/my childhood?Quotes - ""Great Scott!"" & ""This is heavy.""8.5 rating is right!!"
17.11.2021,10.0,"Review By Kamal KEverything about Back To The Future is awesome, well, almost everything. Marty McFly, or, Calven Klein's adventure in the 50's is kinda awkward sometimes, specifically everything to do with younger Lorrain. The amount of thirst in those scenes was astounding. Throughout the movie, events are changed in such a way that the future still happens, but everyone seemingly ""grew up"" in terms of character development, like Marty McFly's dad going from a cowardly man child to someone actually capable of defending himself, but the sequel shows the one in actual need of growing up is Marty McFly himself. Old Marty is a lot like young George McFly, and lets people take advantage of him. The next sequel, Back to The Future 3 shows Marty McFly grow in character, and by the end of the film he isn't a reckless chode with a ""I'm not a chicken"" complex. George McFly takes a single movie to develope character whereas it takes 3 adventures for Marty McFly to grow as a character, and it's all entertaining to watch. Final Verdict 10/10."
16.11.2021,10.0,"The title says it all! Nothing can compare to this film! There's few films I can watch over and over again, but every year I watch this and each time it brings the same joy as the first time I watched!"
15.11.2021,10.0,"I'm not one of those who throw around the word ""masterpiece"" in every sentence. Heck I'm not even that much of a sci-fi fan but this movie is just so outstanding and fun. There ware very few movies which ties everything that happens in the plot and the loose-ends, throwbacks etc so smoothly and perfectly by the end. Michael J. Fox did and absolutely wonderful job playing the role of Marty mcfky and I don't think any other actor in the world would fit the role so much. The story is awesome, fun and very entertaining with the mix of perfect humor. Overall a very engaging and re-watchable movie."
09.11.2021,9.0,Very amusing and fun. Amusant if you will. The only thing that would've made it better was if marty had superstrength and could fly. I recommend this film to people of all ages.
09.11.2021,10.0,The storyline is so complex. Really enjoy the movie. Always will be a classic. This movie never loses its fire and will live on for generations to come.

18.10.2021,10.0,"Back to the Future is a sci-fi/adventure movie released in 1985, and directed by Robert Zemeckis, the story follows a California teen, Marty ""Micheal J Fox"" and his adventure in a time traveling delorean made by his eccentric scientist friend Dr. Emmet Brown ""Christopher Lloyd"".

He re-groups with Dr. Emmet Brown, or Doc, and they work together to fix the delorean so Marty can travel back to present day. But, Marty has to deal with a new lifestyle in 1955, how to act, and even his young parents.... Go watch Back to the Future!!"
07.10.2021,10.0,One of a few movies that never ages. 'Back to the Future' is a kind of film that gets better and better with the passage of time. A movie you can watch over and over again.Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown and Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly steals the show in this amazingly good Robert Zemeckis' Masterpiece. Time travel can never be funnier and cooler than that!One of those movies no one can remake and One of the Greatest Classics ever!
06.10.2021,10.0,"A masterpiece without a doubt, and for me the best science fiction film in the history of cinema (and especially comedy), a family to enjoy a lot and family, and that they are one of those films that when you finish them you have a smile on your face. Face of satisfaction, extraordinary script and an extraordinary charisma of all people. A must see movie."
03.10.2021,10.0,"What can you say... Back to the Future, one of the most wonderful movies ever!"
29.09.2021,9.0,"Because if you watch it ten times or more, you begin to see poor quality details of the movie. It doesn't mean that the movie is not good. It is still a nice movie. But if you watch it ten times, you remember some poor quality details of it. And you can't remember this as a great movie. Because you know it is a movie and there are some shooting mistakes or maybe low budget details and something like that. If you watch it two or three times in twenty years, that is great. Because you only remember good parts of the movie. You remember just that goodness. And you can say ""yes it is a great movie"". But when you say that you don't remember the whole film actually. Because you watched it ten years ago.That's all."
08.09.2021,10.0,"This is the definitive movie to watch if u love time travel movies. Not only has comedy, action and jokes, the time machine(the delorean dmc 12) is a worlwide recognized vehicle. The actors all play believing in the plot, the pace is never slow, and the music is great."
03.09.2021,9.0,"Well what can I say that hasn't already been said, just watch the film."
02.09.2021,10.0,"I remember watching this as a kid and just rewatching it over and over and over again because I didn't get bored of the movie because of how the plot the characters and the setting was so good, this is why this is my favorite movie of all time and the second one, Robert Zemeckis knows how to direct a film very well and he showed off his talents here thank you."
29.08.2021,10.0,The greatest of all time. This movies ability to reference little things from early sections of the movie is amazing. It's beautifully made with a fun storyline for all generations. This is a must see if you love movies.
24.08.2021,4.0,"It may be regarded as a classic but I never liked it, it is 80s cheesy like the bad guys are unwatchable it's that bad. Doc is annoying too."
22.08.2021,9.0,"Perfect acting from Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, and Tom Wilson. Absolutely and hilariously iconic and the best time travel movie there is, since it inspired so many others!"
18.08.2021,8.0,What can i say ?It is a classic...................
15.08.2021,10.0,I felt love with this movie when I first saw it. According to me it's the best sci-fi Movie.
15.08.2021,10.0,"Back to the Future is cinema history! One of the best blockbusters of the 80s and why not, of history. It has charismatic and endearing characters like Mary McFly (Michael J. Fox), Dr. Emmet (C. Lloyd), Lorraine (L. Thompson) and many more, an easy to understand story that has a very dynamic rhythm and obviously a soundtrack that is still remembered today. If you haven't seen it yet, I don't know what you're waiting for."
10.08.2021,10.0,This is my all time favorite movie. I love movies about time travel. I was born after this movie came out but it's still my favorite movie and I love watching it.
06.08.2021,9.0,"Entertainment for all ages, sci-fi shenanigan, rom-com, iconic soundtrack... what's not to like?"
04.08.2021,9.0,"Not many films inspired as many iconic quotes as this film did. What a wild ride. I true cinematic classic. Everything; cast, plot, props, everything was perfect. Definitely worthy of the very high IMDb score!"
03.08.2021,10.0,What a classic! You don't get better than the 80s masterpiece that masters the art of time travel. Back To The Future is a masterpiece and always will be. Easily one of my favourites of ALL TIME
30.07.2021,10.0,A must watch for any time travel anime fans especially steins gateVery entertaining ! Wonderful 9/10 go watch it .
29.07.2021,10.0,"Great work from the team behind the Movie. The movie start with a comedy but at the same time the movie tells a brilliant idea about time travel. The doctor invented a time travel vehicle in which we can set the year , date, and time to explore the future.but suddenly our hero got stuck in his same city yers ago from there he was not born. ...
OVERALL MUST WATCH MOVIE'..."
29.07.2021,10.0,"One of the Greatest Movies ever made. Easily the best Time-travel story. Bar none. The writing is rock-solid, the double-act of Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd are the heart and soul of this story and the timeless and epic score of Alan Silvestri gives the movie so much heart that makes it feel larger in scale.This movie has something that modern Hollywood lacks - re-watch value. Very few movies today have performances that make you want to watch them again. I can say that Avengers: End Game is a great movie, but does it have the same re-watch value as Back to the Future? In my professional & personal opinion - no.The First Movie has not aged a day - it feels fresh and new every time you see it. I have lost count of how many times I've seen it over the years but I still laugh every time Biff gets ""the make like a tree"" line wrong and the penultimate Clock Tower scene is a still a pulse-racing experience to this day.Back to the Future is a Movie that will be talked about and enjoyed long after we're gone.It's timeless."
29.07.2021,9.0,Best part from the best triology!Awesome Film with awesome music!
25.07.2021,10.0,"Beautiful film that never gets old and that always remains fun and engaging and that proposes a beautiful story, nice and very deep on time. The film is very interesting and manages to hold you glued to the screen for its entire duration without ever getting tired."
19.07.2021,8.0,"Well, OK, the beginning scene, were everything starts is a tad bit over the top.And by a tad bit, I mean a huge mammoth chunk. The time travel mechanics are stupid, but its OK.This is a movie that they want you to laugh at those things. They aren't serious about anything at all. So go ahead and have a good laugh, at all the insane time travel stuff.Oddly, just like Indiana Jones, this follows the Great-Bad-Good pattern. If you are thinking about watching the trilogy, don't stress out about the middle one."
14.07.2021,10.0,"My my kids got two days in a row of my pandemic Film Appreciation Course, this time introducing them to the 80s time travel classic ""Back to the Future."" My kids laughed at all the right parts, thought Marty and Doc funny, and were completely caught up in the excitement and suspense of the clocktower finale. During that clocktower finale, one of my daughters, who wasn't familiar with ""suspense"" as a film term said ""This movie is giving me ANXIETY!"" They were completely into the film, just as I was when I was 13 or 14 when I first saw it in the theater. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, who only had three movie credits to his name before this, the very funny TV movie ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" the very funny and very crass Kurt Russell comedy ""Used Cars,"" and then ""Romancing the Stone,"" which was an unexpected hit that led the studios to take a look at his other projects. If you're wondering how Spielberg got involved in this film, Zemeckis and his writing partner, Bob Gale, wrote Spielberg's infamous bomb ""1941,"" which I think is an under appreciated comedy classic I still love to this day. Spielberg also produced Zemeckis' first film ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and when the studio was uncomfortable with him selecting a first time director he stuck by Zemeckis but had to promise the studio if things went badly he'd take over as director. But I digress. In summary, ""Back to the Future"" has a great cast (even look fast for Billy Zane in his film debut as one of Biff's toadies), terrific humor, and genuine heart. Although seemingly lightweight, ""Back to the Future"" really is an American film classic. FUN FACT(s)! When Thomas F. Wilson, who played Biff, is asked about this movie by fans, he'll often hand them a postcard of frequently asked questions as a timesaver, which reads:""I'm Tom Wilson. I was in all three 'Back To The Future' movies. Michael J. Fox is nice. I'm not in close contact with him. Christopher Lloyd is nice. He is a very shy man. Crispin Glover is unusual, but not as unusual as he sometimes presents himself. We got along nicely. Lea Thompson is nice. Eric Stoltz originally played Marty, but was fired due to performance issues. The first movie was shot in 1984 and '85. The sequels were shot 'back to back,' never before attempted by a movie studio. The hoverboards didn't really fly, we were hanging by wires from a crane. The manure was made of peat moss, cork, dirt, and a food agent that made it sticky. The Delorean was an inferior automobile, and nearly impossible for a person of normal size like myself to enter and exit. There are many tiny plot points hidden in the movies, but I don't know what they are. Among many improvisations of the set, I coined the term 'butthead,' as well as 'Make like a tree, and get out of here.' The third movie was my favorite, since I got to learn western skills like riding, roping, quick draw, and shooting a six-shooter, a great adventure for a guy from Philadelphia."""
13.07.2021,10.0,The greatest movie mankind has ever/will ever create. No cinema will ever top this brilliant masterpiece.
09.07.2021,9.0,"What a classic! Marty McFly and Doc Brown are two of the best characters in cinematic history. The plot was fun, captivating, emotional and well driven. The film takes you to another time in a way other movies have not been able to do. Loved it!"
03.07.2021,10.0,"The first part of the ""Back to the Future trilogy"" was published in 1985. The director Robert Zemeckis and the actors, especially Michael J. Fox (Marty Mc Fly) and Christopher Lloyd (Doctor Emett Brown) as the main characters created a fantastic film with an exciting storyline. The filmography is to be assigned to the science-fiction and comedy sector with the mixture of action and a lot of jokes.
The crazy professor Emett Brown develops a time machine included a special invention - the ""Flux capacitor"". He installed the device in a Delorean, which runs because of the high energy demand with plutonium - a high energetic and radioactive element. When doctor Emett wants to present his new invention to Marty - a boy from the neighbourhood - he was shot down by lybian terrorists, from whom he had stolen the plutonium earlier. To escape the dangerous situation Marty must use the time machine. Before he could do anything Marty lands in the year 1955 where he must save the professor and not at least himself and his whole family.
In the first part and also in the two others of the ""Back to the future trilogy"" there is a classic fight between the good and the evil. Biff Tannen and his gang are the bullies in Hill Valley, the setting of the film, which looks older or more futuristic due to the change to different time zones. In the future Biffs son and in the past Biffs dad are the troublemakers Marty has to deal with.
In my opinion the movie is one of amazing film works I ever saw. The acting skills of the single characters are wonderful and very satisfying. In addition to that the film effects and the soundtrack is wonderful although the film was made 35 years ago. I like the vibe of the whole movie, which always has a surprise in store. if you want to see for yourself, you absolutely have to watch the film. You will definitely not regret it."
03.07.2021,9.0,"We know the story so I'll save one the usual grief of having to read the plotline over again & again. Fact is, most of us grew up w/it beginning in the 80'S. Watching it in the evening while microwave popcorn was also a ""new thing"". Back to the Future has been a timeless film in my opinion. 1 that even if ya happen to catch it while flipping thru the channels you end up staying w/it. Character development is Supreme, plot is fantastic, comedy is added by a number of characters throughout the entire movie while still keeping just enough forward drama to not forget the point of ""I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE 80's.""
Who, after all....Would want to leave the 80's😎"
29.06.2021,8.0,This was my favortie movie when I was a kid and it still is my favortie movie I seen it a lot as a kid it's still a really good movie Michael j fox is a good actor the soundtrack is good too and two and three are good too so if you like theses type of movies you should check it out.
19.06.2021,10.0,I love this trilogy. I was weaned on them in the 1980s and now my kids love them. Can't beat this.
17.06.2021,7.0,"Watched this movie for the first time only a few years back and couldn't believe I'd never watched it before. It's a really good story. So many different characters and scenes, story flows well although the mother/son thing is quite weird. 3rd instalment is my favourite."
13.06.2021,10.0,"Best feature film ever made, imo! The cast, crew, script, music and all are top notch!"
08.06.2021,10.0,"A wonderful movie. Everyone who watched this movie, his fans. One of the classics of cinema. Directed photography. Impressive acting. Everything is wonderful in this masterpiece. I love this movie so much 10/10."
05.06.2021,10.0,1985 movie with such good editing and camera. It's unbelievable.
23.05.2021,8.0,"Such a great movie, great vibes, good story, makes a classic film."
21.05.2021,10.0,An amazing film with an amazing story. Great performances. Definitely worth a watch.
19.05.2021,10.0,It was just a mind-blowing movie I've ever seen.And I'm wondering why I doesn't catch up the place in top places 'cause the settings and also the thought & thinking was beyond imagination from 1985's. None of them now a days make a movie like this. It's a classic sci-fi ever beaten by none.
18.05.2021,10.0,"10 out of 10 is the only option. This movie is a legend and it greatly affected the whole world And even now it doesn't look outdated, or maybe just a little. So if it is not ten, I don't know what movie can deserve such rating."
18.05.2021,8.0,"In retrospect of 80s, with a light convey and future themed movie, this one was understandable to became a hit at that time. The story is intriguing right after the few first minutes and it keeps going until the last minutes. It gave me short of curiosity of what would happen next as if I was in the middle of the scene. Even after watching it more than 30 years after it released, it still amazed me on how this idea coming from 80s. I simply just love this."
15.05.2021,10.0,"A scientist invents a time machine that accidentally sends his young friend back to 1955.This is a classic adventure-comedy with great characters, sci-fi concepts and storytelling. Certain elements require a suspension of disbelief, however it's so enjoyable you get swept along with it.The plot is simple but superbly detailed in how it takes a number of characters through individual arcs and focuses on period details, particularly in emphasising the fish out of water angle of Marty McFly as an 80s kid trapped in his parents era. Practically everything that happens links to something else that occurs at a later point in the story. Whilst doing all of the above it takes us on a highly enjoyable and thrilling adventure.One of its biggest strengths is a sharp script that provides great comedy, lots of cultural references and quotable lines from many characters such as Marty, Doc, George, Lorraine and Biff.This is a movie with a number of memorable scenes such as at Twin Pines Mall, the Enchantment Under The Sea dance and the lightening bolt at the clock tower. In fact, the movie creates an almost living and breathing character out of the fictional town of Hill Valley as we have great scenes in numerous locations such as Lou's Diner, Lyon Estates and Courthouse in different eras.The visuals are brilliant with great cinematography, period detail, costumes and visual effects. The DeLorean car used as the basis for the time machine is an inspired creative idea and is rightfully now a pop culture icon.There is a fantastic soundtrack with a great mixture of original score and pop music. It goes without saying that the general sound mixing and effects are superb.Michael J Fox does a star turn as Marty and effortlessly carries the story with fantastic charisma and performance. He is supported wonderfully by Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Thomas F Wilson, who all play memorable characters in both time periods. Christopher Lloyd is a lot of fun as Doc Brown but occasionally strays over the top with a tendency to shout so many lines.The amazing aspect of looking back at it in 2021 is that you now see two past eras depicted."
30.04.2021,10.0,One of the greatest movie in the 80s and if you had not seen this film go and Watch it right now all 3 back to the future movies are amazing and the first one is the best one because of the story and the first back to the future was a masterpiece in my opinion I still Watch that movie every year because it is that great of a movie to watch and it is in my top 3 great movies of all time and if you like Science you will love back to the future and if you are a 80s kid and had not Watch this movie go ahead and watch it it's a classic and this movie alone got me to it got in to movies reviews.
28.04.2021,10.0,"Doc: This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.Marty: Whoa, wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?Doc: Precisely!Marty: Whoa, this is heavy.Doc: There's that word again: ""heavy."" Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?Typical dialogue from this great film.Funny end to end.Must watch."
25.04.2021,10.0,"AS A PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOPATH, I AGREE WITH THE FARMER SHOOTING THE GUN AT THE ALIEN MAN. I ALSO LOVE DOC BROWN BECAUSE HE REMINDS ME OF MYSELF. ESPECIALLY THAT ONE TIME I PULLED A BIG BRAIN MOVE ON WALGREEN'S AT 1:03 AM. I PULLED UP IN MY DELOREAN AND BOUGHT A POSTER OF MYSELF. I REALLY WISH MY DELOREAN COULD TIME TRAVEL, THOUGH. I'D GO BACK IN TIME AND STOP MYSELF FROM PLAGIARIZING FINDING NEMO. MAYBE ROSE WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT ME. WHERE WAS DOC WHEN I NEEDED HIM MOST?"
24.04.2021,10.0,"Back to the future... Where do I begin? In the past or the present or the future. I'll start by saying this movie is the best one in the franchise, the second is also good but I have to say this one is the best, one of my favourite time travel comedies, definitely one of those worthy of a rewatch over and over I even went to the cinema for the anniversary such a great film.Michael J. Fox is great in this, luckily he's in all 3 highly recommend!!"
22.04.2021,10.0,"I am a CRAZY fan of these movies (I'm not joking. I have a google slides full of over 1,000 slides of just back to the future behind the scenes pictures). The writing is amazing, acting, plot, everything! The chemistry between all the actors was very good and made the movie flow perfectly. And to be honest, who doesn't want to see a film with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd in it?!?!"
22.04.2021,10.0,"Is it a perfect movie? I dunno, probably not. But ratings are subjective. It's fun and Christopher Lloyd has been one of my favorite actors since childhood. So it gets a 10."
21.04.2021,10.0,"The best movie ever aired, its a fact. Just pure Greatest the movie is nearly 2hours long and you feel like 1 hour, this movie should be called in another way, because its not even in the same universe than all the others. Maybe its because this movie is from the future.Thank you Mister Zemeckis thank you Mister Spielberg thank YOU mister Michael J fox and Thank YOU mister Christopher Lloyd, you guys are True legend !"
20.04.2021,10.0,"It's been almost 36 years after the release of this movie, and it still keeps being as enjoyable as it surely was back then. A classic no one should ever miss in their life."
10.04.2021,10.0,"At other movie maybe the time machine is like a simple portal, but in this movie they make great model time machine."
07.04.2021,10.0,"The stage curtains open ...I was 16 when ""Back to the Future"" came out. One month after it was released to theaters, ""Teen Wolf"" also hit the big screen. That was a busy summer for Michael J. Fox, who starred in both films. One of my friends had gone to see them both and then reported that ""Teen Wolf"" was the best one of the two. So, I did what he did ... I watched them both as a double feature. After I had watched both films, I wondered what he was on, because ""Back to the Future"" was CLEARLY the best movie. And to this day, it remains one of my all-time favorites.Marty McFly (Fox) is your average 80's teen who dreams of someday making it big as a rock star, has a hot girlfriend, skateboards his way around town, and who has a close friendship with a bit of a madcap scientist named Emmett Brown (Christopher LLoyd), who he affectionately calls Doc. One night, Doc has Marty meet him at the parking lot of a mall where he unveils his latest project ... a DeLorean he has converted into a time machine. During a mishap, Marty is accidentally sent back to the year 1955 where he runs into his parents when they were his age. Now Marty faces the reality of being erased from existence, unless the 1955 Doc Brown can help him get back to the future.I absolutely loved this movie when I first saw it, and I still do today. To say that it is a classic would actually be an understatement, though it truly is. It is the essence of movie magic, and helped to influence countless people, having a large impact on future movies and future lives. It is still just as pertinent today as it was back then. The humor is matched only by it's excitement - and both were abundant. The special effects were great for their time, the cast was strong, and the music memorable.I can't recommend this movie enough. Some people comment on the relationship between Marty and his mother as a teen as being inappropriate - well, if that is all you got out of it, you missed the point completely. ""Back to the Future"" is viable and entertaining, and has its rightful place in the lore of film legends. This is a perfect 10 stars out of 10. If only they made movies like this today."
05.04.2021,8.0,I want to start off by saying I'm not born in the 1980s. But as a early 2000s kid I think this movie is great. It makes this time for movies look so fun and I think it's a really good idea for a story. I love the style and I think it does a good job being funny. Also little side note but I love Marty's sneakers. I highly recommend this movie and would rate it a 8/10.
04.04.2021,10.0,What can i say that hasnt already been said these movies are a work of art def a masterpiece.
02.04.2021,10.0,I LOVE IT. Best movie ever!!!! Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are perfect!!!!!
30.03.2021,10.0,"""What a great adventure, i really really have a good time with this movie, Michael J. Fox perfomance was amazing, Christopher Llyod was incredible, Alan Silvestri score always give me chills, this movie is amazing, it's very different from any time travel movie i've ever watch, overall Back To The Future for me is not only a movie but a truly great adventure, i highly recommended"""
28.03.2021,10.0,"A masterpiece hands down. Best script, score, casting, and pacing ever put to screen. Be it Truffault or Tarkovsky, nothing beats this. Best movie ever made."
27.03.2021,10.0,36 years after it's release and it still shines like a new penny. I've watched it at least 100 without exaggeration. The fantasy of time travel gets everyone's attention. BtF allows us to believe it and enjoy it at the same time. The cast is magical together to say the least. Another reason BTF keeps drawing attention is because you get to compare the technology that in 1985 was considered futuristic with current technology while looking back at 1950's tech. BtF is truly a masterpiece.
24.03.2021,10.0,Such an honest pure emotion movie in a scifi scale.. This movie. is geniously done.

28.02.2021,10.0,"Back to the Future is a masterpiece of a film about time travel, changing the idea of the subject for decades to come.The acting is amazing in this piece of cinematic history. They knew what they were doing when they casted the likes of Micheal J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as a good young person-old person duo, alongside Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, and Claudia Wells in great supporting roles.The plot, the characters, the comedy, the love, and the amazing special affects helped shape this film into movie everyone should see (if they are into this sort of thing).Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis knew what they were doing, along with Alan Silvestri's music score for it.10/10."
24.02.2021,9.0,I really like rewatching this. I find it amusing how they pictured us living in today's time. Characters are very believable. There would be some moments though that you'd overthink things and make you wonder the what ifs especially with a time machine. :)
23.02.2021,5.0,"Overrated, as many later movies and shows did take the time travel theme to fascinating lengths, leaving this stuck back in time. I can understand its pioneering qualities, but now it seems dilluted, when put alongside other good works on same general topic. Spielberg had his magic, but after a while, got repetitive. Looking back, it seems clear that he tried to recapture the nostalgia of his childhood, the things those kids dreamt and imagined, which is fine in itself, but gets you only so far. The standard small town, people, relationships (popular kids, loner, bullying, lifelong archenemies) somehow feel museum like today. Without the drop of nostalgia, the movie is more like a framework of childish memories of times that are no longer and feels... Boring. A milestone, but one of a past that isn't connected to our days."
22.02.2021,9.0,"This is my first review for a movie so it is a short one. Yesterday, I watched the movie and I like it so much. The guitar solo scene was awesome. I am an electric guitar player, too. I wish I could play solo like Marty."
22.02.2021,10.0,"An 80's classic that still holds up tremendously well, Back to the Future is iconic from start to finish. This truly is a masterpiece in setup and payoff. Whilst some might find the exposition towards the beginning tiresome, it kept me engaged as I knew that the payoff was coming in the second half. The humour really is second to none, and the characters are genuinely great. They could have ended up being stereotypical, but they ended up working really well. The score is another fantastic element - it's one of the most iconic scores of all time. Michael J Fox is obviously iconic as Marty, and his delivery is really good aswell. The effects mostly hold up well, but they don't need to because of how strong the story is. It really is one of the most simple yet enjoyable films of all time. My only tiny gripe is the final scene with Doc Brown returning and taking them to the future. I think it restricted what they could do in the sequel, and feels quite tacked on and annoying. I know it is an iconic scene, I just don't think it really works at all. Still, this isn't a big enough issue for me to not give this the 5 star rating it thoroughly deserves. It's a truly timeless film (Get it? Because time travel) and I'd definitely recommend it."
19.02.2021,10.0,"What a great movie. With hilarious moments, cool time travel and the fact that no detail goes unnoticed, this is one of the best movies ever made."
19.02.2021,8.0,Back to the future was an amazing film then and it still is to me. A good time travel movie with some good comedy as well.
18.02.2021,8.0,I liked the film however it was unrealistic. That's not how time travel works! But other than that it was a pretty epic gamer movie fam squad!
15.02.2021,10.0,"For me,This is the one of the best movies ever Back the The Future is movie on time traveling. Time traveling has always been exciting and fun.I like the butterfly effect . The plot of the movie is really fun. I Couldn't believe this was a 80s movie."
12.02.2021,8.0,"If I had seen this movie in 1985 when it was released I would have given it 10/10 eyes closed, but since I saw it in 2020's.. one or two things seemed a bit ""mehh""... so giving this an 8/10.Don't be deterred. It's still a great movie and you'll have lots of fun watching!"
09.02.2021,,Back to the future is my favourite film. I really recommend to watch it.
07.02.2021,10.0,"Hey everyone,I just completed watching back to the future trilogy...Im amazed by the fact that this movie was made in 1985 and I just enjoyed it like any other sci fi of our generation. Its a must watch,what a great movie manAnd now I know, where does Rick and Morty comes from...XOXO"
05.02.2021,10.0,"This movie series is an amazing, nail biting, hilarious and fun adventure that you can binge watch! I've watched this one atleast 20 times so it's one of my favourites for sure."
04.02.2021,9.0,This is my all time favourite movie.Better than many present movies.Enjoyable pure classic
04.02.2021,10.0,"Everyone has already talked about how amazing and fun this movie is and I'm going to join in. I went in this movie with very high expectations with everyone saying how amazing it was and somehow this movie exceeded my expectations. This movie is just perfect!Michael J Fox and all the other actors are incredible in this movie. Fox has such a natural dynamic with Christopher Lloyd. Their friendship seems too real at times. Lea Thompson really delivers this performance of a thirsty teenage girl, Thimas Wilson perfectly sells this hateful bully so it was so satisfying seeing Bill taken down but Cristin Glover sells the film and his performance is a huge reason into why George has an amazing character arc.And now let's talk about the script because this movie truly has one of the best and most exciting scripts and stories. Everything is set up so perfectly in the beginning with the character's backgrounds, personalities as well as the locations and important informatiom all being established so well for the 1955 section. Not a single scene is wasted. Every scene plays a role in the overall story and everything is linked together and this plot of Marty trying to get his 1955 version mom and dad to fall in love is a perfect concept given everything set up leading to a very exciting climax and a great character journey for George McFly.Speaking of the climax, it's probably the best part of the movie. Mainly because the movie does a great job by increasing tensions and leaving you wondering if Marty will even return back to 1985. I mean, the plan should have been a breeze but so many things went wrong and you're alwaus glued to the screen as you aren't sure what's going to happen and this leads to an emotionally satisfying climax where George and Lorainne finally kiss and that 80s music makes it 10 times better and a heart-racing climax where it seems as though Doc will fail to bring Marty to 1985 but he does and the ending is perfect, seeing Marty's family all so happy.This film is just so awesome and gets better everyime I rewatch it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop what you're doing immediately, turn on Netflix and watch the movie. You'll not be disappointed. A must-see for everyone!"
02.02.2021,9.0,"Love all the back to the futures, however this one is my personal fan favourite!"
02.02.2021,9.0,One of my favorite movies so far!!! It reminds me of true frienship
31.01.2021,10.0,"Marty is a high school student who, by an unfortunate coincidence, travels thirty years into the past and prevents his parents from meeting each other. In order not to be erased from existence, he must now find a way to unite them and secure his own birth, as well as to return to his time.This SF comedy is perhaps the greatest classic of its genre. If there are some who have not seen it, at least they have heard of it, and references from the film have long been implemented in pop culture. Fast-paced, fun, witty, with top effects for its time, a multi-layered story that stimulates thinking and awakens the imagination, and accompanied by great music, this film aged well and is as impressive today as it was at the time of its creation. Great choice either for watching with a partner, for drinking with friends, or for a family movie night.9,5/10"
28.01.2021,8.0,"Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a typical teenager of the 80s, albeit a kid with a friendship with a kooky scientist / inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). One Saturday, very early in the morning, Doc unveils his latest invention: a time machine (fashioned out of a DeLorean) that actually works! When Marty is forced to get inside and take it for a spin, he is transported back to 1955. While temporarily trapped in the past, he manages to interfere in what would have been the fateful union of his parents (Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover). So now his problems are twofold: getting back to his own time AND making sure that his parents get together. Otherwise, HE won't exist!""Back to the Future"" is one of the great, iconic 80s films, a blissfully wacky time-travel comedy that gets a lot of mileage out of plunging the affable Marty into a different time period. Here, he has to learn how to blend in so he doesn't stick out so much. The ingenious script is courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and his writing partner, Bob Gale, which comes up with plenty of great scenes and some hilarious lines. ""Why are things so ""heavy"" in the future? Is there a problem with the Earths' gravitational pull?"" The period recreation, done on the Universal backlot, is tons of fun, the music score by Alan Silvestri is tremendously good and memorable, and fairly decent makeup transforms a few of the actors into alternate ""past"" and ""present"" versions of their characters. Although running a little long at just under two hours, ""Back to the Future"" wastes little time, managing to hold your attention while it gets up to its top speed.The cast couldn't be better. Fox is extremely engaging as our flustered hero, and Lloyd is just a delight as the guy who gets the ball rolling in terms of plot. Thompson and Glover are endearing, even if the latter can't help but inject some of his standard eccentricities into his role. Thomas F. Wilson is a riot as swaggering bully Biff. ""Why don't you make like a tree...and get out of here."" The supporting cast is full of familiar faces: Zemeckis regulars Marc McClure and Wendie Jo Sperber as Marty's siblings, Billy Zane and Casey Siemaszko among the members of Biffs' gang, George DiCenzo and Frances Lee McCain as Lorraines' parents, James Tolkan as slacker-hating principal Mr. Strickland, Will Hare as old farmer Mr. Peabody, Buck Flower in one of his many hobo roles, etc. Music star Huey Lewis, who performs the films' hit song ""The Power of Love"", has a cameo as a teacher who tells Marty that his bands' music is ""too loud"".With a high energy level, a large amount of humour that actually works, and excellent visual effects by those pros at Industrial Light & Magic, ""Back to the Future"" has proven to have real legs in terms of its enduring entertainment value.Followed by two sequels and an animated TV series.Eight out of 10."
25.01.2021,10.0,"Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics."
21.01.2021,10.0,"Back to the Future, directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, originated and produced by the great Steven Spielberg, was this highly inventive, and I quote, ""heavy"" film! Back to the Future may not have been the first film to take a shot at time travel, but it's the film that broke barriers, and holds up the most out of Time After Time & Terminator, along with other early titles. This film is so heavily guarded; a lot of people say it's almost a flawless film, with good reason. Back to the Future has so many memorable scenes, having this original style, that many film makers later tried to mimic.Michael J. Fox, has his first major role in a motion picture, and he puts on a phenomenal & energetic performance, making his character, as Marty McFly, very bold, and entertaining! His character development throughout the film brings a lot of an enjoyable wit and comedy, adding great layers, so we can really care about his character. Christopher Llyod, who is most noticed for One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest, put on a trademark performance! Chris Llyod NAILED his performance! He carried himself with this quirky & loud, yet brilliant and thoughtful attitude, that was admirable to all. His character development during the second and third act was the best out of all the characters! Thomas F. Wilson played a great, stereotypical bully, in Biff. He was a cliché character, and meant to hate, but he is absolutely hilarious.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale was ahead of it's time, along with some of the scenes and risks they took! He crafted a very intelligent and creative script, that flowed just right for the 80's, then flowed even better with the 50's, adding consistent tongue and cheek humor.The score by the up and coming, Alan Silvestri, had this magical, yet suspenseful, and even a few sad tones to it. This score was absolutely phenomenal, backed up with a great song by Huey Lewis & the News, That's the Power of Love.Overall, I can go on and on about how great this film is, completely understanding as to why people would call this film flawless. It is absolutely fantastic!!! With only one notable award from the Academy Awards, being Best Sound Editing, this film has a lot to be proud of, and A LOT of nomination worthy aspects. Robert Zemeckis set up the sequel perfectly, and if I was around in the late 80s, I would have definitely went to go support it."
18.01.2021,5.0,Watched this a while back and really enjoyed the start but quickly lost interest was probably a great movie but seemed outdated for me.
12.01.2021,9.0,"The concept of time travel is very well exploited, lovable characters and very interesting storyline. Classic"
12.01.2021,10.0,Pretty good movie. Story line is unique and it puts you into your own realm. Anyone would enjoy this if you're into sci-fi movies
11.01.2021,9.0,"17 year old student Marty McFly inadvertently sends himself 30 years back in time in mad scientist Emmett Brown's time-travelling Delorean. However, when Marty meets back up with Emmett Brown in the past he learns that his future is in jeopardy unless he can make his parents fall in love...In the main Back To The Future is a science-fiction film, but it also functions well as a romance and as a comedy (albeit to slightly lesser extents). The science-fiction element is wacky and crazy (which fits the narrative as Emmett Brown could easily be accused of both of those things), but whilst wackiness and craziness could carry a film if done right they won't make a film brilliant - you need a good story and a decent chunk of fun and Back To The Future wins on both counts. Although Zemeckis gives the film a light-hearted tone, the story of Marty's parents blossoming romance is handled surprisingly sensitively and is a romance you want to believe in (and that means a lot coming from someone like me who generally despises the romance genre).Christopher Lloyd is arguably the star of the show here and his over-the-top zany performance in this film is something that always sticks in the mind - Lloyd is a talented actor who has appeared in many good films and his infectious energy is always a joy to behold. As bully-boy Biff Thomas F Wilson threatens to outshine Lloyd with his thuggish swagger and bravado (this is intended as a compliment). It's a testament to Wilson's acting ability when you think how convincing he is in this respective role given that he is apparently a really nice guy in real life. Michael J Fox and Lea Thompson are good in their roles, but they don't quite make the same impression as Lloyd and Wilson.The film also has a slight satirical edge to it; the future fashion being poked fun of in the past (Marty's 'life preserver' and Marty's Calvin Klein boxer shorts which Lorraine believed have been personally engraved in his name) and the ridiculous idea of a 1950's actor being a US president in the 1980's - obviously this really happened, but can imagine it being far-fetched in the 1950's.To top it off Back to the future has some wonderful musical numbers and a pacey narrative which makes for an involving film from start to finish. Zemeckis has made some cracking films, but this for me will always be up there with the best of them. Back to the future is a timeless classic and if you haven't seen it yet then what are you waiting for?"
07.01.2021,9.0,"It's funny, has some nice shots in it and the story is enjoyable. Really enjoyed it and it still is a nice family movie"
04.01.2021,10.0,"What a ride this film is. Is there a better time travel movie out there? If so, I haven't seen it. This is how you make a sci-fi movie! Fun, off the wall and NOT COMPLICATED! This is the height of 80's filmmaking and perfection in general. Perfect soundtrack and score, perfect casting, perfect cinematography, perfecting acting, perfect writing, PERFECT MOVIE! I have never met anyone who didn't like this film and, frankly, I hope I never do. If you don't like this film, you don't like fun movies.A+MASTERPIECE!"
30.12.2020,10.0,"It's the best film i saw it in my life and i'll see
It has every episode about time and travelling in time really i advise for watching this super film in the world ."
29.12.2020,6.0,"While the storyline is truly interesting, this film is full of weird humor and tons of cringe. Almost all the dialogues and everything is cringe and embarrassing to watch."
25.12.2020,9.0,"The creativity of this movie is just spectacular. I caught it for the first time in over a decade recently when there was nothing else on, and being that it was the first time I had seen it from beginning to end in almost twenty years, it just blew me away, brought back so much nostalgia, and made me shed a tear at just how great it was. I just wish I hadn't seen it close to a hundred times as a kid going back to the 80s and 90s and it was my first time ever because even though as a kid it is fun and enjoyable, I'm sure if I saw this for the first time as an adult, it would be even more meaningful as far as filmmaking goes.It's just an absolutely brilliant movie that was so far ahead of its time in so many different ways and couldn't possibly be better. This is what a classic movie truly is, not the garbage the industry has been spewing out for the most recent many years that people try to parade around. Simply put, if you don't want to watch a movie over and over, then it's not a classic, no matter how good you want it to be on the first watch. Zemeckis is brilliant, and Forrest Gump proved he was no fluke.9/10"
22.12.2020,10.0,"Really love the film and the special effects. Characters are good actors. Scripting is also nicely done, and the film has never been boring."
16.12.2020,8.0,"This is a fun sci-fi adventure movie. They managed to take a fairly complex thing like time travelling and ripple effects through time and create a very lightweight and very easily digested package.It's a great movie that's shy of two hours long where a ton of stuff doesn't happen, yet there's nothing missing from it. All of the hype about this movie being a classic, and all of the hype about this movie being in the ""this is a movie that anyone can watch and enjoy"" tier is to be believed. 8/10"
13.12.2020,10.0,Back to the future is one of my favorite Sci-fi movie. There is no wasted scene. The movie has a beautiful script. Every character is shown by a technique called show don't tell. The characters are well written. The actors played their characters as well as they could.A legendary movie
13.12.2020,5.0,I do not think that someone who want to see something serious will watch it
13.12.2020,10.0,"A must watch movie for all ages. Very good story, very good plot and very good direction. This movie deserves a 10 star."
12.12.2020,10.0,"What is there to say about this movie that hasn't been said already? It's a masterpiece, absolute and total masterpiece, and even having watched it a hundredth time I will say the same thing. It's been 35 years since its release and about 20 years since I first saw it on the TV and I am still amazed how good and fresh it looks, especially on the big screen. Incredible score by Alan Silvestri, near perfect performances by Michael J., Christopher L. and so many others, fantastic script by Bobs and outstanding direction by Bobby Z., immortal ""The power of love"" by Huey ""darn loud"" Lewis & the News and the whole soundtrack - I love everything about Back to the Future. It's my favorite movie of all times and despite, I admit it, being a little silly and naïve it pulls just about right amount of strings in my heart and keeps me on the edge of the seat until the end every. single. time. Once you've fallen in love with Marty, Doc, Jennifer, Biff, Lorraine, George and all the rest of them outstanding characters you will not be able to live your life the way you used to before that movie came into it. Trust me. You may not be needing any roads in the future you're heading to but this movie you have to have along with you."
09.12.2020,10.0,"In terms of pure popcorn filmmaking, they don't get any better than Back to the Future, a charming, funny, and exciting thrill ride.Not only that, but this film both honed a certain type of blockbuster craft and was able to do the amazing feat of keeping the quality of the first entry all the way through to the third, delivering a nearly immaculate trilogy.Much like Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Planet of the Apes, Frankenstein, King Kong, and a handful of others, this is a film for the ages, especially for lovers of speculative fiction on the big screen."
05.12.2020,9.0,"I really like it and it was so fun, for your free time and enterteiment is good choice"
02.12.2020,8.0,"Like so many is Steven Spielberg's
flixs. Back to the future is one of my all time favorite movies
watching as a kid growing up"
22.11.2020,10.0,Sure it's not art-Housey or anything. But Marty McFly seems kinda cool. This movie is awesome. Introduced me to wonderful actors and the world of Robert Zemickis.
22.11.2020,8.0,"Back to the Future is perhaps one of the brightest representatives of science fiction. World classics, which will be revised countless times in the future. I didn't say the wow effect in 2020, probably in 1985 the film had a completely different effect. Of the pros, I can note kind jokes and hyperbolicity of what is happening. Well, the effects don't look bad for 1985. Even despite its simplicity as conceived, Back to the Future looks higher than modern representatives of science fiction about time processions."
20.11.2020,10.0,"As my title states, the Best Film Ever Made.
You don't need another long rambling review for a film seen and loved by millions. However, disagree with my awarding this best film ever made?You have to ask yourself one question; could it be improved in any way?Many great films could have been improved at the time if time and budget allowed. Some movies could work better with a different approach by the director, a more concise ending. A change to the score. Special effects, cinematography etc etc.But BTTF needs none of those. Ask yourself what could be done to this movie to enhance the enjoyment of the film. There is none. Everything is perfect, from the small details you only pick up on afterwards or by watching again (and again and again), a superb memorable score, the perfect leading man for this role and casting of other characters. There's no flab to the film. It gets from A to B (or maybe that should read B to A and back to B) without subplots and dead ends. It's written so well that in a different pair of director hands, would it be all that different?
I truly believe this film can never be improved.Not just the greatest 80's film. The Best Movie of All Time!"
19.11.2020,10.0,"One of the true classics of the 1980s. Everything about it is spot on. Bob Gale's DeLorean is inspired by the 1960 movie The Time Machine. Notice the time circuit colors of red, green, and yellow are inspired from that classic film. It's just such a feel good film and the lines are as quotable as any great film. It's timeless, PUN INTENDED!The film score is really what makes this film work and it doesn't seem dated at all except Marty's clothes but that's a large part of the charm of this cinematic masterpiece. I don't know of anyone who doesn't like this movie and if they don't like it, they don't know a good movie if it hit them on the head like Doc hitting his head on the toilet trying to hang his clock. LOL Simply put, I could watch this film over and over and over again just like traveling back in time! A MUST SEE FILM and I own the trilogy on Blu-ray."
16.11.2020,10.0,"This movie is just plain fun, and it manages that because of how Zemeckis approaches a plot heavy film. It's been obvious from the beginning of his career with I Wanna Hold Your Hand that the two Bobs (Zemeckis and Gale) loved to put characters with clearly defined characteristics through a puzzle of a plot with clearly defined goals to pull them through. The likeable characters are the grease that keeps the plot running smoothly, providing a key to the film's success. When the two Bobs were in film school, they were surrounded by others who loved the French New Wave, and they just wanted to make Hollywood films of fun. With Back to the Future, they succeeded just so completely.The interesting thing about Marty McFly is that he doesn't have an arc in this film. At all. He doesn't grow. He learns a bit about his parents but the knowledge doesn't change him. At the end of the film, he's exactly the same person as he was in the beginning. This seems to fly in the face of everything screenwriters usually want to put into a movie, but it works really well because of the kind of adventure Marty gets sent on. He is presented with a problem (being sent back in time to 1955 from 1985), and he needs to solve it. In order to get there he is presented with a series of obstacles that he must overcome, including his mucking up of his own parents' uninspiring and flawed relationship. That's where we get character growth, in secondary characters that have a direct relationship to Marty himself and his journey back.So, Marty and his older crazy scientist friend, Doc Brown, get attacked by Libyans at Doc's first successful test of his time machine made out of a DeLorean. The choice to make the time machine out of a futuristic looking car is a great one on the part of the movie. It allows for the time travel dynamic with exciting visceral thrill at the same time. It also allows for an exciting climax, of course. Doc gets killed and Marty barely gets away, accidentally getting sent back in time without any extra fuel (some plutonium), and needing to find a way home to 1985. Before he ever gets to managing the beginning of a plan, he ends up bumping into both of his parents as he explores this new, brighter, cheerier nightmare world that he must escape.The mix of his exploration of the new world and his discovery of his parents as young people is expertly intertwined so that we never feel like we're coasting without momentum. His break of the history that brought his parents together is handled quickly, allowing Marty personal stake in getting involved in his parents' relationship at the very beginning. The 1955 Doc Brown encourages this because of vague concerns about the end of the universe and some concern for Marty himself who's due to disappear if things don't get set right. The stakes are clear and make sense to Marty's character. It allows the audience to happily go along with Marty on this journey through time. It doesn't matter that he doesn't change. It matters that the audience likes him and roots for him as he faces obstacle after obstacle on his clearly defined journey that just happens to be fun at the same time.The clear line of action ends up forming and Marty has to balance preparing for the historical lightning strike that he and Doc will use to send him back to the future while, at the same time, trying to repair the relationship he tore apart before it formed. The normal expectation of character change happens around Marty's father, George, who can no longer just fall into a romantic relationship with the pretty Loraine, but he must earn her affection. That earning, at the ironic guidance of his own far more confident son, turns George into a better, more confident man.The puzzle-like nature of the plot, reminiscent of and superior to what Zemeckis and Gale pulled off in their earlier pictures, all falls into place marvelously through the movie's climax. The clock tower, established in the opening minutes, the bad starter on the DeLorean, the tree falling on the cable, the visual call back to both the famous image of Harold Lloyd from Safety Last! and a clock at the beginning of the film, and more all come together in perfect harmony to give us the cathartic release as we watch Marty and Doc overcome all of the challenges to complete their goal.The film has all of the hallmarks of a Zemeckis and Gale production at their most enjoyable. The long opening shot that introduces Doc's workshop is evocative of Hitchcock's opening shot of Rear Window, revealing key pieces of character and plot information elegantly. It's paced quickly, never slogging down in unnecessary details, always successfully pushing the story forward. It's energetic, fun, and expertly crafted. This is Zemeckis and Gale have a ball and inviting the audience along for the fun."
13.11.2020,8.0,Oh boy oh boy oh boy I could watch this and the whole trilogy a million times!
09.11.2020,7.0,"So for me, I never watched this movie growing up. I just saw it for the first time, i amediately figured why people love it so much. It's funny, has some nice shots in it and the story is enjoyable. It just wasn't as good as I expected, filming could be better and some little touches here and there would have made it a masterpiece. It just seems when there is no sentimental value, the movie is just good and fun and not amazing. Overall really enjoyed it and it still is a nice family movie"
09.11.2020,10.0,"Michael J Foxes best film ever made. I love the humour, design, colours and just the whole movie to be honest. It's flawlessly perfect :)"
03.11.2020,10.0,"I first saw this masterpiece when they played it theaters for Back To The Future Day on 10/21/2015, and have fallen in love with it ever since."
25.10.2020,9.0,Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd have the best performance of there acting career in this once in a lifetime classic! One of the best movies of all time and still one of the movies i can watch repeatedly until I R.I.P!
19.10.2020,10.0,"I don't think that it's possible to describe how great this movie truly is. It manages to take you away to a different world and a different time for two wonderful hours.Everything from the clothing, to the music, from the set design, to the acting and the jokes, just works. There isn't a single thing in Back to the Future that I would change. There isn't a dull moment. Even the more serious scenes somehow manage to be lighthearted.Most importantly though, this film just gives me a wonderful feeling. I found myself smiling for almost the entire runtime. I somehow felt nostalgia to the 80s and 50s even though I was born in the late 90s. It is rare that a movie manages to make you feel so warm and fuzzy inside. Back to the Future manages that perfectly."
12.10.2020,9.0,I enjoyed watching it very much and I recommend watching it
07.10.2020,10.0,The concept of time-traveling is great and the plot is so nice to follow. Characters and music take a major place in that show and enable you getting closer to the movie. Just watch it if you haven't done yet.
05.10.2020,10.0,"The definition of a perfect trilogy,everything on the 1st,2nd and 3rd is AMAZING"
04.10.2020,8.0,"Its a great movie made greater by Michael J. Fox.Funny and clever with incredible set pieces that transport you back in time as though it was yesterday!There are a few movies that seem to typify the 80's and this is totally one of those. Colourful, loud, stupid, excessive and fun, that's how I remember the 80's and that sounds a lot like this movie!"
03.10.2020,8.0,"A summer blockbuster popcorn adventure not to be missed. This movie is a classic. Marty McFly is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean and has to ensure his parents still meet so he can eventually be born. This movie is great. So happy that Marty was recast and given to Michael J. Fox. Words really don't do this film justice, you just need to see it. Great adventure with perfect blend of comedy and excitement. Will be interesting to see how this current generation reacts to this film as the 80s seem so long go for them."
29.09.2020,10.0,"I loved this movie as a kid, and I still do. The climax at the end of this movie remains one of the most exciting endings for any movie."
22.09.2020,10.0,"Back to the Future is a movie I finally Saw on Friday on Netflix. The Movie is 35 years old. Anyway the Movie is about Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) who is a high Schooler who is Friends with Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) who is shot by terrorist & Marty Goes Back to 1955 to talk to pass Doc Brown but he Runs into Biff Tannen(Thomas F. Wilson) who is a bully who picks on Marty's Father George. Anyway I love Back to the Future & I have seen Countless Parodies of Back to the Future like Family Guy's ""Meet The Quagmires"" which was Awesome. Anyway Back To The Future is great Movie & I Give it a 10 out of 10 Anyway See Ya ;)"
19.09.2020,10.0,"What to say about Back to the Future? A trilogy that animated my childhood and continues to do so with as much panache and reverence as it did when I first laid eyes on the duo of Doc and Marty. A friendship that shouldn't exist, yet the chemistry that binds them is uniquely special and fluently conferrable on screen.Not a Sci-Fi person? No need to be - this is packed with action, emotion and intelligence. It feeds the curious and demanding brain with complex twists and turns, and characters overlaying each other in a vast time continuum.These films are clever, sinuous; they are peppered with flashbacks and parallelisms, thus keeping you entertained throughout. Expect great one-liners (""Where we're going, we don't need... roads"").It's undoubtedly the trilogy with the most re-watchability in existence, excepting, perhaps, the original Star Wars tri.BTTF contains all the key ingredients you want in a great film, from great characters to great storyline and brilliant music to accompany and set the tone each scene. It had me on tenterhooks throughout, and I am not an easygoing cinema critic.I can't, can't recommend it enough. After watching all three films, your life will forever be richer."
17.09.2020,6.0,"The movie starts out with a cool premise and slowly starts to explore that premise and everything is more-or-less fine until about half way through the movie, but that's where the movie starts to fall apart. Things like unrealistic decisions by the characters are plentiful all throughout the movie, which spoils the immersion quite a bit. The acting also isn't great and several scenes had me cringing at the voice lines. The implementation of time-travel and the 'butterfly effect' that the time-travel has which is shown in the movie is also flawed and unrealistic, though they undoubtedly chose this flawed version of time-travel in order to create some false drama and suspense, so I guess it can be somewhat excused. The movie also has little-to-no humor or comedy in it... I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire movie, and it's not like comedy movies from the 1980's can't make me laugh, in-fact, I laughed several times at 'Good morning Vietnam' and 'Airplane!' and 'Police Academy' and 'Ghostbusters', so it's really just that 'Back to the Future' has no discernible comedy in it to be honest.So overall, it's a pretty sub-par Adventure film which lacks both comedy and realism, but is watchable if you've never watched it before. Avoid rewatching it though as it's simply not worth your time."
15.09.2020,10.0,"I will readily admit that I'm flat out plagiarizing (copying) the following review because this reviewer perfectly captured my own opinion and comments that I would say about this movie. The only thing that I might add, kind of an ""honorable mention,"" is to say that the two sequels were nearly just as good! Michael J. Fox is superb and when he's teamed up with Christopher Lloyd, they are an unbeatable pair.I want to thank the reviewer for this excellent review:""Back to the future is probably one of the best movies if not the best movie I have ever seen. This movie is just fantastic, awesome and flawless. The action and suspense of this movie still excites to this day. You can watch this movie over and over again and still be thrilled. Most likely This is easily one of the best movies ever made. A must watch movie for anybody, any age, even if they aren't a very big movie person. Not much more to say.The movie has almost no flaws at all, and will not disappoint anybody who views it. A true classic that will endlessly entertain anyone. Overall a truly entertaining, memorable and amazing movie with very few flaws. Ten out of Ten stars"""
13.09.2020,8.0,"Funny. Great acting. Good music. Cool 80s slang. Nice plot. A young man accidently goes back in time and must return to the present, but there's one major problem: he has to get his parents to fall in love again."
07.09.2020,10.0,I find myself watching it over and over again whenever I meet somebody and I am like what? You haven't seen back to the future?? It is my favorite movie of all time. You can watch it over and over again and usually pick up something new that you did not notice before. I love Back to the Future.
07.09.2020,10.0,"This movie is one of my favorite classic films, but for me I actually watched it in the theater when it first came to the big screen. It has always been one of my favorite for as long as I can remember. I have had to have watched this film very many times and recommend it to everyone!"
05.09.2020,10.0,"""Back to the Future"" may be the most entertaining movie ever made. It hits on all cylinders. It's funny, romantic, emotional and very, very exciting. The last half hour or so is edge-of-your-seat stuff. The cast is perfect. They all deliver solid performances, especially Christopher Lloyd. Lloyd hits the ball out of the park. ""Back to the Future"" is as enjoyable now as when it came out. ( I saw it in the theater at MovieWorld in Douglaston, NY.) It truly is a movie that never gets old. Honorable mention: Alan Silvestri's music."
05.09.2020,8.0,"I surely think the second and third movie are not as good as this first one, this is completely iconic and I loved it at first sight, it's easy to watch because it guides you through a decent story without making such a big deal, we're talking about time travel and it feels really authentic, funny and interesting, something that lacks on so many first movies of a whole saga."
05.09.2020,8.0,"However I've watched this movie so many times , I really enjoy watching every time ."
02.09.2020,10.0,I am just crying every time watching this movie. I can't express how perfect it is. I was a kid the first time watching and Marty McFly became my one and only hero. It's not surprising to know how successful it was in terms of financials and overall impact on people. Let it be one of the most popular films forever. Thank you.
30.08.2020,10.0,"My Favourite movie ever..i have 1st this movie watched in 2017.. upto now may be 5,6times watched.."
30.08.2020,8.0,"The ancestor of time travel, the day after the imitation of the textbook. Every time You look at Zemecis's script, it's like a perfect answer to Field's play-beginning and end, how to grasp the contradictions, how to cover the details, how to control the rhythm, and how the dog is a gorgeous, flowing double setting at the climax that still looks exciting after 30 years.Although the concept of time travel is not carefully dealt with, back to the Future is a comedy about youth, imagination and growing up, while science fiction is a gorgeous coat with many echoes in it. The story about time travel has a wonderful sense of balance."
27.08.2020,8.0,"I always thought this movie was way ahead of its time, and it still doesnt look too shoddy by these days standards, groundbreaking and an instant classic, lots of humour, action, and tension.
All the cast put in an excellent performance and a delorean as a time machine? isnt that cool ? Also hands down the best in the trilogy."
20.08.2020,8.0,"This film is a time travel film without all the extra complications that are found in more serious works. It's a straightforward and comedic crowd-pleaser with relatable characters and plotlines. As an escapist adventure, it is very thrilling and we get really absorbed in the protagonist's quest."
16.08.2020,10.0,"Every once a year (If we're lucky) something like this comes up. Pure brilliance. A killer script, memorably performances, iconic scenes,... an absolute must see even though outdated a few centuries later. This is what current CGI poofs lack. Swing, vision, stamina and a great script supported by visual effects instead of visual effects supported by ... uhm... nothing."
11.08.2020,10.0,Storyline is just superb. I Never seen a movie with such a entertaining storyline.Suberb acting. Momorable characters.A must watch!!
09.08.2020,10.0,"I first saw this movie way back in 1985 when it came out on VHS video. I rented it out from one of my local video rental shops and absolutely loved it. I watched it twice that night and again the following morning before I had to bring it back.
This movie is a great family sci/fi comedy that captures the imagination. At some point in our lives we've all wished we could travel through time - I know I have.
This movie has great adventure, thrills and laughs that should not be missed, nor should the sequels. A terrific all-round joyride that you'll enjoy time and time again.
In recent times I bought the trilogy on DVD, so as to enjoy the movies whenever I want, and trust me, I do.
I fully recommend this movie and the sequels. Both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are perfectly cast as the time travelling duo. So, what are you waiting for?"
06.08.2020,10.0,"I really enjoy this movie even now, despite it was shot in 1980s. This is a sci-fi film with memorable characters. In my opinion the movie is great, because of the adventurous atmosphere and humor."
05.08.2020,6.0,"I like the movie , and it's kinda good. I like it. The pacing is good, the characters are good., and everything is good"
05.08.2020,10.0,"For me, what makes 'Back to the Future' so perfect is the energy that brings you into the movie. It is a classic. 10;10."
01.08.2020,9.0,"The visual effects are outdated but rarely distract from act. My biggest problem with this movie is that it goes by too quickly, and that's arguably a good thing. The narrative is a little absurd, which is completely fine considering how self-aware, and comedic the whole movie is."
31.07.2020,10.0,Back to the Future is a perfect movie. Timely and timeless. Funny and action-packed. Unique characters. I've watched it 100 times and have no plans to stop
30.07.2020,10.0,"I've a history enthusiast so time travel films tend to be generally interesting for me and Back to the Future is arguably the best time travel movie of all time. The setting and years that the film took place I suppose could've been better, I think I would've preferred there to have been scenes involving 3 different years in this movie but just having 1955 and 1985 worked very well with the complex entertaining plot this film gives us. 1950's and 1980's USA are certainly not my favourite historical periods but they are both definitely interesting history periods so overall I really liked it and loved seeing the contrast and changes of the various buildings in Hill Valley in 1955 and 1985. It would've only made small difference in years in the film's time setting but I would've preferred Marty to have gone back to 1960 or the late 1950's instead of 1955 and had pretty much the same story with his parents except it would be 4 or 5 years later and that way they'd be more of a Rock n Roll, greaser and rocker culture in the past setting of this film, but that's just my personal preference.There were many emotional scenes in this movie, the film gives me some thought provoking scenes which makes me think deeply about my parents and love life, but for the most part in an emotionally positive enthusiastic way, especially as this film has a happy ending for the most part. There's so many emotional scenes in this film that it's too much to briefly mention all of them but most of them are emotional scenes involving a son and his parent or parents so if you have a particularly interesting relationship with your parents you'll probably find these scenes more interesting and emotional than most people, generally speaking.Off the top of my head, I can't think of any dull boring scenes this movie had, all the scenes are good and therefore the film is good from start to finish, the consistency of this film is brilliant. The film has a relatively slow start, but the slow start was necessary for character development to a certain extent. Some of the scenes at the start such as the first scene where Marty just walks around in Doc's home for a little while and the clocks start ringing and Marty's short journey from Doc's to his school are some examples of scenes that do make the beginning of this film relatively slow and relatively boring compared to the later parts of the film, but even those two scenes I mentioned were still definitely watchable and reasonably good in their own right.The plot of this film is flawless and epic. The chemistry between father and son, mother and son and friendships in this film will make you very entertained, if you're a history nerd like I am the looks of the various vehicles, as well as the old fashioned skateboards and diners from the 1950's will give you some joy. How this film has a young teenage boy pretty much healing himself and his parents whilst protecting his parents from a dangerous bully known as Biff Tannen 30 years into the past is in my opinion a very interesting complex plot full of emotion, facts and simple bliss.The character line up in this film is far from the best character line up in a movie, but most of the greatness this film has in my eyes comes from the film's plot, not the characters; the quality of the characters don't quite stack up compared to the quality of the film's plot. But the character line up in this film is still way above an average film, the only dull characters in this movie were the ones that didn't get a lot of screen time such as Marty's siblings and Jennifer, I felt Jennifer was a very under developed simplistic character for a character that's supposed to be the main character's girlfriend and she seemed to be a rather stereotypical boring unoriginal Hollywood Female character with no unique character traits of her own.The main characters though, Marty, Doc, Biff and Marty's parents were all above average characters, but they're all far from characters that are genuinely complex, well developed and sublimely unique. This film cleverly relies on the epic plot of the movie to make it so entertaining without having much in the way of great characters so really the characters never needed to all be great for this film to work as the turns the plot takes in this film makes much of the plot very relatable to the average person and therefore interesting and thought provoking."
28.07.2020,9.0,"Back to the Future is a good movie. The storytelling, dialogue, characters, and acting are all very amusing. It's very entertaining and interesting. It is fun to watch."
27.07.2020,10.0,"Growing up in the 80s watching a Movie was a special experience in most cases you were limited with choice as movies did not ever come thick and fast as they do today. But when they did come they brought something that is sadly lacking in many modern day films and that is a sense of amazement along with good thought out story. I am happy to say that this movie is the benchmark that I measure all other movies and ages perfectly due to the nature of the story. Christopher Lloyd, Michael J Fox,Leah Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson and Crispin Glover make this movie / Trilogy a joy to watch. I recall when I first watched it being fixated and even today if I see a delorian I can't stop staring. Robert Zemeckis directed one hell of a movie and that sound track is simply amazing. If you have not seen this movie then please I encourage you to. Get yourself a bowl of popcorn, Removed any distractions and give it the time it deserves and do so."
20.07.2020,8.0,"I had a pleasure to introduce the new generation of kids to this absolute legendary movie, even though it is made in the mid 80s the movie has aged well and I can even say that you will not be able to tell that this is an 80s movie. This is highly recommended for adults to share this with the kids of today and let them know about the crazy adventures of Doc and Marty. Top movie with a top cast."
13.07.2020,9.0,"I can't possibly understand how someone could not like the Back to the Future trilogy.The storyline behind this film is something that would've been very easy to botch in the process of transferring it from script to screen, and yet everything about this film works so well. It's extremely clever, endlessly funny and one of the most enjoyable films to watch. It held up extremely well over the years.Robert Zemeckis did a fantastic job in the director's chair, not only directing this film but also the other two in the trilogy, where he often does callbacks to this film in cleverly-done alternate angles of the same shots and, in some instances, alternate versions that are done so well they flow together harmoniously to create something that only ever improves the viewing experience.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd in the two leading roles are absolutely amazing working off each other. Without their chemistry, the film as a whole just wouldn't work, but they're both incredible, legendary actors who pull it off brilliantly.This is a rare occurrence where everything about the film, from the cameras to the actors, director, and score, just work. And everything comes together to give us this timeless cinematic gift that has been cherished since the day it came out and will be enjoyed for decades to come."
13.07.2020,9.0,"This movie is definitely a must watch the script the acting and the comedy is amazing Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have great on-screen chemistry
and the plot is so good that it make you want to know what happens next in part II and III."
12.07.2020,8.0,"Its a big thing to make a such script on earlier 1985 itself...really it was a gem movie of time travel..
While watching i was enjoyed soo much And laughed for some scenes too...
The protogonist acted soo naturally...
And story and screenplay was soo good and narrated well..."
11.07.2020,8.0,"The importance of ""Back to the Future"" in the science fiction genre in cinema is undeniable. Even though time travel was covered and gained great prominence in 1984, just a year earlier with the classic ""Terminator"", Robert Zemeckis' saga is innovative in several aspects, managing to become one of the best trilogies of all. times. The director was already reasonably known for some previous works, such as Youth Fever (1978) and Em Busca da Esmeralda Perdida (1984), which were far from critical and public success. In 1985, however, he would start to climb the post of a great director by launching Back to the Future, written by him in partnership with Bob Gale and produced by Steven Spielberg.There is perhaps no more fascinating subject in science fiction than time travel. The possibilities are endless. Go forward or back in time, see the future or the past. Is it possible to interfere in the past? What can this interference create? A parallel timeline? Immediate changes in the present? The paradoxes are exciting, with countless literary and audiovisual works addressing the theme in the most varied ways, with the most varied internal logics.Back to the Future manages to combine theoretical concepts about time travel with uncomplicated and uncompromised language that uses nostalgia as a strong binding element. The time travel that we see in Robert Zemeckis' impeccable work is a journey into ourselves, an internal conversation that, even without knowing it, we have every day.
The script by Gale and Zemeckis is extremely ingenious and does all this in a playful, light way, without relying on exaggerated, omnipresent special effects. It is an old-fashioned comedy with a touch of science fiction and not the other way around, managing to play with almost every possibility.Regarding the pace of the narrative, many comment that the film only begins when Marty McFly finally travels back in time after Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is shot by the terrorists from whom he stole plutonium to power the flow capacitor, MacGuffin from film that allows the miracle of time travel. Yes, without a doubt that Back to the Future really only works from that moment on. However, this is rather a prelude with an expository narrative that fulfills its function without causing yawns in the audience.
The construction of the text is millimetric. Notice the first image and the sound we hear. The ticking of hundreds of clocks in an irritating unison in a semi-abandoned laboratory. Marty walks in unceremoniously, establishing his intimacy with who he hoped to find there in what he calls, just Doc. There are a huge number of gadgets that make the venue the live action version of Disney's Professor Sparrow's home. We understand the profession (or hobby) of someone we haven't even seen and their relationship with Marty. We learned then that Marty is an excited amateur guitarist (who wouldn't like that super amplifier?) And that he is a very backward student who moves around with a skateboard. We see the fictional Hill Valley in 1985 in detail when Marty goes wild to study: the clock tower, the restaurant, the square. We absorbed the layout of the place, which was millimetrically calculated to expose the maximum in the shortest possible time. Marty has a girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells), and parents shy and exploited by a local bully, giving the narrative a sense of ancient history.When Marty then jumped into the DeLorean - originally, the idea for the time machine was that of a refrigerator, which was discarded for reasons of motivating children and teenagers to lock themselves in their refrigerators in order to travel through time. So, the choice for the DeLorean DMC-12 model was almost obvious - it encapsulates the time machine and drives at 88 miles per hour, catapulting on November 5, 1955 (the date is emblematic because, as we also learned in this prologue, was the date that Doc invented the flow capacitor and that he uses only as an example of the system he presents to his friend / pupil), the film changes. The pace slows down and we start to relearn what we already know, only with a look from 30 years before. Little needs to be said thanks to the initial 15 or 20 minutes. We get it all faster than Marty - or Calvin Klein - does. He is in the past and has just ""saved"" his future father from being run over, and with that, his future mother falls in love with the son he does not yet have, not with the future husband. The temporal paradox comes to a boil and the viewer's head begins to seethe with possibilities. And who can help? Of course, the 1955 Doc, the same one who, on that exact and fateful day, invented the flow capacitor without even knowing what it was for. A typical crazy inventor who lives in isolation, but who is Marty's only hope to return to the future (or to the present - or, for us, at that moment, to the past ...).Another decisive factor for everything to work fully is the cast. Michael J. Fox has an innate empathy, a way of captivating the viewer that made him the perfect choice for the good people Marty McFly, that ordinary teenager mentioned at the beginning of this text. For the public to travel with Marty, they would have to like him unconditionally. And that happens through the great performance of the young actor. It helps that Michael J. Fox has a partner to match Christopher Lloyd. Doctor Brown is the figure who explains the whole plot to the viewer without boring him with obviously expository dialogues. He is a nutty figure, without a doubt, but a guy you can count on and trust. We still have great performances from the supporting cast. Lea Thompson gives the common dreamy girl an interesting dubiousness, showing that not always a carola lady may have been prudish in the past. Crispin Glover does well to transform his character, a cowardly young man into a person who finally defends himself, in one of the most captivating screenplays of the 1980s. And finally, Thomas F. Wilson lives the bully Biffy Tannen, a boy who puts himself in the McFly family's way longer than he should - a role that grows a lot during the trilogy.
Another character that has no life, but is very important, is Delorean. A mobile time machine, a different car that was not very successful there when it came out, but that gained new breath after the success of the film. Much of the charm of Back to the Future lies in its time machine with the cage doors and all its flashing buttons. Last (but not least), we have the very small town of Hill Valley. She is, like Bedford Falls (from Happiness Can't Buy), a film heritage. The changes she goes through in 30 years are undoubtedly responsible for several highlights of the film. Built in the back of Universal studios, it gains an impressive transformation. In 1955, clean, beautiful, orderly. Thirty years later, time is relentless. Dirt, graffiti, depredations. It is possible to notice the great care of art direction in the construction of that environment, which makes all the difference when comparing the ""two"" Hill Valley.Remembered at the time as a bold visual effects film, Back to the Future manages to keep itself well in the eyes of today's audiences - with rare exceptions, such as Marty's transparent hand during the rock concert in the third act. But it is not just effects that Robert Zemeckis offers us. The filmmaker commanded one of the coolest action sequences of that decade, with Dr. Brown desperately trying to get a lightning bolt to Delorean just in time to send Marty back to the future. All of it orchestrated with precise cuts, a perfect performance by Christopher Lloyd and the unforgettable theme song by Alan Silvestri. Speaking of music, the soundtrack has good songs created by Huey Lewis and the News, an inventive joke with Johnny B. Goode, with Marty creating rock, as well as lesser-known songs by Eric Clapton and Lindsey Buckingham. The theme song composed by Silvestri is unforgettable as it evokes ethereal aspects of science fiction at the same time, with beats typical of the 40s and 50s series.Back to the Future is one of those productions that just don't age. The feeling of fun and engagement provided by the film remains the same with each new one. This may explain the longevity and the affection that fans feel for this adventure. In addition to success with the public and critics, De Volta Para o Futuro caused - and still does - enormous cultural impact on the world. In 1985, skateboard culture was still in its infancy in the Western world, and the film played its role in spreading the sport (Marty McFly was an avid skater). In addition, the DeLorean brand was never the same after the work's debut in theaters. The DMC-12 model made history as a synonym for the time machine, making it virtually impossible to dissociate the brand and vehicle from the adventures of Doc. Emmett Brown and Marty McFly.At the end of the day, the ""time travel"" theme is a beautiful excuse for Zemeckis and Gale to take us on an iconic journey through the 50s that appeals to nostalgia even for those who have not lived through the era. And, perhaps, the most interesting thing is that, today, when we look back in time - another time travel? - We feel nostalgia for the 80's that generated this and so many other magnificent films. Back to the Future is, in short, a great film that must be seen several times. With each new revisited in the work, we ended up discovering a detail that went unnoticed. Giving rise to two quality sequences, in 1989 and 1990, this is a very fun adventure, which interferes with the viewer's imagination while sewing its plot with each element being in place at the end. A film that has entertained audiences for almost thirty years, showing that it has stood the test of time. For a production that has its main motto in time travel, this is an essential quality."

IT'S A COMBINATION OF FUN AND SERIOUS STORY TELLING"
10.07.2020,7.0,Though the time travel concepts shown in the film is a out of date this film is still worth seeing as a classic in time travel sci-fi.
09.07.2020,10.0,"I love love love this film. This film is so very good. I can see myself revisiting it in the future, for sure. And I love Marty McFly. He's the best character to exist from America. I grew to be so fond of him. The biggest thing that this film makes one realize is that if you do something differently than what you're always doing take a risk, be braver, you can change the entire course of your future, and the future in general. Now, isn't that one wonderul story to tell?"
07.07.2020,10.0,"This is a wonderful mix of humor scifi and a touching ode to great stories like the wizard of oz teaching us how much family and home means. scientist be weary as there are many holes in the time travel theory but some truths about the continuum as well. wonderfully acted, written and directed with characters you cant help but love. a wonderful jules verne esque story for the whole family."
07.07.2020,10.0,"We watched Back to The Future after fireworks on the 4th of July as my older kids hadn't seen it in awhile and my younger kids had never seen it. Sometimes movies don't hold up and seems better for their time. that is NOT the case here as everyone thoroughly enjoyed the movie.It is a pure adventure comedy with great pace and timing. It is funny throughout and tense as the adventure tightens up. I cannot recommend this enough, especially for those families that haven't seen it, yet."
05.07.2020,10.0,"Everything is just right in this hugely enjoyable film which wins my vote for the best ever time travel movie. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd excel in the lead roles. Full of fun, laughter, excitement, cracking observations on 50's v 80's culture, and clever twists and turns. A real feel good movie that will leave you with a smile on your face."
04.07.2020,10.0,(Must Watch) This movie has to be up there with the greatest movie's of all time an easy 10/10 rating
04.07.2020,8.0,"This film is as good now as it was in 1985. It is very well played, although some of the characters drift in to caricatures on occasion, they're a little bit over the top sometimes.
However Michael is as cute as a button and his tiny butt is perfect in those jeans. You also can't help but love Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown, he plays the crazies so well.It's a great story and just good fun, a strike of victory for the little guys. Full of great humour and decency, something that is missing from a lot of films nowadays. I think people should aspire to be more like the world we used to see on screen and not like the films that show us what real life is, cos it's pretty sucky.An easy film to enjoy intently or just in the background."
04.07.2020,9.0,"""Question is not how question is when?"" - This quote makes the time travel a perfect.On the time of 80's nobody can imagine like this type of movie.Where time travel makes a totally sensed.But can you change your future through?? Let's watch the movie."
04.07.2020,10.0,"35 years ago this week, one of the best blockbusters (and movies period) was released. This is my top 3 favorite movies (whenever someone ask what my favorite movie is I always say empire strikes back, raiders of the lost ark and this film) this movie follows 1985 high schooler Marty Mcfly (played by Michael J Fox) who has hopes and dreams of being in a band and having a better life but his family life sucks, his parents don't like each other and it's invaded by Biff (one of the best movie villains played by Thomas F Wilson) and a friend of Marty's, a scientist named Doc Brown (played MASTERFULLY by Christopher Lloyd) shows him his time machine he made out of a DeLorean (the best movie car ever) he ends up getting in it and accidentally gets stuck in 1955 (where he accidentally interrupts his parents meeting and his mom has a crush on him 😬) and he has to meet younger doc brown to try to fix his parents marriage and get back home to 1985 and we have one of the best movies ever (movies like this are honestly not around anymore) first off, the characters are iconic (the chemistry and friendship between Marty and Doc and is heart of this entire trilogy) and something people don't talk as much about this the technical side of the film (it's masterfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, it's shot beautifully with shots that give me chills, it's has one of the best movie themes ever by Alan Silvestri) and this is a masterfully written film (it's a script that scene to scene is full of amazing ideas that are executed to perfection) and of course, this movie is just a BLAST to watch (it's never boring, its funny, it's exciting and it's a movie I can watch any day, any time. In fact, I watch this movie at least once or twice a year ever since I saw it when I was 6) in the end, such original and inspiring movies like this aren't made anymore (this is one of the main films that made me want to make movies and this movie changed my life) with iconic characters, amazing writing, a perfectly made film and just fun and has inspired generations of film lovers and filmmakers (including the guys writing this review) because it did actually that great."
01.07.2020,10.0,It's the best of the best! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU WATCH IT!!! i can't describe in words how good this is! (btw this is for all Back to the Future movies!)
30.06.2020,10.0,"The movie is fantastic. The music, Bob Gales writing, Robert Zemeckis' directing, Michael J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd's acting. The story is so good and it has a special place in my heart."
27.06.2020,9.0,"This is one of my all time favourite films, I was there when it was released and it's a must see but the only thing that lets this film down is Huey Lewis and the news, how in the hell did they get the gig for this movie is beyond me.
Their records were crap then and they are crap now, not that you've heard of them since the film was release, they have completely disappeared and that's a good thing.
Watch the film it's excellent, mute the music."
23.06.2020,10.0,One of those classic movies you never get tired of watching
21.06.2020,6.0,Yeah i liked this movie because it involves everything i want to watch in a movie. TOO GOOD
20.06.2020,9.0,"If you were having discussions about what is the most popular film from the 1980's, I can guarantee that 1985's massively popular Back to the Future will be one of the names floated around. Not only was it a massive hit with critics and audiences alike, I absolutely adore the movie. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Romancing the Stone) and executive produced by Steven Spielberg, this film is a near-perfect blend of science-fiction, comedy, romance, and action. It is also one of those rare films that children and adults will love. I fell in love with the movie as a wee child, and my father loves this movie himself. Maybe it is the intense charm and chemistry of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, or the excellent set design of what the town looks like in 1955, or perhaps that famous Johnny B. Goode scene-but whatever it is, this movie never grows old no matter how many times you watch it.Zemeckis and producer Bob Gale came up with this film's idea around 1980. It was floated around many studios, but they refused because they considered it too ""family-friendly."" Films like Fast Times at Ridgemont High were all the rage because of the new, more risqué way they delivered teenage films. After the box-office success of Romancing the Stone, Zemeckis now had the clout to get this film made. He teamed up with Spielberg, who also produced The Goonies, to get this film made. Zemeckis's screenplay was considered controversial and actually was refused by Disney because there was a scene where Marty McFly's mother had the ""hots"" for her son, but in different time periods of course. After all, Disney had its family-friendly image to protect. Luckily, Universal came to the rescue!The behind-the-scenes casting stories are well-known. Michael J. Fox was their first choice, but was committed to the popular television show, Family Ties. The producers were forced to look elsewhere, and they settled on Eric Stoltz. After several weeks of shooting, Zemeckis realized Stoltz was dreadfully miscast. His performance was too dramatic. Luckily, Fox had an opening in his schedule and signed up to do the movie. He was able to inject his own personality into the role of Marty McFly. Great Scott!It is the year 1985. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a skateboard-loving, guitar-playing teenager. One morning, he and his doggy companion go to Dr. Emmett Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) laboratory to play with an amplifier. He gets the call to meet the doctor at the empty parking lot of a local shopping mall where he confesses he discovered time travel...and his DeLorean is the time machine. Before Doc Brown can show off his discovery, he gets gunned down by some Libyan nationals. McFly barely escapes and only does so using the DeLorean...and ends up in 1955. He meets the younger versions of both his parents, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover). The problem is Marty interrupts their first meeting, which drastically changes the future. Marty needs to find the younger Doc Brown to help him set things right.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd show an amazing amount of chemistry with each other, and each of their individual performances are nothing short of fantastic. Fox really had a fun time and ""fun"" is the key word. He exhibited himself in Marty McFly. Lloyd is well known for his one-liners such as the constant use of ""Great Scott!"" and his wide eyes as well. Thompson and Glover also deliver in their performances. Finally, I really loved Thomas F. Wilson's best performance as Biff Tannen, the film's main antagonist. Gale mentioned that Tannen was modeled after Donald Trump, and yes I can see that comparison.In terms of special effects, they really hold up by today's standards. The visual effects team worked many, many hours to make the film look realistic as possible. The scenes with the DeLorean still blow me away. Or the ending scenes with the lightning and the tower...just fantastic. If you like musical scores, then you shall instantly recognize Alan Silvestri's renowned score. The theme is one of the most hummable ones out there. Spielberg actually disliked Silvestri's score in Romancing with the Stone, so Zemeckis told the composer to be grand. And we cannot talk about Back to the Future without Huey Lewis and the News. ""The Power of Love"" is one of the most popular songs out there no thanks to this movie.Back to the Future had many running jokes, most of which worked. When the DeLorean is mistaken as a flying saucer in the farmer's shed or people in the diner believing that Marty's vest is a life preserver is just several examples. Or I love to see how Marty's town looks different thirty years earlier. Anyhow, this movie is so much fun. It's a science-fiction movie, but it has enough humanity to it where it receives comparisons to It's A Wonderful Life. Robert Zemeckis went on to have an excellent career, but this is his masterpiece. It is a film for all ages. An unforgettable picture that knows how to have fun.My Grade: A"
18.06.2020,7.0,"I had never seen the movie before, but I felt that for the sake of a friend of mine who has always loved it, and because it has been so much talked about, that I would finally give it a chance. To my surprise I found it quite entertaining, even despite the absurdity of it all, and how corny it actually is. I even began sensing a similarity to Its A Wonderful Life, if not exactly in its plot, certainly in its warm hearted fantasy, and its use of time alteration, as the means of conveying a story. Unfortunately, I found the ending a little too drawn out. It seemed to attempt too much, and would have been better off with less ambition. Instead, it seems rather sloppy. Still, its mostly fun, despite its flaws."
18.06.2020,10.0,Arguably the greatest film of all time never gets old.
15.06.2020,9.0,"The theme of the film's expression is that no one's future is immutable, our future is in our hands, and we can create a new future."
14.06.2020,9.0,"Now the director is still copying the films of the 1980s, which is really speechless. But it's a pity that all kinds of behaviors of the protagonists back in the past are for the convenience of playing handsome and satisfying the audience's curiosity psychology. However, if we can use a higher level of skills and logicality to construct the plot, it's not limited to the scope of commercial films."
14.06.2020,9.0,"The most fascinating science fiction film of childhood. What impresses me most is the plot of episode one or two. My will saved me more than 100 years ago. At that time, I thought the law firm was too reliable."
13.06.2020,8.0,"There is no garbage time in the film. Every shot is connected. Although time and space travel is not as unexpected as expected, the correspondence between the future and the past is indeed just right, especially the love between parents."
13.06.2020,9.0,"At the beginning of the article, I was pinned in front of the screen by a long, still shot. The classic sci-fi film that was fashionable at that time seems to have a lovely tone of retro and pure love. I can't describe the feeling of being constantly struck by the familiar music and Bridge lightning when watching this piece. I have seen so many films to pay homage to it."
13.06.2020,8.0,"If I were to go back to the past, what would I do? Would I still want to come back? Every detail of the film is cleverly designed, which is worthy of being a classic work. Some passages are repeatedly imitated by later generations."
11.06.2020,7.0,Why do the filmmakers show the Libyans this bad way!??
10.06.2020,10.0,"I have loved this movie since it release and watch it at least 3/4 times a year. It never gets old Michael J Fox is amazing, Having a great baddie in Biff always elevates the star. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the Doc. The whole cast is picked to perfection. A pop culture classic that never ages for me."
07.06.2020,9.0,"Although there is no major stunt in the film, both the characters and the plot are in place. Dr. Brown's image is unforgettable. The trilogy's time is a little longer, but the content is penetrating and can be read in one go. This film can be regarded as another kind of inspirational film, the theme is that no one's future is unchangeable, our future is in our hands, we can create a new future."
07.06.2020,9.0,"The most amazing thing about this movie is that it makes me find that there are many movies born here. Magic imagination, crossing, parallel universe, butterfly effect, all start from this. In addition, the plot of science fiction also shows a truth. A little bit of the past can affect the present, a little bit of the present and the future."
07.06.2020,10.0,The back to the future series is possibly the best movie series ever created.
05.06.2020,9.0,(4.5 out of 5 stars).A lot of fun. Fun plot with an interesting concept of Marty going into the past and meeting his parents in high school. Funny. Entertaining. And the characters is a lot of fun. Michael J. Fox is great for the role. It does leave you feeling wanting more.
05.06.2020,8.0,"I've seen this movie more times than I'd care to admit and I love it every time. The characters are well cast and well acted, they have great chemistry within the main characters. The storyline is unique and well developed, there are so many details it takes a few watches to pick up on. One of my all time favorites ... you made a time machine, out of a Delorean?"
03.06.2020,9.0,"I just watched the trilogy for the third time I think, and I was surprised by how much this one was really funny. The other movies are good too, but this one is the best. It has a solid and simple plot that works very well. Definitely a classic, I gave it 9/10 only because, well, it's not perfect. But it's very entertaining."
02.06.2020,9.0,"Better watch asap .
I've been always hearing ever since i was a kid about how amazing this movie is , and as a kid i always thought it was a piece of #### but since I'm all grown up now it seems that this movie turned out to be my favourite so far and I've watched many movies befor so TRUST ME !!!"
01.06.2020,9.0,"This is my favourite movie of all time. I can not describe how much I love this movie. I cannot count how many times I've seen this movie. It's that good. A mix of sci-fi and comedy is overdone nowadays, but this movie NAILS it. Great characters, great plot, Amazing atmosphere. The absolute BEST soundtrack of any movie. I love every single thing about this movie. A must watch."
29.05.2020,8.0,"Although the film does not have any special effects, but both the character and the plot are in place. The image of Dr. Brown is unforgettable. The trilogy is a little longer, but the content is permeable and can be watched in one go. This film can be regarded as an alternative inspirational film. The theme of the promotion is that no one 's future is fixed. Our future is in our hands, and we can create a new future.Although the treatment of time travel related concepts is still not meticulous, in fact, ""Back to the Future"" is a comedy about youth and imagination and growth, and science fiction is a gorgeous coat with a lot of echoes in it. Through the passage, the sense of balance is really wonderful."
26.05.2020,9.0,"The greatest entertainment movie ever! A comedy can make my blood boil, it's just like tears! The script of this movie is a textbook classic. Never miss the greatest, positive, upward, fantasy and funny masterpiece in the history of human movie!"
23.05.2020,9.0,"Doc Brown and Marty McFly ... character names that are very well known in the Science Fiction movie pantheon I'd say. Any self respecting movie fan should know the names, the actors and the movies that made them famous. Which in case of McFly and the series in general ... could have gone in a completely different direction - literally.Eric Stoltz got cast because the filmmaker could not get Michael J. Fox - had other contractual obligations. This is very well known. That his movie girlfriend was recast too, because the original one wasn't available at first - that I did not know. But it's all there and so much more in the Special features on the discs. Just the beginning of the movie is quite interesting and intriguing, because especially back then, no one knew what this was about. Well apart from the title of course.Very funny movie that sets off something in the careers of everyone involved. Yes the time travel aspect has flaws if you try to apply logic and consequences of certain actions and how they will spin out and what they will do - a ripple effect that is not entirely seen .. which would have been too complicated anyway.So sit back, relax and enjoy a very entertaining and funny movie"
18.05.2020,10.0,"I don't know how this film can be rate lower than 10. Firstly, the plot is amazing, it has its own version of time traveling, it's one of the first film which in details tells how it works. Secondly, the cast is great, all actors did their work perfectly. Also the story has some funny moments and good jokes. This film became iconic one.
So, it's one the greatest Sci-Fi film ever."
18.05.2020,8.0,"The best advertising in history, lavender CK panties! Hahaha! From the perspective of time travel, something may not make sense, but it does not affect the whole story is very complete and very happy, ha ha ha, interesting ~ ~ the movie at that time, the rhythm is really fast"
18.05.2020,8.0,"It is said that the director originally wanted to shoot a scene of a nuclear explosion, the company did not give money, so the story can only be placed in a small town. There is no nuclear explosion, no laser sword, the director and screenwriter must only attract the audience from the details.
Wearing the ck underwear, the protagonist of the Nike canvas shoes returned to 1955, simply changed the name to calvin klein, and pretended to be an alien to scare his father to a dance with his mother with a Van Helen tape. At the graduation ball of his parents, he played a gibson casino guitar and played a johnny b goode, and finally came a fan brother's hands to string, making the 55-year high school students stunned, the protagonist said: ""your kids gonna love it. ""And the guitarist with an injured hand called his cousin chuck berry to let him listen to the song, and rock music was born.
Skateboard chasing this classic bridge must have originated from this movie. The protagonist was in the west in 1885, the director paid tribute to clint eastwood. I do n't know if Fujiko Fujio has seen this movie. The hero in Doraemon has also set a talent for precise shooting. I remember in a long story, Nobita also became a cowboy and rescued the beauty. When the person selling the Colt pistol asked the protagonist: Where did you learn this hand. Seven eleven convenience store, the protagonist replied. And we already know the protagonist's skills on the game console in 2015.
The first dog of the doctor was Copernicus, and the dog in 1985 was already Einstein. I can imagine how many dogs the doctor has raised.
After reading it, I knew how much the movie Westward Journey and the 90s used to return to the future. Even if the classic sentence in the Journey to the West is in heaven, I think it is not as good as that of the doctor: She is one of a million, one of a billion, one of a googleplex. She is my dream, and I lost her for all time. """
17.05.2020,10.0,"Micheal J Fox is the perfect choice for Marty McFly, if there are alternate universes I feel bad for the ones where Marty is played anyone else. He, and the rest of the movie, has a quirky, nerdy charisma to it. The movie has a very light pace and script that doesn't particularly harden the movie into a particular genre. The movie has extremely funny moments that show the contrast between a retro schoolhouse past and the eccentric and advanced present and the advantages taken because of it. There is no other movie with such a big ego like Back to the Future."
16.05.2020,10.0,Having rewatched the trilogy recently I have to say it's still as fantastic as it ever was. Great for a bit of nostalgia or even if you are watching for the first time
14.05.2020,6.0,Christopher Lloyd is becoming one of my favorite actors as I continue my journey throught IMDBs 250 list. This film is probably one of my favorites with storyline and has some pretty epic special effects.
30.04.2020,10.0,"Heralded as one of the most perfect movies made in cnema history, Back to the Future is a great blend of science fiction, comedy, romance, adventure and nostalgia. It's entertaining, engaging, funny, and a visual treat for all ages."
30.04.2020,10.0,"I can't think of a single thing wrong with this movie. It's basically the best thing ever. action, romance, twisty plot, adventure...tres bien, tres bien"
30.04.2020,9.0,"I have started to watch world classic pictures recently to grow my wisdom enriched with versatile gems of cinema! Back to the future is a type of a thrilling nd adventurous movie,backed with concert sounds....It's a movie about world's one of the practised idea 'time travelling'. But time travelling is nothing but a night dream for a boy called Marty at last...nd in the middle this movie is hyped with thrill when this boy meets his father and mother and finds them as youth as he is gone to 30 years back from his present time! So coming back to the present time is terrible but finally a well made journey!! Micheal J Fox is too good💗
Must watch movie for any children!"
29.04.2020,9.0,"Back to The Future"" to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming art of a newer generation. This film works so well because of the great story and the humor is great. The whole cast works together and makes a terrific film that will be looks back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.
""Calm down Marty I didn't disintegrate anything, the molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact - Yeah, well where the hell are they - The appropriate question is WHEN the hell are they""."
25.04.2020,9.0,"Time and space passed through the ancestors, and countless later generations copied textbooks. Every time I look at zemigris's play, it's like a full score answer sheet of field's play practice. At the beginning and end of the process, how to grasp contradictions, bury details, control rhythm, especially the gorgeous and smooth double line setting at the climax, it seems still exciting 30 years later. From the sociological point of view, this film can also be regarded as the epitome of American Society for half a century. Alas, life is like a fleeting gap."
24.04.2020,9.0,"A comedy film can see my blood boiling, and the tears are soaring! The script of this movie can be loaded with textbook-like classics, and never miss the greatest, positive, progressive, fantasy and funny masterpiece in the history of this human movie!"
23.04.2020,9.0,"I'm a little bit late to talk about this movie but, what can I do? So while I was watching the movie, I was having so much fun! The characters are so good and simple. I think that for a 1985 Sci-Fi movie this is one of the best things that you can have. I liked the creativity and the way that the story was told."
21.04.2020,10.0,"Not only is Back To The Future my personal favourite film, it would surely rank as one of the best family films of all-time, if not the best. The combination of a wonderfully creative story, perfect casting, great comic delivery and an incredible ending make for an astounding piece of cinema.As with all time-travel stories, there are some serious flaws of logic that you can't help notice (how did they know the lightning would strike at dead-on 11:04 and not in any of the other 59 seconds of that particular minute?). But these glitches are minor and are thoroughly overridden by the exhilarating story.Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox are the heart and soul of this film and these two men turn in performances that will forever be remembered by everyone who loves Back To The Future."
20.04.2020,10.0,"""Why do you call me Calvin?"" ""Calvin Klein is not written on your underwear."" Although looking at this movie in this era, you will find a lot of flaws, but also because there are too many imitations of the movie, so much less Surprise. But in such an era, the appearance of such a movie is a remarkable thing, not to mention classic."
16.04.2020,10.0,I love the Back to the Future Trilogy but the first part is still the best in my opinion. The second part is not as good and the third part is okay. First part always a win and a must watch if you haven't already.
16.04.2020,8.0,"Although the film does not have any special effects, but both the character and the plot are in place. The image of Dr. Brown is unforgettable.

15.04.2020,9.0,How can you not love this movie.... You can watch it a million times n sti never get bored of it.... Sooo beautiful made movie.. with such details n great star cast.. love it love it love it
12.04.2020,7.0,"The good thing about this film is that it is really coherent, from a timeline has been continued, the future and the past you really can't find the time of the flaw, and such a fine plot continued for three! (unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to watch the next two. Shame on you...) If you really want to marvel at the ingenuity of the director's ideas after watching the three films, haha, please carefully observe the bell tower, which is the clue and main axis connecting the three films."
11.04.2020,10.0,"This movie is awesome, it is a timeless classic. Michael J. Fox does a wonderful job at being Marty Mcfly and Christopher Lloyd does a great job at being dr.Emmet Brown. It has a great story and the jokes are really funny especially the Darth Vader one."
10.04.2020,10.0,"Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, Claudia Wells, James Tolkan, Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber, Casey Siemaszko, Billy Zane, J.J. Cohen, Harry Waters Jr. (PG)Irresistible time travel adventure comedy finds teenager Marty McFly (Fox) witnessing wacky scientist pal Doc Brown (Lloyd) successfully test out his time-machine-on-wheels, and then gets stuck in the past after inadvertently going back in time thirty years. Energy, humor and action to spare, not to mention plenty of nifty hardware and blazing special effects, but this is far more than a sleek wind-up toy of thrills; it also poses a fascinating rhetorical concept well worth exploring: what if you could meet your parents when they were in high school? The script by Zemeckis and Bob Gale is an amazing construction (despite the oft-parroted paradoxical plot holes), full of clever dialogue, twists and payoffs--that the project was rejected by Hollywood dozens of times before finally getting greenlit proves just how shortsighted the major studios often are. Filled with wonderful, near-iconic performances and Alan Silvestri's rousing music (not to mention Huey Lewis' catchy contributions--he also cameos as a teacher); lots of laughs, lots of heart, lots of exhilaration, as good a family film as there ever has been. Oscar winner for Sound Effects Editing.97/100"
05.04.2020,10.0,"Back To The Future (1985)' might just be my favourite film of all time. It's an absolute classic, endlessly rewatchable and utterly brilliant. Its story really is timeless, less focused upon its sci-fi concept than you might expect. Even though the past is recreated with a lavish contrast, the piece doesn't tend to revel in its part period setting. Instead, it keeps its focus firmly on its characters and the dilemma in which they find themselves. Marty and Doc are as iconic a pairing as there's ever been, each written to perfection and performed just as well. Fox is fittingly flustered, as relatable as you can get, and Lloyd is like a living cartoon, lighting up the screen whenever he appears. The rest of the cast are all great, too; almost everyone has a distinct and memorable personality. After a lengthy but necessary set up, the flick absolutely flies by. Its amazing finale is comprised of a series of satisfying climaxes; everything pays off in some major way. The affair is incredibly efficient in that regard, as it only shows things that are vital to the story. It squeezes as much tension from its set-pieces as possible - I mean, I still squirm with suspense during its clock-tower clambering sequence even after a dozen viewings. The movie is phenomenally well-made in general. Frankly, it's a masterpiece. It puts a big, beaming smile on my face and keeps it there right through to the end of its credits. If I had a time-machine, I'd go back to 1985 to watch this in the cinema. 10/10"
05.04.2020,8.0,Time travel movies are my favorite. Love the paradox.
05.04.2020,10.0,"Marty McFly is a teen living in Hill Valley who is called a slacker for hanging out with Dr. Emmet Brown, whom his principal says he should stay away from for being a nut job. His family is falling apart, as his father is bullied by supervisor, Biff Tannen, and his mother is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. All that changes when he meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, who reveals to the youth who is his only friend his latest invention: a time machine built into a DeLorean. However, Doc is gunned down by Libyan nationalists he ripped off to get the plutonium needed to power the vehicle, and when Marty takes it to escape, he ends up traveling back to November 5,1955, a date Doc put in while showing Marty how the time travel mechanics work, where he immediately puts his existence in jeopardy by getting his mother to crush on him, leading him to find the younger Doc in order to set things right before he no longer exists, and get back home, as the time travel depleted the plutonium.This is one of the cult classic films of the 1980's. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make a good duo in this film, Also, the story is great, as it has Marty trying to correct history after his arrival in 1955 causes the teenager who would be his mother to fall in love with him, and the action scenes and special effects are great."
05.04.2020,10.0,First time I watched this in 2020 and it doesn't get old at all. Amazing film from the very beginning to the end.
05.04.2020,10.0,"It's simple, this movie is the BEST. MOVIE. EVER!Everything in this film is awesome !"
04.04.2020,9.0,"Let's travel aayyyyy back in time when movies were built on story and characters and used technology to embellish rather than using them as the backbone of the film., In 1985 Back to the Future came in like a bang. It was a lot of fun, it was an homage to the innocence of the 50's and had some really cool science fiction elements.It propelled Micheal J.Fox from a TV star with Family Ties to a full on movie star. It was the big breakout movie that Robert Zemekis had been so desperately seeking ( I personally think Romancing the Stone was just as good) and it cemented writer Bob Gale as one of the screenwriting greats.If you haven't seen this movie yet, go stream it or better yet buy it. Back to the Future is worth more than a few watches and will becomes a mainstay as a feel good film you can return to over and over again.If you know this movie or grew up with it like I did, stop reading this review and go put it on. It's that good. 1985 seems like a lifetime ago when times were simpler and happier, and this is your chance to travel back in time with Doc, Marty and the gang."
04.04.2020,9.0,"""Why do you call me Calvin?"" ""Calvin Klein is written on your underwear."" Although looking at this movie in this era will find a lot of flaws, but because of too many imitations of the movie, it has lost a lot of surprises. But in such an era, the appearance of such a movie is a remarkable thing, really classic."
03.04.2020,8.0,"At any rate, in that age of limited technology, it was a miracle to produce something that was better than most movies -- now, like a time machine. The subtle contrast between the past and the future is a good aspect of the film, scattered with interest in the occasional flash of the plot, rather than the bomb-like arrangement. Finally, what attracts me is a philosophical feeling in the film: want to know own future, know is such future, how to change? Their future has been revealed, how to learn from themselves to catch up with the future? In the face of the open futur"
03.04.2020,10.0,This is my favorite in this trilogy. Else in my top ten of all time and possibly one of the best examples of the quality of film making from the 80s. When I was a child Back to the future captivated my imagination and is one if the earliest examples of why I love film so much. This film has a crazy history too and if you wanna see an example of lightning in a bottle this is it.
02.04.2020,10.0,This is a wonderful good time filled with great performances and lots of great laughs
01.04.2020,,"A properly weighed mix of blockbuster filmmaking & quality storytelling, Back to the Future is pure sci-fi delight that's as intelligent as it is entertaining and makes for one of the most fun, creative & adventurous examples of time travel subgenre. Featuring a lively concept, filled with interesting characters & packing no shortage of thrills, it remains one of the defining works of 1980s Hollywood cinema.Co-written & directed by Robert Zemeckis, there is hardly any wasted scene in this picture as it quickly acquaints us with its story setup, and establishes its tone with an instantly captivating opening segment that bears similarity to Spielberg's style. Every moment is accounted for, no residue is left behind, and once the main story kicks in, Zemeckis makes sure the momentum is never lost and keeps the interest alive till the end.The writing is no slouch, for it makes sure the plot is constructed in a way so that every action only develop the arcs of characters involved without deviating from course, compromising with its entertainment factor or slowing down its 88 miles pace. Further assistance comes from its era-appropriate sets, kinetic camerawork, consistent dose of action, excellent wit, breezy narrative flow, exciting score & fab inputs from Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd.Overall, Back to the Future simply takes its conventional setting & straightforward premise, refines each little detail as meticulously as it can, and never loses sight of its primary goal, which is to take its viewers on a highly enjoyable & incredibly fun roller-coaster ride. There are several shortcuts it could've taken but it doesn't, plus Zemeckis' commitment to improving every scene to the very best of his ability is a reason why it continues to impress even today. Strongly recommended."
31.03.2020,9.0,"Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd did a fantastic job in this movie. Robert Zemeckis did an excellent job directing it. The plot to the movie was really good, which makes it the best time travel movie ever made. It's funny and awesome."
29.03.2020,9.0,"An amazing movie with great set ups for stuff we will explore in the 'Past' yet it does feel like the ending drags on, when it could have ended more smoothly. Grade: A"
29.03.2020,,Back to the Future is a fun eighties time travel movie with some great humor but is dated. The movie was so endlessly parodied that it lost some of its charm.
26.03.2020,9.0,"The originator of time and space traversal, the textbooks which countless latecomers copied and followed. How to grasp the contradictions, bury details, and control the rhythm, especially the gorgeous and smooth two-line setting at the climax is still amazing and exciting even 30 years has gone. From a sociological point of view, this film can also be regarded as a half-century microcosm of American society."
22.03.2020,10.0,Best movie ever made so fun brilliant from start to finish all 3 of them
21.03.2020,10.0,"There really is very little I can add to an already PERFECT movie: perfect acting, perfect story, perfect effects, perfect music, etc. Many movies done TODAY wish they could be a FIFTH as good as this one. ""Back To The Future"" still stands pretty damn good against current fare. That's a testament of how GOOD a movie this is. If Hollywood ever DARES to do a remake, they will know in advance they're heading for a total failure.Nuff said!!!"
17.03.2020,8.0,"People who always complain about a bad life, in fact, always stay in the shadow of sadness in the past, can't see the beauty of the present, can't enjoy the joy of the present; or can't hold the present in the dreams of the future. The most important thing in life is not memories and the future, but grasping the present and cherishing what you have so that you won't regret it when you lose it later. At least we have it, we cherish it.
Life is a one-way ticket. Life cannot be rehearsed. Grasp the attitude of being responsible for life now. Those who are still in the past and imagining the future, don't hesitate any more. Only grasping the present is the ideal and only option. The future is now, and having today means embracing countless tomorrows."
05.03.2020,9.0,"This is a great movie. It has amazing acting and a great script. My only issue is that it never explains how Doc and Marty met. They aren't part of the same family like in Rick and Morty and they aren't close neighbors. Doc isn't a teacher at Marty's school and he's not a tutor for Marty. How does an average high schooler know a random insane scientist? I think they should've started the film with a flashback explaining it, but it's not that big of an issue. The amazing plot, acting, characters, script, and camerawork make that an easily excusable error. This is an amazing movie."
05.03.2020,10.0,My favorite movie of all time period takes me back to my childhood and even now in my 40's still a very good watche
12.02.2020,9.0,"""Robert Zemeckis remains the beating heart of modern science-fiction films, and if you want to find any reasons why then, I suggest you watch this instant classic for once, you will comprehend the legacy he has brought to us.""The first time I have ever redacted a critic was down in 2015, since then, I learned how impressive productions could change lives and start movements throughout the world. Back To The Future represents one of those films, such a powerful, inspirational, comical, heartwarming, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film (which, happily, could end up being top-notch of all time). There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinema history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be thinking about the reason of having assessed the film an absolute perfection score:First and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back To The Future follows the proper steps to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and ordinary moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains; therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson's 2005 Wedding Crashers, I daresay.Finally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and the streets, not forgetting the excellent pop-culture references introduced.The audience ought to congratulate Robert Zemeckis' mind and, also, the crucial support of his staff (one of whom was Steve Spielberg) owing to this masterpiece. The montage is proof that everyone who has an incredible imagination is capable of creating chef-d'oeuvres, delivering the audience such an extraordinary time. What is more exhilarating is the fact that then-president Ronald Reagan loved the film to the point that he used famous BTTF quotes, for example, during his 1986 State of Union Adress. What an achievement ladies and gentlemen!(90/100)"
05.02.2020,7.0,"Before time travel, the'80 s were a good time for nostalgia"
01.02.2020,10.0,"The Jew Robert Zemecki made this trilogy for the FANTasSEeA of time-travelling.
That is captivating the audience - especially the young ones.
With an interesting time-line it's very catchy to fall for that illusion and thus beLIEve in all That science fiction around Einstein & Co."
29.01.2020,8.0,"Back to the Future' smashes what it set out to do, it's a thoroughly fun science fiction ride. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are outstanding.The film is actually pretty simple, that's not a negative - at all. I just mean in general, the premise itself is obviously complex but it doesn't delve too deeply into the scientific aspects. Again, not a bad thing.It's an extremely well made film."
29.01.2020,10.0,It just has a heartwarming charm throughout the whole movie. The effects are still comparably great and for its time (totally intentionally) this movie is a real mind game!Loved all the time jokes just give me goosebumps every time I see younger Lorraine frothing over Marty.
25.01.2020,,"The reference source of time travel movies ... Despite the years passed, I still watch it."
25.01.2020,10.0,"Back to the Future is one of the best Films ever made, The Caste Filmography, Story, and every small detail is plausible considering the time it was made. I was growing up in Pakistan and still remember the excitement I had. Some of the scenes were censored in our country which I watched later in the years. I think it's one of the Films, I can watch again and again and will have the same fun as to watch it for the first time."
23.01.2020,9.0,"Back when this movie just came out, it was one of the early science fiction movies that captivated my imagination. This was one of the first movies that made me reflect on time travel; as incredible as it might seem, the Big Bang Theory made me wonder if this movie is as far fetched as it might seem.Overall, I was very entertained by this movie, never a dull moment!"
17.01.2020,8.0,"Always delightful sciency yarn that has stood the test of time a lot better than most comedies from the same decade.I find being mostly set in a year before you are made really helps you in that field for some reason (just check out Kind Hearts and Coronets).A great, fast moving plot filled with Marty inventively navigating a minefield situation will be a delight again and again and one can't help but be rather fascinated with its audacious depiction of genetic sexual attraction. I'm not as into it as I suspect a lot of shirt haired students of gender studies are but I enjoy how much they probably enjoy it.Really feel good stuff that earns its status as feel good stuff and always visually pleasant. Don't take it too seriously and you won't regret giving this the time."
13.01.2020,9.0,Back to the future Marty! Let's go Doc! Yeehaaaaaaaaa deloreaann
05.01.2020,10.0,I loved this film. It had a lot of excellent action as well as animation and It felt like as if I were going to the future. 10/10.

31.12.2019,4.0,"I digged this movie as a kid. It was crazy scientists and fun action. And nobody could envision what the future would look like. Now, I'm in my fourties, the era they travelled to has passed, and I watched this again.First, nothing in this movie feels realistic. The family of Marty feel like a bad fever dream of a horrific past. Caricature dynamics that hammer in how crap of a life the ""kid"" has (Michael J. Fox was in his middle thirties at he time). The professor angle, well, nobody over 10-years old buy into that guy. He build a fantastical time machine out of a car for crissakes, an doesn't seem to understand anything about how something works, except through magic and unbelievable ""epinaphies"". They have an adventure, albeit, magical in nature, and learn a thing or two (banal) things about life. It's filmed really good, the actors are for the most part ok, but the story doesn't really make any sense if your'e not a kid born in the eighties with poor understanding of physics and science."
30.12.2019,5.0,"It's fine. It's mass appeal done right, if not exemplary. And that's the slant - it feels like it was formulaicly designed to have as much mass-audience appeal as possible. Much like Indiana Jones or the MCU, this tries to take you back to those Saturday Morning Cartoons - hip young teen and his mad scientist friend and their time-travelling rock'n'roll misadventures. Oh, watch out, they have to jump-start Doc's time-machine Delorean (in earlier drafts it was a refrigerator) just in the knick of time as lightning strikes the clock tower in the town square. This movie basically demands that you watch it in your pajamas while eating cereal. The production, direction, and pace are all fine. Michael J. Fox is hilariously bad and Christopher Lloyd is clearly having fun in his over-the-top madcap role. It's a serviceable diversion, but the problem with pop-culture is that it's elevated this movie way too far above its lot."
30.12.2019,10.0,"The pace and story telling is very engrossing, it still puts me on edge even when i watch it again for the X time"
28.12.2019,6.0,"Even though it's a fun ride, I can't say I'm a huge fan of it. Had I seen it as a kid the nostalgia would probably carried into today and I would appreciate it more. But the fact is that it hasn't aged as well as some other 80's movies. It's manly the slapstick elements that don't hold up in my opinion. But I still liked Fox and Lloyd as Marty and Doc and the time travel concept is fun as always."
24.12.2019,10.0,"It's a classic.It's another iconic film from the 80s.I remember when it came out, before I'd seen it... ""What does it mean... Back to the future?!?!"" I'd say.."
22.12.2019,9.0,"Back to the future is a science fiction movie and first part of the Trilogy. The movie is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson and Claudia Wells.To be honest this is a perfect movie to watch for which has everything in it, be good acting, story line, plot or the screenplay it will not let you get bored for a micro second and you will feel as if you are on a roller coaster ride.Doc and Marty are undoubtedly the show stealers with good acting from rest of the cast.A must watch if you haven't watched it yet."
19.12.2019,8.0,"This has been one of my favorite films since I was young. I even read a book about the back to the future movies. I used to own it on VHS so I have watched it a lot. It never gets old. It never gets stale. I wish I remembered the first time I saw it and what my reaction was to back to the future.I have always thought the Delorean is cool in the movie. Its the Gull-wing doors that make me smitten with the car. And it looks so wonderful in the movie packed with gadgets. What a car.The sound track is also one of my favorite movie sound tracks. The Huey Lewis songs on the back to the future sound track are fantastic.I also liked all the cast. My favorite was Michael J. Fox as Marty Mcfly. He was so entertaining to watch.Back to the future has it all. A great car, a great soundtrack, and a great cast. Its a great movie for a rainy day. Or if you want two hours of nonstop entertainment. By the end of the movie I always feel better."
17.12.2019,9.0,Having nice plot ...nice story...having great screenplay...go for it you will definitely going to enjoy it's all three part...fully enjoyment movie....every things in it is nice...it is totally family and sci-fic movie
06.12.2019,10.0,Back to the future is an absolute classic. The humor and fine details make this movie excellent.
03.12.2019,9.0,"A topic which has always been in human minds became a revolution in film history: time travelling. Amusing entertainment, one of Robert Zemeckis' best!"
29.11.2019,9.0,"If only we had this in reality ?- ""TIME TRAVEL""
Man! that is what this movie made me think of.
Fox's acting along with Lloyd is good. Great concept executed in good manner.Must watch! Will watch any number of sequels."
24.11.2019,9.0,"Perhaps the best kid time traveling adventure film of all time with iconic duo with great chemistry,the best part is that even today it still holds up pretty well with some little nitpicks that could be removed from final version but back to the future is still one of most enterteining films that were ever made and make it in really good watch"
22.11.2019,8.0,"Really enjoyed, Loved to see how will be when someone go back to the future"
18.11.2019,8.0,"This is one of the most remarkable trilogies of the 1980s. Even those who have never seen the movies know or have heard of them. In the first movie, teenager Marty McFly helps his friend, ""Doc"" Emmett Brown, a half-mad scientist, in his experiments with a time machine built from a DeLorean. But after a few adventures, Marty becomes the first time traveler by accident and gets involved in the midst of her own parents' romance in the 1950s. Now she'll need all the help she can to make sure. back in 1985, that his parents are married and that he himself will exist in the future.The film cleverly blends sci fi and comedy. Robert Zemeckis can make things work perfectly by designing a lightweight movie that can entertain and make you laugh, but still smart enough to appeal to the most demanding audiences. The film never tries to be credible or scientifically accurate, nor is it required as it is clearly a comedy. The cast, in turn, is absolutely dominated by the excellent partnership of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, with a series of memorable dialogues in between. Both actors here have probably achieved the most notable roles of their careers. The other actors contribute perfectly.Special effects, visuals and sound are inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie and here they work quite well. The soundtrack has also become iconic. In fact, the entire film has gained classic status, to the point that the film has been preserved as part of American cultural memory. For me personally, it is one of the most remarkable films of the eighties, which has aged very well and still has class, charm and style today."

20.10.2019,10.0,Wonderful movie. Takes me to magical feeling and attain the most and best of what you could ever want in a movie. Just perfection.
14.10.2019,9.0,I watch this 3 parts of this movie back to the future 1 and 2 and 3 more than 12 times
06.10.2019,8.0,One of the best movie of it's time but not 4 now cuz there are so much better movies
26.09.2019,10.0,"I have all three of the films on DVD and watch them all the time. My mom showed it to me when I was young and I became obsessed! This movie brought me into the world of fun sci-fi films and they are now some of my favorites. The acting is great and introduced me to some great actors, who I still follow their work to this day. These movies are in my top 3 it's definitely a must see!!"
22.09.2019,9.0,"Many of the finest time travel films deal with - and overcome- the mistakes or mistakes of the past. Frequency, a more latest time-bending film, deals with an orphaned son who fears not to live up to the expectations of his father; Back to the Future plays with his parents ' filial disappointment or disillusionment.On the surface, Marty McFly (in a physically and comedically deft performance, Michael J. Fox) has sufficient reason for disappointment: for his over-losing parents (and brothers) he seems far too cool, although he does not know how he really is the son of his father.But when a time travel experiment organized by Marty's friend Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in an Einstein-esque fright wig) leaves Marty stranded in the 1950s, Marty finds a side he never knew of his parents.The story is so tightly planned, with almost everything setting up something else and it pays off, that especially after numerous viewings, the first half can come off a bit gimmicky and artificial. But the last act is so overwhelmingly satisfying that it makes up more than any artificiality or artificiality.Although the film takes for granted unchaste conduct as the norm among adolescents both in the 1950s and today, Marty's dismay at the unexpectedly risky conduct of his mother indicates, ironically, that despite everything else, kids still want their parents to have a greater standard.The filmmakers followed up with a couple of back-to-back sequels initially designed as one film and that way should have been left.Part II is highly uneven, with a wonderful third act in which Marty returns to 1955 partially compensating for a wobbly opening, set in the future, and excessively nasty middle act set in a 1985 alternative. Part III is a bit loose in the old west and has some gaping holes in the plot. They might be worth watching once or twice, but it's worth going back to the original again and again."
11.09.2019,5.0,"I cant believe that all these years gone, but what happened in the movie did not happened in the real life."
10.09.2019,,"Back to the future was a massive hit and it is surely one of the most popular and famous sci-fi films ever made. The premise is simple but well executed, and with the character presence of Michael J Fox, director Robert Zemeckis made a crowd pleaser that is still recalled to this day. Back to the Future is played neither entirely seriously nor entirely for laughs, and therein lies the nature of its success. It's funny and breezy but doesn't descend to a level where the characters are little more than props for jokes. We believe in Marty, like him, and root for him to succeed. Part of the reason for that is Michael J. Fox. Back to the Future is unapologetically lighthearted and upbeat - a tonic for a weary movie-going society. Like Spielberg, Zemeckis has a keen understanding of how to blend diverse elements of comedy, action, adventure, and drama into concoctions that win over audiences. Marty's story could easily have been suspenseful, purely comedic, or a three-hankie melodrama, but Zemeckis found the balance and employed it."
05.09.2019,10.0,"This is one of the most perfect movies I've ever seen! Every scene has a purpose and is entertaining. You literally could show each scene as a movie in and of itself. The effects are great, the characters are great and the story is great. What more can be said?? If only the 2nd and 3rd movie were as great. If only..."
01.09.2019,9.0,"This movie is your typical 80s movie plot, but they make it so easy to use a time machine. But I don't think it is.Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd have some great chemistry.Overall a solid 80s Movie."
20.08.2019,8.0,"Well i didn't know that 80's movies could be fantastic like this one, before watching the movie i was thinking it would just nice as it is in 1980 but damn seriously, this movie was epic, the characters and concept of this movie are just brilliant. Movie contains lots of emotions.Acting of Michael J. Fox is just wonderful and other people done well too. It's really a great movie of 80's and it's extremely fascinating. There are so many pleasant scenes and lots comedy scenes as well. The thing that admired my soul is the conclusion of this move which was great."
13.08.2019,10.0,I've watched this about a million times and also the other two films. I like the story in the trilogy and the music composed by Alan Silvestri. The emotion in the films are classic. Marty and Doc are the greatest duo and the best of friends. Michael J. Fox was excellent playing Marty and Christopher Lloyd as Emmett Brown. Lea Thompson was cute playing Lorraine. Tom Wilson was hilarious as Biff Tannen. I saw online about the cast being reunited for the 30th anniversary panel of Back to the Future.I love some time traveling films but this one and the last two will be the greatest classic films to me.
13.08.2019,10.0,"Back to the Future stars Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Lea Thompson and is directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg. The film follows Marty McFly as he has traveled to 1955 and must find a way to travel back to 1985. This is without a doubt the best time travel movie in the history of time travel movies. I love the imagination that it took Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis came up with in creating this masterpiece. I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored with it. This is how you do a time travel movie. If you want to make a good time travel movie all you need is a good screenplay, music, special effects, acting, the whole nine yards. And this movie delivers and makes time travel sound easy as it breaks it down simple for the audience to understand. Back to the Future makes me want to go to back to a time where everything was simple that we didn't have smartphones or technology that we have now. This is how you do a science fiction movie without being confusing for the audience. I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored out of my skull. It also makes me want to go to in time when I haven't even heard of this movie and tell my future self to explore this masterpiece. So in the end, if you haven't seen Back to the Future do yourself a favor and watch this film and prepare to be blown away."
13.08.2019,10.0,"A classic nostalgic movie,a masterpiece of time travel, seeing all the effects of him going back was amazing,After watching endgame I had to watch this movie again just to get some real well thought out logical time travel this movie is a classic and introduced time travel the way it is today to hollywood"
08.08.2019,10.0,"I love the story line, for a young viewer I was kept entertained and on the edge of my seat. All around amazing movie!"
05.08.2019,9.0,"This was a great idea for a movie! I really enjoyed watching it and it was amazing, I recommend anyone to watch Back to the Future as it is very fun and interesting."
03.08.2019,10.0,I could watch this movie over and over and over and not be bored by it. It is too bad that Crispin Glover left the movie series.
29.07.2019,8.0,This is not only a classic movie but it is epic. Even after all these years it still holds up very well.
28.07.2019,10.0,"I don't know a single person who doesn't like Back to the Future. It is such an epic trilogy! I am a huge fan of time travel. I think the very concept is intriguing and awe-inspiring. And Back to the Future parts 1 and 2 are my favourite time travel films. In fact, they're some of my favourite films ever, period. BTTF does an incredible job at explaining how time travel works without making it overly complicated. It is just so much fun and super rewatchable - I could watch both movies over and over again and never get bored. The music is amazing too, and I'd say this movie has one of the most memorable film scores of all time."
27.07.2019,3.0,"Eh, a decent concept with a decent story. but filled with old-movie-qualities. so many dumb moments. barely funny (about 1 viewing)"
15.07.2019,10.0,"This is an absolute timeless classic of a film, I've no idea how many times I've seen it but it will never get old. It was released over 30 years ago and has clearly stood the test of time. I have nothing bad to say, I can think of no flaws. The acting, music, background, casting, it's all perfect. Yet another masterpiece brought to you by Stephen Spielberg (has he ever made a bad film?!)"
15.07.2019,10.0,Always wanted to watch this movie and never decided to do it until now. Great movie.
11.07.2019,10.0,"""Steven Spielberg remains the beating heart of modern science-fiction films, and if you want to find any reasons why then, I suggest you to watch this instant-classic movie at once, you will comprehend the legacy he has brought to us.""The first time I have ever redacted a critic on this website was down in 2015, since then I learned impressively how productions could change lives and start movements throughout the world. Back to The Future represents one of those motion pictures: such a powerful, inspirational, comical, encouraging, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film, which, by the way, could end up being top-notch of all time. There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinematic history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be wondering about the reason why I consider it as pure perfection. First and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back to The Future follows the proper steps in order to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping for. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and average moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win, basically, the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains, therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as a Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson relationship in Wedding Crashers (2004), I daresay. Finally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and at the streets, not forgetting the genuine pop-culture references introduced.In conclusion, Steven Spielberg's mind is proof that everyone is capable of creating instant classics, delivering the audience such an awesome time. (100/100)"
10.07.2019,10.0,Remembering when Back to the Future was in it's big revival under the 30th anniversary.
08.07.2019,10.0,"I have watched this 1985 film classic Back to the Future several times now and I have never grown tired of it. Not only does it stand the test of time (no pun intended) but this family adventure just keeps getting better and better, My three sons grew up watching it with me and in the next few years into the future our first grandson will also be old enough to enjoy this treasure trove of a film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make every minute ""a must see"" with the worlds destiny imminently at stake. Added to the quality of the cast are Marty McFly's parents played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover, and I just loved the films' buffed bully Biff Tannen played to perfection by Thomas F. Wilson,This is certainly one of the top 100 films of the second half of the twentieth century in film making and an all time film classic to ensure Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's legacy as bona fide film stars.A perfect 10 out of 10 rating!!!!!"
06.07.2019,10.0,I really can't add any insight into this classic that hasn't already been said thousands of times. Classic movie that everyone must see!
23.06.2019,10.0,"Back To The Future has not become a classic without reason. It's an engaging time travel adventure with high entertainment value without being gimmicky.The intereaction between the 1985 Marty McFly and the '55 environment is so well written with lots of wit and heart that you can't help guessing what will happen next and what consequences could happen. And the writers knew that, so they put in some dillemmas and suspenseful moments which rids the movie from any dull moments and keeps the audience's attention throughout.The two central roles of Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown played by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd respectively are so good! Memorable in every way even if their characterizations sound generic at first, they just play them out so well you can't dislike them. Seeing Marty's family and acquaintances in the past is also a whole lot of fun.Good music, a well written script, great performances, good pacing and an instant classic is secured to delight everyone."
21.06.2019,8.0,"Whew! What a brilliant film that is bound to be a classic for generations to come. It just feels so unique, and the plot is complicated and yet thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Kids and adults alike will love this film, I recommend it to all!"
15.06.2019,8.0,"Great Scott! Finally managed to watch the quintessential 80s flick that combines a plethora of genres to generate an astounding 1.21 gigawatts. Enough to make me want to go back in time and watch it again. Damn. Damn damn! Now, it's no surprise that Zemeckis' most accessible film is the one that has stood the test of time. Spielberg matching him with this project was seemingly fate, and in the process they had created a pop culture phenomenon that contributed massively to many childhoods. A teenager, who documents a time travelling experiment with an eccentric scientist, accidentally travels back in time to which he must repair history and return to the correct year.With Zemeckis' overwhelming contribution and Gale's stellar writing, they had amalgamated an absurd amount of genres into one adventure. Primarily a romantic comedy with the aesthetics of a science-fiction adventure packed with arresting action set pieces. A whimsical invention that perfectly balanced a variety of tones, resulting in an instant classic. Embedding various intricacies within its script, from the clock tower donation fund to the flux capacitor revelation, that you subconsciously start to cling onto every line of dialogue. Every word is so important in its foreshadowing, that it progressively enhances the enjoyment of its story.It has to be said that the execution of some of these moments were heavy-handed (in case we missed anything...) and the paradoxical nature of its time travel premise was frequently brushed over. But the purposefully engaging characters and plot are able to distract us from these loopholes that sci-fi features commonly fall into. Although the final ten minutes wrapped up far too neatly for my taste, considering Doc went against his own words of advice.Speaking of good ol' Doc Brown, Lloyd's performance was the highlight for me. Capturing the eccentric personality of his character perfectly, from the exaggerated facial expressions to the excitable scientific mumbo-jumbo that he blurts out. He is just as memorable as the pimped out DeLorean. Fox, again, was perfect casting for Marty McFly, the flyest kid in town with his hardcore skateboarding skills hanging onto the back of vehicles. Comedic timing was exquisite and the more dramatic moments involving his past younger mother and father were well handled by him. Glover deserves some praise also, no longer will I class him as the ""creepy thin man"" from 'Charlie's Angels'. He is George McFly, author extraordinaire and my new personal hero for decimating Biff with one punch. Now, Biff for me was too one-dimensional to have a lasting impression, and became a forced plot device just so that the film had an antagonist of some sort. Personally, it didn't need one. Exclude him, or grant him some development time, and the story would've benefited from those alterations.It must be said that Silvestri's grand score accompanied the joyous onscreen shenanigans stupendously, and certainly had that Spielberg flair found in most Amblin productions despite the small scale drama. Oh, and ""The Power of Love"" is banging. All this time, and I didn't know it was associated with this film (I'm so uncultured...)!Suffice to say, regardless of the shortcomings and an absence of personal childhood nostalgia for the film, it still delivers strong entertainment today. Perfect casting, punctual dialogue and memorable scenes. It may not be the best 80s film I've seen, but it certainly has the gigawatts the maintain its lasting power for many years to come."
14.06.2019,10.0,"Just watched it after so many years. The movie is still great, oposit to most of the films from 80's. Zemekis did a very good job."
08.06.2019,10.0,A true classic with great storyline. Love everything about it and how it shows the impact of time traveling. Meaning the positive and negative impacts affects.
08.06.2019,10.0,"This movie has been a staple in many communities and united all walks of life. I can sit and enjoy this movie with my father as well as my little brother. It remains to be a movie with no date stamp meaning I can watch it years from now and it will still feel new! Its filled with comedy, adventures and family. I love this film."
27.05.2019,8.0,"Every film has flaws, this one included, but I'll be dam, this movie is 35 years old, and it still holds up incredibly well. I like the characters so much, and the way it's set up is almost flawless. See for yourself. It might just send you ""Back To The Future"". Pun Intended.(A-)"
27.05.2019,9.0,"""It's ironic that a movie about time is timeless""
Back to the Future comprises everything that is loved about the 80s and early 90s. It is obviously a movie that has become synonymous with pop culture and is widely regarded as one of the best science fiction works ever produced. Michael J. Fox and Christoper Lloyd's roles in this movie are phenomenal as well as the structuring of the plot and Alan Silvestri's brilliance in score makes this an enthralling ride that is unforgettable within its genre."
26.05.2019,10.0,A CLASSIC. every time I watch it it brings back memories. a good movie for any event and age.
25.05.2019,10.0,I absolutely LOVE this movie! Everything about this movie makes me so happy! It's one of my favorite time travel stories ever!
20.05.2019,10.0,"The best film ever made.I really cannot convey how much I love Back to the Future. I was born in 1976 so was the perfect age for when this was released at the Cinema. I spent my pocket money on ""Back to the Future everything"" sticker book, poster, pencil case for school, skateboard, you name it! I think I saw it about 5 times at my local Cinema, and then at least another 5 on VHS when it was released. I literally bugged the guy at the Video store not to sell it to anyone else when he was done with renting it out. I saved up and bought the ex-rental video from him when he got a new copy and watched it pretty much constantly!Everything about BttF is perfect. The story, the cast, the score, the locations, the De Lorean! BttF is a pure time-capsule (no pun intended) that whisks me back to being 9 years old again.Michael J Fox is wonderful as Marty in his break-out movie role, and I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role of Doc Brown with the perfection that Christopher Lloyd did. The rest of the cast are also extremely strong, everyone brings their game here to make the best film possible, and it shows.Both Bob's (Zemeckis and Gale) created absolute magic and captured it on film, there will literally never be another one like this. I know Bob Zemeckis was awarded the best director Oscar for Forrest Gump, but for me, Back to the Future will always be his crowning achievement. Alan Silvestri and Huey Lewis and the News added the cherry to the top of this wonderful cake with their fantastic score and music contributions! We also cannot forget Steven Spielberg, without him, Back to the Future may never have been made.If you are any kind of movie fan then BttF is a must. The fun and downright excellence of this film just shines through in every scene, it is infectious. You can tell that everyone had a great time making it!BttF also has the best cliff-hanger third act of any film I have ever seen! I still sit on the edge of my seat even now, and I must have seen it 50 times (Will Marty and Doc's plan succeed?).I showed it to my 7 year old son last weekend, and whilst he did not understand all of it, he loved watching it. There is a reason why Back to the Future became wildly popular, has stood the test of time, and is loved by different generations all around the world. The reason is because it takes the viewer through every emotion that a great film should, one moment you are basking in the cool of it all, the next you are laughing, the next you are on the edge of your seat. That, is visual storytelling at it's best!Extra bonus points must be awarded for making the Time Machine a DeLorean, this was an inspired and genius idea. The design of the Time Machine is second to none, it looks exactly like you would think a Time Machine should, and is, by my reckoning, the coolest car in cinema history. Pulling a car with such a troubled history from relative obscurity, and turning it into one of the most recognizable in the world was a master-stroke.I think being there in 1985 the first time around gives me a particularly special relationship with Back to the Future, but everyone should see it at least once, as I said, I think it is the best film ever made, and the collective work is the best trilogy ever made!Thank you to everyone who came together to make the Back to the Future trilogy happen. You gave us something really incredible, unique, and timeless!"
18.05.2019,8.0,And we all have to the game for you to come to my life and i i the night is the day wywi is a time of night for me to the game and i the game i the night i i the season we will the winners
23.04.2019,9.0,"I saw this movie in my ""Classic Movies"" week. I haven't seen a lot of ""classics"" or old movies. I have seen Jaws, E.T and Clueless. I really didn't care about them. They were ""okay"" but nothing more.
But this movie is something else! The story is great! A lot of things happens, but not to many. I don't think, that anything is rushed over, which is one of the biggest fails in movies! It's a incredible idea! Where jaws is a great white shark, and that's basically it, this got so much more!
But the thing that amazed my the most was the acting! I really love the acting! From everyone! It's really insane how good these actors are!
And can we talk about that ending?!
So all in all, a MUST see movie!"
14.04.2019,9.0,"Back to the future is a funny and action packet movie which is a perfect family sit down. A 17 year old teenager called Marty Mcfly goes back in time to 1955 and has to find away to get back to his year 1987. The movie is great for all ages since its a action comedy has no swearing,and no physical violence.I don't recommend it for kids that are under 6 years old cause they might get a bit confused, but what is great is that for some older people they might connect with a few things that happens to Marty in 1955 that will seem weird to the new generation which is all normal back then, but anyway the movie still is great it has great acting and voice play with the main characters being Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd who is also in Star Treck. The director Robert Zemeckis has done a great job in explaining the characters so you can build a bond between you and them. I really recommend this movie."
12.04.2019,10.0,"This movie is virtually perfect in every way. This is by far the best trilogy out there: the music was amazing; Spielberg's directing was magical; Christopher Lloyd (Doc), Thomas Wilson (Biff), and Michael Fox (Marty) were simply perfect; while the plot had me completely immersed in its adventure. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest moving from the rock you're living under and get yourself hooked in all 3 of these masterpieces. ""Give me a milk - chocolate!"""
07.04.2019,10.0,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Micheal J. Fox was a perfect Marty McFly
03.04.2019,10.0,"The adventures of the McFlies and the Tannens, as well as Professor Brown, between the XIXth and XXth centuries, are part of the great movie classics of the 1980s.Flagship work, ""Back to the Future"" is above all a beautifully written story, by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, which is then masterfully staged with an anthology cast who embodies their role to perfection from the main roles to the extras. It seems like every actor was born to play their part, which is a hallmark of the fabulous 1980s, in order to bring to life an inventive story that travels between 1985 and 1955 with insight, humor and liveliness.In this first episode, we discover Marty and his family, Jennifer Parker, Biff Tannen, Emmet Brown and Einstein. The 1950s are reconstructed with great care, and the links with the 1980s are tied with a subtlety and a tenderness that reinforce our nostalgia, when we watch the film again 35 years later, with an even greater time lag than that which separates Marty's teenage years in the 1980s from the adolescence of his parents in the 1950s.The magic operates over the decades, both with those nostalgic for this era and with the new generations who discover this saga with delight."
27.03.2019,10.0,"The 1985 movie ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a timeless - pardon the pun - classic. It truly is a movie that has withstood with the trials of time and proves to be a movie that you can watch again and again and it actually never loses its appeal or charm.Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale managed to put together a very original story here, one that captivates the audience from the very beginning and keeps a grip on the audience until the very end. The story told in ""Back to the Future"" is a story that has so many aspects and so many topics that there definitely is something that appeal to everyone in the audience; ranging from romance, action to science fiction.There is a great pacing to the movie, and director Robert Zemeckis ensured that the movie never left momentum or dropped down in its pacing. This definitely made the movie all the more enjoyable and certainly ensured that the movie can be watched again and again.The movie is packed with great actors and actresses. Of course the movie is so phenomenally well carried by Michael J. Fox in the lead role as Marty McFly, and he definitely made that character lovable and memorable. But right up alongside Fox was Christopher Lloyd in the memorable role as the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown. Who can't claim to be familiar with the expression ""Great Scott!""? Furthermore, the movie also brought along Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, whom individually also brought a lot of contents to the movie with their appearances and performances.I can't count the number of times that I have watched this movie, nor the other two in the franchise for that matter. But the original 1985 ""Back to the Future"" is a classic in every meaning of the word.While the movie is from 1985, then the special effects still holds solid even in 2019. Sure they wear symptoms of aging, certainly, but still the special effects are quite good. And back in 1985, they were off the charts.If you, for some unknown reason, never have gotten acquainted with ""Back to the Future"", then shame on you. This is a movie that you HAVE to watch. ""Back to the Future"" is one of those movies that you need to watch regardless of your age, creed and standing."
25.03.2019,10.0,"I grew up watching this movie and even after 25 years of watching it I am not getting bored. I love the characters, the soundtrack, the fun and good told story and last but not least the time machine itself.
The whole movie (also the 2 sequels) feels like an adventure you want to watch it over and over again. Full of Easter eggs and clever jokes makes it the best adventure-comedy of all time."
19.03.2019,10.0,"What a movie! Top 5 80's
Actors/plot incredible
And I love you Lorraine"
27.02.2019,10.0,Back to the future is the best movie from the 90's. I wasn't born yet when it was first released but I would watch it later at 13 and loved the movie ever since.
26.02.2019,10.0,"All time classic, one of the greatest movies ever. Everything you want in a movie. It's the year 2019 but it seems like yesterday. Hope to see another adventure with respect yo the trilogy"
24.02.2019,10.0,Maybe i saw the whole triolg 100 times !!!!! One of the best triolgys ever
14.02.2019,8.0,"This movie is really entertaining and they show differences in time periods really well. The relationships between Micheal J Fox and his parents are really funny and interesting, it makes you think what would you do if you were in high school with your parents."
13.02.2019,9.0,I have watched this movie many times and will continue to watch it many more times. this is my favorite time travel comedy movie and will continue to be. this movie did a really great job portraying the 80s from its language to its sets. the other Back to the Futures where also as good as this one. there was nothing not to like about the movie it was so great overall. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that has or hasn't seen it.
08.02.2019,9.0,"This is one of my favorite movies, as it is hits all of my interests. Like engineering, time travel/ conspiracies, action, and humor.
The plot of the story is great. I love how Marty goes back to his parents prime time in high school. The plot can also explain how one little effect can create a bigger problem.
History in the movie i feel like it is correct. The team to make this movie did a really good job of making one feel like they are in those two time periods that take place. The style of talk and dress looks to be accurate to that time period. Spielberg is a great director, other movies that I enjoyed watching from him include monster house, polar express, and my second favorite from him real steel. Micheal j Fox did a really good job playing the role of Marty Micfly. I don't beilive I have seen other movies from him.
My favorite part of the whole movie was the story. Time travel is so interesting to me. I also love the character of doc brown. As he is very optimistic and smart."
06.02.2019,7.0,This is a great movie. Back to the Future part II is better. But still this a great movie. With great acting. It also has great story line. I hope you don't think that is spam it might ruin your wonderful community.
06.02.2019,8.0,"The director of ""Back to the Future"" is Robert Zemecks, main characters are Marty McFly( Michael J. Fox), Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd),Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson), George McFly(Crispin Glover). The history part of this movie that interest me is that it shows the differences between the two time periods, such in clothing, cars, places, buildings. My favorite part was when Martys' mom found him attractive. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, I would definitely watch it again ."
06.02.2019,10.0,"This movie is a classic and one of my favorites. I used to watch it when I was little and it has always been a family favorite. It has a fun story line and a very interesting concept. It has many great scenes. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Marty, the main character, realizes that he is in 1955 instead of 1985 and he meets his dad and Biff.
This movie is about Marty, a high school student, and his friend, Dr. Brown, a scientist, who creates a time machine in the form of a car. Marty gets transported from 1985 to the past in 1955. He meets his parents who are then in high school and he has to get his mom to fall in love with his dad so that he will still exist in the future.
The history in this movie is interesting because it kind of compares the 50's era with the 80's era. I knew about both eras before; mostly what the styles in clothing were. I really like the way they compared the two eras using the contrast between Marty who was from the 80's and his parents who were from the 50's and how they interacted with each other. It made me wonder what it would be like if I went to the past and met my parents.
The director of this movie is Robert Zemeckis. I have seen a couple of the movies he has made and thought that they were well made. The main actors are Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, and Crispin Glover. I haven't seen any other movies that I know of with these actors in it, but I am familiar with the actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. I enjoyed all of these actors in this show and thought they did a great acting job. My favorite scene from this movie was when Marty gets hit by his grandpa's car and meets his mom for the first time as a teenager. It was a well done scene because it set up the problem that Marty had to fix.
I just overall love this movie. It brings back great memories from when I was young. It is fun to follow and it has a different plot that really makes you think about what it would be like if something similar happened to you. I would recommend this to people who like science fiction and who just want a good laugh and fun movie to watch."
05.02.2019,7.0,It's no surprise that this film is praised by so many people. This movie is very exciting and fast paced. It doesn't take long before Marty finds him self traveling from 1985 back to the 1950. Marty's adventure to get back to his time is entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The film is also very humorous. Throughout the whole film it never really seems to drag except for one point in the middle.
04.02.2019,9.0,This movie was released before I was born and was a classic my parents watched when they were teenagers. All this time later and they still hold up. The movie is fun. I really like the conflict with the past and present in this movie because it is just so fun to watch. I think they did a really good job portraying the two different generations. I think this movie will forever be a classic
04.02.2019,8.0,"Once you've seen a show since childhood almost 10 times it's easy to say that it's flawless, however as I watched this movie for a History Through Film class, I wanted to watch it as objectively as I could without my biases.
This film contains very dynamic characters (Marty and Doc) along with a few static ones (Biff). Spielberg's writing hits its mark once again by making a story with wonder but one that we can all connect with on personal levels. This movie it very fitting of being label as a classic that everyone sees.
While this movie is great, there is a few flaws. There is that classic 1980s super close up face shots that I cannot stand. Another problem with the movie is again an issue I have with a lot of 80s era movies, which is bad sound design. The super loud sound effects with a lot of the movie consisting of yelling."
04.02.2019,10.0,This was a really good movie. I loved how you separated the two different time periods. The differences you put in there like their clothes and inventions that were created. I loved the excitement in the film with what he is going to do with his mom in high school and how he supposed to get his mom and dad together again. I also love how things changed with the littlest changes in the past. This was an exciting film all together.
04.02.2019,10.0,I can see how this movie is a classic. This film is very entertaining. The story line was very original when it first came out which makes the film even better. Its interesting to see how they dressed in the 80s and the 50s. The music they had back then was good. I feel like there are still some people who dress like the people in the movies. Micheal J Fox did a great job of playing Marty Mcfly. I love the way the movie ended. It was a great way to set up the sequel.
01.02.2019,10.0,A great movie with a nice story that everyone will enjoy!
31.01.2019,7.0,"I know I've seen this movie before but I couldn't remember when or what happened. I kept getting it confused with Flight of the Navigator, a very similar movie in which a 12 year old boy disappears for eight years and suddenly comes back having not aged at all. Set in very similar time periods, it was easy to get them confused. Both are about time travel. One goes to the past and almost messes up history. One goes to the future after being gone for an extended period of time. Neither character look like they've aged. Marty is only in the past for a week, so you can't really age that much anyway.
When Marty McFly travels back in time to 1955 and spends that week with inventor Dr Emmett Brown who he knew in 1985. When Marty saves his father's life and gets hit by his grandfather's car, he has to figure out a way to get his parents together so that he'll still exist in the future. His father, once a poor businessman who gets bullied by his boss, becomes a wealthy author whose childhood bully becomes an employee and has to wax his cars.
After reading some of the Goofs on this site, I learned that there were quite a few historical errors, mostly relating to when a particular thing was first introduced to society. Silly things like a Pepsi thermometer in the soda shop that wasn't introduced to society until a couple years later. Or the type on a poster that wasn't around that year. Or the vibrato thing on Marty's guitar when he's playing at the dance. I've seen Flight of the Navigator a movie that takes place in 1986, a little more than a year after this movie.
Christopher Lloyd as an actor is awesome. He's played many roles in many different movies and TV shows. He voices the Hacker in the children's series Cyberchase. He's the criminal guy in Dennis the Menace. He plays as Doctor Emmett Brown in all the Back to the Future movies. He's the professor in the second season of the BYUtv series Granite Flats. He voices Rasputin in Disney's version of Anastasia. Those are just the movies and tv shows I can think of off the top of my head. How many movies has this guy played in? He plays all of his roles beautifully and I would definitely watch other movies that he's in. He's a great actor. He seems to get a lot of roles for villains and crazy old people, but he plays them well."
30.01.2019,5.0,My favorite scene of the movie was when he came back to the future and his dad had a new car and was making his bully wax it. One personal experience to this movie is sometimes I talk such long naps that I end up feeling like I slept through a couple of years. The filmmaker is telling you that you should be glad you didn't go to school with your parents. They are also telling you that when your mom is hitting on you things can get a little weird. I knew in this part if history that women wore dresses. I also new they didn't have super nice cars. Something that is similar to this time in history is that people are still super clingy in relationships. I have not seen movies by this director. I think this was a good movie. I wouldn't mind seeing other movies by these people. I think the actors did a really good job. I liked the camera angles they were different from what you normally see. I don't think this is a movie I would watch outside of school. If I were to recommend this movie to someone it would be to my parents.
30.01.2019,10.0,"Back to the Future holds up, and probably will forever, The cast is perfect, Michael J Fox is a likable cool dude, Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is always enjoyable. This is a very enjoyable movie overall."
30.01.2019,8.0,"Really good story, funny and teaches you about the differences between the 80´s and 50´s. Great casting, the characters were portrayed perfectly. It´s a wonderful and exciting story where time shows us what our past was like."
30.01.2019,9.0,"I have never seen this movie, only have heard about it but I regret not seeing it earlier. It is a really good movie. In the movie Back to the Future, Marty travels 30 years back and has to fix a mistake he made involving his parents. I thought seeing the history of how 30 years could really change how store, cars, music and even what people wear was very interesting. All the styles of everything had changed. It makes me wonder how it would be 30 years from now would be and even how it was before. The director of this movie is Robert Zemeckis, I have never heard of him but I think he did a great job on this movie, especially since it was made in 1985. This is the first movie I also see with these actors, I would like to see more of there movies. Overall I thought this movie was great. I would recommend people to watch it even though I'm pretty sure almost everyone has seen it."
30.01.2019,9.0,"""Damn....damn!""
This movie takes place in the past, present, and future. A 17 year old boy gets sent 30 years to the past.
I think that it was really interesting the differences that there were in the different time periods. In the 50's segregation was still going on. African Americans were the waiters and didn't have any rights. In the 80's segregation was over and there was more acceptance. There was even a African American elected as mayor.
The director is Robert Zemeckis and some main characters are Lea Thompson, Micheal J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispín Glover. I haven't seen them in any other movies but I've heard about them.
I really liked the movies lines and plot. They had really funny sayings and the actors weren't that bad. I would watch this movie in my own home and recommend it to some friends even. Overall it was a good movie with very funny dialogue. And a interesting plot."
29.01.2019,10.0,"This film is thrilling, funny, emotional and unbelievably entertaining. The characters are brilliant, the plot involves time travel and feels more realistic than most films nowadays. The nostalgia, references and perfect plot will have you hooked within a few minutes of Marty, Dic and co."
22.01.2019,10.0,"One of the many reasons why this is my favourite movie of all times is because it's got one of the best scripts ever written for a movie. Everything that it's set up at the very beginning, pays off later.
For a movie that had such a rocky start from the production point of view and whose very creators didn't have much faith in, it sure made box office waves all around the world and made it one of the most fondly remembered and classical movies of the 80s. It catapulted Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd to stardom and turned one of the biggest automobile failures of the 80s into an iconic vehicle.
Everything seemed to fall into place for this one. Not only the screenplay, but the acting, directing, production design, visual effects, editing and cinematography. It's an extremely tightly edited movie, not a moment wasted, it moves along like lightning, and after all this years, its 80s look hasn't aged it one bit. This is one of the most entertaining cinematographic experiences ever and if you still haven't seen it; What are you waiting for?. Let's go back in time!!"""
12.01.2019,10.0,"Its a super movie
the rating iam giving is 10/10 super"
09.01.2019,10.0,"I have to admit, the way how this whole movie was made is pretty damn impressing to me. Like, can you think of someone who can make a masterpiece/classic about a teen boy traveling trought time with an actual DeLorean as a time machine? While, Robert Zemeckis definetly found a way!This movie is what i can call a absolute PERFECT combination. A combination of storytelling, writing, suspense, action, effects, acting and music. All of these things are just PERFECT in this film! That's why this movie truly is one of a kind. Something that Robert Zemeckis also did brilliantly with other movies of his in the 80's and 90's, like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" or ""Forrest Gump"".The movie just has this magic to it that ANYONE can enjoy, no matter who or how old you are. The main characters, Marthy and Doc Brown, are some of the most enjoyable and iconic characters in fiction to date, they are just a blast to watch! Including supporting characters, like Biff or Marthy's parents.The action scenes are also enjoyable and even more with the excellent special effects and music attached to it. And the story of the film is brilliant as well.Of course we've seen many time travel movies before, but the way how they did it in this one is incredible. This movie is truly a masterpiece and i can't have enough of it. I highly suggest to at least watch this movie ONCE in your lifetime, you won't regret it. And definetly show it to your kids (if you have any) they will love it!So this film is a fun, intelligent and action-packed sci-fi movie, that really raised the bar up when it comes to movie blockbusters and im giving this a
10/10 (i definetly won't change my rating in the future)"
09.01.2019,10.0,As a kid I loved this movie. The film has the best foreshadowing of any screenplay I've seen - and all the actors and production are timeless. There are dozens of classic lines. A magnificent score. And a wonderful moral story about a kid from a broken home how saves his family. The truth is - this franchise has eerie symbolism that links to our modern world.
03.01.2019,10.0,"Back To The Future is my favorite movie. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 years old back in elementary school days.
It is a movie about time traveling. Time traveling has always been exciting and fun. It's 1985 and Marty McFly is a typical teenager who doesn't like his parents and who has some problems at school. His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of useless machines. Their acting is awesome. I think this is not only because they are talented, but also because the director wrote a great screenplay, which showed how the acting should be in the film.
Also this movie has great ups and downs, which keep the audience's attention. Overall, I strongly recommend that you see this movie."
28.12.2018,10.0,"Back to the Future isn't only a great comedy and a thrilling sci-fi adventure, it's also one of the greatest movies ever made. Marty and Doc are timeless characters in an enduring story about standing up for yourself, taking charge of your destiny and matchmaking your parents. Plus, the years have only added another layer of nostalgia to this time-travel tale. Great Scott, Robert Zemeckis! You invented a classic!"
25.12.2018,10.0,"This film is utterly amazing everything about it is full of fun and excitement. I highly recommend this movie. The characters are so memorable with all there own quirks. The characters are so well rounded and make me laugh every time. The acting is pretty good, nothing special but fine. The special effects still hold up today despite the fact the film was released over 30 years ago. If you love 80's movies you will adore this film it has the 80's cheese and it has a lot of heart. The score in this film is incredible. The music uplifts you to places you cant imagine its so memorable. Alan Silvestri (the composer) makes music that manages to meld with the emotions of the characters in very effective way. I love this film so much it deserves a lot of praise. Watch This movie!"
22.12.2018,10.0,"I originally saw Back to the Future on TV when I was young. Several years later, my brother bought the 30th Anniversary Trilogy box set. What a trip down Memory Lane!Back to the Future is a brilliant movie. Teenager Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) accidentally travels back in time in a car his friend Doc Brown had invented - shortly after Brown is murdered by Libyan terrorists. He meets the younger Doc and convinces him that he is a genuine time traveler. But while they figure out a way to send Marty back to the future, they realise that Marty accidentally interfered with his parents' first meeting - endangering his own existence. They must not only work on returning Marty back to 1985 (he went back to 1955), but they must get Marty's parents to fall in love.The movie's brilliantly scripted. It's very funny. The acting is good. And the effects (when used) are quite good. To quote one critic's praise, ""It wastes very little in the way of dialogue"". EVERYTHING that's said is put in there on purpose. Pay close attention throughout the film. It's hugely fun to watch. A true masterpiece."
20.12.2018,8.0,"Back To The Future is an 80's classic. Michael J. Fox is at his finest and Christopher Lloyd's character adds a lot of crazy and witty humor to the film. If you want to catch up on 80's nostalgia, this is the one! It's also a good clean film that families can watch together."
15.12.2018,9.0,"Quite simply, this is one of the best film ever made"
13.12.2018,10.0,This is one of the most fun and stylish movies ever.
07.12.2018,10.0,This was one of the first movies that made me love to watch movies...absolutely Brilliant cast
05.12.2018,10.0,"Is the pure essence of 80s blockbuster. Must-watch sci-fi comedy, a cult for a generation of kids, a movie to laugh and to enjoy with friends. Actors are top class. You'll love it."
05.12.2018,10.0,"I saw this movie in theaters as a young lad an movie magic it was! the concepts of time and space and fourth dimensional thinking set me on the start of an educational career that has had me dining with Nobel Laureates asking me for advice on their technical experiments! This movie with it's do it your self, hang in there man til it's right message resonated with me and allowed me to soar above and beyond local expectations. This is what good aspirational movie magic is all about for our society to get the next generation to dream bigger than we could have imagined! We need more movies like this one!"
27.11.2018,9.0,"An endearing mad scientist cracks the secret to time travel and snares his young assistant in a complicated familial paradox. Do I really need to summarize? The original Back to the Future is one of the decade's most ambitious, identifiable smash hits, a genre-straddling film that's still effective more than thirty years later.With a warm, slightly off-kilter personality, fabulous characters, a craftily complex plot and a fantastic musical score, there's no shortage of reasons why it's aged so well. Perhaps most impressive is the cast; one perfect fit after another. Michael J. Fox, at the onset of his overnight fame, is equal parts driven and perplexed by the chaos surrounding his life. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover each nail double roles as deflated, defeated adults and their glowing, energetic teenage counterparts. Christopher Lloyd might be the best of them all as Doc Brown, the forever-old, slightly deranged mastermind who never completely believes he's accomplished his life's greatest goal.The story has a few holes (what time-skipping adventure doesn't) and sometimes tries to be a little too cute, but such shortcomings are easily brushed aside as the large/small adventures unfold. Expertly written, directed, acted and produced, with memorable lines a'plenty and a charming, optimistic spirit, it's a well-worn favorite."
26.11.2018,10.0,"Ce film est très bien, on rentre dedans très vite et on a toujours envie de la revoir !"
21.11.2018,10.0,I wwould give it 100 stars if i could. Such a good mobie. Muvh better than Dirty Harry
19.11.2018,10.0,"One of my favourite movies, which i can watch every day! Everyone should have watched this masterpiece once a lifetime. The story is cute and funny, but also super thrilling."
19.11.2018,10.0,"I could watch BTTF all the time, it's just perfect! The definition of a cult movie!
It has everything! I always come back to this movie i think i've watched it more than 50 times! That's heavy! 10/10"
19.11.2018,9.0,"Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wrote a screenplay back in the 80s that was having troubles getting made. Due to earlier projects such as I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND, 1941 and USED CARS all did not light up the box office. Once Zemeckis made ROMANCING THE STONE people in Hollywood were looking more at this writing duo and their projects. Thank God, because this was one of the best trilogies ever made!Within the first 10 minutes or so of this film we see Marty McFly (excellently played by Michael J. Fox) back in 1985. He has a super-dorky dad (Cripsin Glover), drunk mom (Lea Thompson) and two older siblings (Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber) who are no longer at high school, but still live at home. Not to mention his band The Pinheads were silenced at an audition for being just too darn loud. At my prom it would have been amazing to have them rock the night away. After we see the first 10-15 minutes of the film it really does start to pick up and we are introduced to his friend Doc Brown (wickedly played by Christopher Lloyd and could be his best part in his career). He has just invented a new time machine. To make a long story short McFly ends up in the time machine and travels back to 1955 when his parents were in high school. So, he has to meet the younger Doc Brown and have him send him back to the future. At the same time not trying to meet his parents or screw up their relationship in any way.This really is a terrific sci-fi/comedy from 1985 that lets your imagination soar, laughter fly and emotions ride. Spawned two sequels that were also great. Also has quite an amazing score by Alan Silvestri that is in fact one of my favourites. Also has some great original tunes by Huey Lewis & the News.Also starring Thomas F. Wilson who is amazing as the bully Biff and his three thug friends J.J. Cohen, Casey Siemaszko and Billy Zane. Totally a need-to-see for anyone who likes a little bit of sci-fi, because even though it is really based on time travel the sci-fi elements are not overwhelming. I have watched this and its sequels endless times over the years since I first seen it over 30 years ago. Highly recommended."
16.11.2018,10.0,"In a summer when Rambo 2 made everyone look into vietnam again and Live Aid dominated TV screens, this film comes out of nowhere to become the highest grossing film of Robert Zemeckis' career until Cast Away came out 15 years later. This film spawned two sequels, a short lived animated series, numerous video games, and a theme park ride. This movie changed the face of time travel movies."
09.11.2018,10.0,"Without a doubt, the best film of the 80's, full of good comedy, good actors, good soundtrack, good story, good sound mix, good special effects. This movie has EVERYTHING a movie needs to have to be considered a movie classic that everyone should watch at least 10 times in their lives. One of the best movies ever, I RECOMMEND VERY MUCH."
31.10.2018,,"It's a classic masterpiece, my favorite time travel science-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and it was ahead of its time. I grew up with this movie !"
27.10.2018,9.0,"My Rating : 9/10The crown jewel of the trilogy, the first Back to the Future has everything you could want from a comedy: Christopher Lloyd, a time machine made from a DeLorean, Libyans, a radical guitar solo, and incest. What's not to love? The follow up films don't compare to the first, as is the case with most sequels, but once you watch this one you have an urge to watch them all."
25.10.2018,7.0,"When I first saw Back to the Future I was only 10/11 years old and I thought it was inspirational to think that a future like that was achievable in my lifetime. As a young kid it made me ""think big"" and that anything was possible.
I also loved the soundtrack especially Huey Lewis, those songs always remind mr of the film & being that age."
18.10.2018,10.0,Back to the Future is a fantastic movie with a great story and great characters. It has charm and it's a blast to watch over and over again. One of the best movies of the era.
17.10.2018,7.0,"As time goes! 
For good or bad, time puts things in their place. The current blockbuster happens to be an empty entertainment without much interest in delving into the issues that sometimes proposes. Back to the future is an example of this evolution to the current blockbuster. The themes of the film are developing roughly and put on the table interesting points but stays on the surface. The simplistic universe that proposes a priori annoying to take the movie as a serious thing but plays a lot in their favor to take it as a simple metacomedia of the time in retrospect.
BUT there are also good things, the script of the film is a masterpiece that nowadays is studied because it is so round. Its importance lies in giving coherence to science fiction that until then was left in second place.
The characters despite not being super complex are charismatic and work wonders even if they are medium interpretations.
The audiovisual narrative is quite functional and surprises me for good.
The fast paced also helps to never disconnect and invest in the plot of the film."
16.10.2018,10.0,"SO AMAZI, Dale and I watched this 3x in a row. My fave of all time. Greatest story ever and super cast. Michael j fox is the Best!."

26.09.2018,9.0,"When I first watched this film I thought ""yeah what a good film"" Now it simply blows me away, a true classic with quality acting and superb story development. What a gem..."
19.09.2018,8.0,Great film that I still have pleasure to watch although I must have seen it dozens of times.
18.09.2018,7.0,A film that makes time travel comprehensive and very enjoyable
13.09.2018,10.0,"This movie has INFLUENCE at my imaginary world, since from childhood. God Damn it, I watched several times and NEVER get bored."
07.09.2018,10.0,"Wow, and again wow.. I grew up watching this film series, and even now there is nothing that compares.. even Robert Zemeckis and Speilberg know they couldn't pull this off again.. absolute timeless classic.. the perfect trilogy in my opinion"
04.09.2018,9.0,"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for a ransom, I can tell you, I don't have money. But what I do have, are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long (but not really that long) career. Skills that make me a nightmare for the people like you. If you admit that it is absolutely splendid now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if it is true, that you despise the movie Back to the Future, I'll look for you, I'll find you and I'll educate you on the most likable movie ever conceived... (Verdict: A+)"
03.09.2018,10.0,"The first Back to the Future movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. It is a classic movie, and is widely considered one of the best movies Universal Studios has ever produced, even over 30 years later. Back to the Future was the first major success of Robert Zemeckis' directing career, who would later go on to direct easily recognizable movies such as Forrest Gump, A Christmas Carol, and The Polar Express among others. Michael J. Fox plays the protagonist of the movie, Marty McFly, which is one of the coolest names I have ever heard. According to empireonline.com, Marty McFly is the 12th greatest movie character of all time, higher than Iron Man, Captain Jack Sparrow, and Gandalf. Doc Brown finds himself 20th on that same list. This movie is set in the year 1985, and takes place in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California. Marty is a 17 year old teenage boy who finds himself in a situation like any other.Marty unknowingly changes the course of his life, and history, when he accidentally takes a modified Delorean car back in time using Plutonium stolen by Libyan Terrorists. These terrorists hoped to make a nuclear weapon using this plutonium, and seeked the help of Dr. Emmett Brown. Instead of making this weapon, Dr. Brown uses the plutonium to modify a Delorean spots car and turn in into a fully functional time machine.There are many reasons why people should watch this movie, widely known as one of the best movies of the 1980s. The concept of time travel was a popular one, as Arnold Schwarzennegger's The Terminator having come out the year before. For Back to the Future to come out the next year, adding fuel to the time travel fire that The Terminator created. Some would argue that the Back to the Future trilogy is one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time, maybe even eclipsing those of The Godfather and Lord of the Rings. My personal favorite in the Back to the Future trilogy is the first one due to the plot twists it takes. The first time I had watched this movie, I really didn't know what to expect, but I was quickly fascinated by the intricacy of the plot. The plot is brilliantly interwoven in movie, with setups buried throughout the entire film. One of my favorite things about Back to the Future's plot is how the movie is centered on the idea of running out of time. A ticking clock is central symbol, counting down to the moment when Marty will be stranded forever in 1955, or even to the moment when Marty will actually cease to exist because he's interfered with his parents getting the chance to fall in love. I really enjoyed Back to the Future, and went on to enjoy the remaining two movies in the trilogy. Although millions have enjoyed this movie and place it high up on their ""All-Time"" lists, not everyone has a favorable opinion of this movie, as hard to believe as it may seem.On the IMDB website regarding Back to the Future, it was hard to find negative reviews. Considering that Back to the Future is considered one of the greatest films ever made, that finding did not come as a surprise. One of the negative comments was that the movie did not portray the idea of time travel in a serious manner. How can one possibly expect talk about the idea of time travel to be serious in a film made with the sole purpose to entertain? Back to the Future was definitely not meant to revolutionize the science of traveling through time, and should not be criticized as such. I feel that Back to the Future is unfairly criticized for its lack of ""serious talk about time travel."" Say Stephen Hawking were involved in the production of this movie. Surely the newfound seriousness would overshadow the comedy that this movie intended to be. The humor of the movie would be lost, leaving viewers confused if they are watching a childish documentary about time travel, or if they are watching a comedy that was unsure of its own identity, jumping back and forth between humor and science."
24.08.2018,10.0,"A childhood classic which clamps you to your sofa. I have seen it more than 20 times, but always shows something new. :-)"
23.08.2018,,"The story of the film is groundbreaking, with tons of follow-up films imitating this one, particularly X-men: Days of the Future Past. The storytelling is solid and down-to-earth, and Fox and Lloyd both give stunning performances. The film also succeeds technically. The music score is inspiring, the visual effects are compelling, and the sound effects are perfect."
09.08.2018,8.0,Good movie. Great for the family. This film never gets old
06.08.2018,10.0,"Wow! Just WOW!!! I fell in love with the movie from the first scene. Even though some actors left in the sequel, it doesn't mean, this one was the best! Michael J Fox is amazing. Christopher Lloyd, just wow! Him as doc brown amazing choice! Here's something interesting, this movie takes place on October 21st 1985/1955. Christopher Lloyd's birthday is October 22nd. I thought this movie was one of the best!!!!! A must watch!"
05.08.2018,10.0,"This is another of one of my favorite films of all time. This film is special to me in so many ways, from the fact that it's another film from my childhood I saw this when I was about seven years old. But most importantly this was the very first time travel sci-fi I've ever seen and it's still my favorite in the sci-fi subgenera. Back then I never even heard of the genre and the concept, this film is one hell of an introductory, it was a concept that blew me away the ability to travel anywhere throughout time; personally, for me I'd love to revisit the 80's decade which is funny to say since this film was made in the 80's. You could also say this was the film that steered me to my favorite TV show of all time ""Doctor Who"".This film just has so much, I really like the story which is fun and clever at the same time. One thing this film does well is the fact things aren't overcomplicated, the fundamental problem with most time travel stories are sometimes they have this stupid need to complicate things or play around too much which really swiss cheeses the story in plot and consistence or that it's overly concerned on the concept and logic but little on story. This film keeps things simple because it keeps the car on the road, by keeping the focus on character and story. Sure, there is a slight complication and inconsistency in this story but it's not noticeable not even concerned about it, even I wasn't and let's face it all time travels stories have this. The film also kind of stays true to the pulp sci-fi as their concern was for story and adventure and logic was shelved.The characters are great from Biff Tannen played well by underrated actor Thomas F Wilson whom is one of my favorite fictional villians as throughout the film series he's had several versions of himself about as many as any Time Lord from ""Doctor Who"". He's a villain you love to hate, yeah, he's basically a bully whom I normally despise but here it's handled right where he's a person you easily can despise but have fun with at the same time. He has some of the best lines, but I think what really makes him stand out is the fact that he's an idiot. Despite the guy being big and strong, having the best car, it's all really just a way to pass himself as cool, the guy literally thinks he's really cool even though in reality everyone around him knows he a dirtbag.But of course, the two characters that really make the film are Marty and Doc Emit Brown played by two of my favorite actors Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd. These two are defiantly one of my favorite duos, both play off each other and balance each other out well.Marty McFly is great he's one of my favorite fictional protagonists because he's someone I can easily emphasize with as I was a kid from the 80's and I can epaphisize with bits of his persona. As he's a teen from the 80's, as he's into skateboarding, music, camcorders, and a lot of things in the 80s, I'm a kid from the 80's I was into that stuff too. He's kind of on the rebellious side, but he's more of a silent rebel as he doesn't always feel a total need to follow every rule, as he sometimes undermines the school principal, even I'm like that sometimes. But what I like about him is he's a person that has big dreams and ambitions, he wants his band to play in big events and also make music in the music world, however he has faced his series of rejections yeah, I can emphasize with that with my acting auditions; however he doesn't give up despite how much it hurts. Though also has dreams of love with his significant other Jennifer played well by Claudia Wells whom I thought was kind of hot, you really get a good feel for her and both of them as they've been a couple for a long time.I really like how Marty reacts to the 1950's decade, since he a kid from the 80's it's easy for me to emphasize with him since I was one to. To some people that either lived or close the decade of the 50's or historians that have some fascination with it, it would be a dream come true to be able to come back to it. But for a person like Marty and myself, we wouldn't really like it not to say it's a place I wouldn't mind visiting but not one I'd want to say in ; for one thing Marty traveled their unintentionally and with time travel machines you'd have the freedom to stroll out the door anytime you want but his freedom has been prohibited so that sucks. However, I really like in the first sequence of going to 1950's Hill Valley how disoriented and even scared he looks, I'm sure that would be how we would react to walking to a decade long gone it's like walking into another world. From seeing vintage cars, you would see in a car museum being driven conveniently, old songs you'd hear on an oldies but goodies on a sat radio station being played as if they've just made the billboard, certain things that aren't around yet like video games or further seasons of ""Doctor Who"", it wouldn't exactly be like going to a vacation spot.It's also funny in the film how Marty in an inadvertent way affects things not just from how he brings his parents together but also how may 'be he was one factor that may have helped get certain things in our modern-day culture started. Like the music he plays in the school dance, the skateboard, you name it. To me that's part of the what makes the film it funny and fascinating, it really shows how one person can really have a big affect on time without know it but also how one person truly can make a difference. Though it also brings up the parallel dynamic between both Marty and the 50's decade as both were a time of great changes from youth to culture.Doc Brown is just great as he's is a genius but is a bit childlike as he does have a bit of an eccentricity from his hairstyle which always seems to be stick up to even how rapidly inventive he is. However, he does have a good dose of common sense and wisdom which keeps him from not flying off the road but also able to interact properly and mentor Marty. But one thing about him I can easily emphasize with is on how fast he is, he the kind of person that loves to do lots of things and get things done but is aware he has limited time to do them. Like in one scene, he has built a rather elaborate scale model of the town but is apologetic that he didn't have enough time to paint and give it details, despite the fact it's looks great all the same. I just find that a little funny because I'm sort of like that myself where sometimes I get one thing done but there is one other thing I haven't got done yet or I wanted to do within the given time.I really love the DeLorean, it's my second favorite time traveling machine next to the Tardis on ""Doctor Who"" which you know is my first. Making a time traveling machine out of a car was unheard of at the time, personal I thought it was a cool idea and really is a lot more convient because with it you will not just travel back or forwards in time, but you'd be able to drive within that time period where ever you need to go and hide it better by driving to a spot. The effects on that DeLorean are cool just every time it travels in time it just leaves a vapor trail of fire on the road. Music is also great this film has probably one of the best soundtracks I know. From the theme song from Alvin Silvestri which perfectly reflects the movie as it has an adventurous tone. Another trademark are two other songs from the film ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back in Time"" by Huey Lewis and the News. As well as a few familiar oldies but goodies tracks, most notably the song ""Johnny Be Good"" at the dance.There are lots of fun moments I won't say them all since there are so many which makes the better because there's not one dull moment, from the big highlight for me is the Skateboard sequence which is one of my favorite chase scenes, here it's a skateboard skating away from an automobile. When you think about it being on a skateboard does have its advantages as Marty is able to ride on sidewalks and certain roadways and areas that an automobile would have a hard time accessing, which means plenty of opportunities to outmaneuver his opponent. But also, the fact that Marty is using a skateboard in the 1950's decade alone is really cool, since they didn't have skateboards back then. To even the small moments my favorite which is to me one of the best reference jokes ever when Marty puts himself in the Rad suit and is tricking George to asking Lorene out by mixing up two popular sci-fi franchises, that segment always cracks me up being a sci-fi fan.Well I've said enough, ""Back to the Future"" is a timeless classic that has the millage that goes beyond time.Rating: 4 stars"
27.07.2018,,"Back to the future is great and fun, there are a lot of interesting shots in this film, the main two actors are great but there are times where it's a little cheesy same with all the actors, the special effects are great and they have aged well, it's was interesting to have a main character who explore the past rather then a fictional world, overall go watch it you'll love it"
25.07.2018,10.0,"Christopher Lloyd and Michael j Fox as a duo, work so well together, the relationship between a nutty inventor and a teen from the 80s seems ridiculous on paper, but works so well on the screen. The soundtrack is unique, the direction feels like the work of Spielberg, and the dilemma that the film evolves around, stands out from all other films in its genre. I've loved this film since the first time watched it as a kid, and it just gets better the more I watch it."
19.07.2018,9.0,Enhances the mind. When watching this movie.Thanks to more good things in childhood life. Good movie.
14.07.2018,8.0,I didn't like it is because the acting was terrible and it makes no sense.
13.07.2018,10.0,"To be honest this movie is one of the best time travel movie I've seen in my entire life, I sure it will worth your previous time"
12.07.2018,10.0,"I've got an interesting relationship with this film, I was first introduced to it while channel flipping and stopped while the film was on. It made me laugh, cry, and jump with excitement. Ever since Zemekis has been one of my all time favorite filmmakers. Written by himself and Bob Gale, Back to the Future is a true testament to the passion project becoming a reality. Michael J. Fox delivers what is quite possibly one of his best performances ever, as well as Christopher Llyod. (who I believe deserved an Oscar nomination) The Script is highly original and inventive making the most of its time travel related story. The film also transcends the 80s teen comedy trope of bad films sitting up there with classics like Ferris Buellar and Breakfast Club unlike others. This is one of the best films ever made, and Inspires me to create art with just as much heart, humor, and passion."
05.07.2018,10.0,Perfect story and fantastic directed. And the story over the three films ties perfect together
28.06.2018,10.0,Only few people gets it truly. its awesome how they recreate same scene in different time
19.06.2018,7.0,Ótimo filme trás ótimos personagens e bom enredo ótimo para assistir em família

Fun for all the girls and boys.Grab some popcorn and soda and settle in for the ride of a lifetime"
02.06.2018,8.0,Great classic always pleasure when it pops up on television. I have been watching the show for years.
30.05.2018,10.0,"I will bestow my personally founded awards night to Robert Zemeckis for he has given all of us the opportunity of how it might feel if we happen to be friends with a genius inventor ( brilliant Christopher Lloyd) , his dog , and what might or might not happen if we go back in time and try to change the past. Didn't we all fantasize one way or the other of having a time machine ( even a Delorean at that ! ) Michael J. Fox is a fit shoe as Marty and the whole cast blends in like a smoothie in a blender . I beg those souls especially the younger ones to watch this film and just enjoy. This is entertainment best defined no doubt."
28.05.2018,10.0,"Its a great movie, i love it so mutch. i wanna fall asleep holding this movie in my arms and also i wanna have sex with whoevers idea it was to make this movie. hand thy dick over, like its time for me to give it a big succ rn. so like stop reading this good ass review and call that person or something cause I'll do whatever it takes to satisfy and pleasure the person responsible for this masterpiece of a movie. did I even say that i like it? I guess not... its really good, i might even go as far as to say its my favourite movie, lol the shrek franchise sucks ass."
25.05.2018,10.0,"I know nobody who doesn't like this one! It's appeal is huge largely cause it's so genre-defying, it's a sci-fi, comedy, high school, action and by the third part even a western movie! The whole trilogy is great, although progressively gets weaker. Still even the last one is a blast and all three should be watched in order, since they make up one complete story. But the first one is the best for sure!"
21.05.2018,10.0,"One of the most important classics! Storytelling, effects, easter eggs, everything is there, including Spielberg's touch!"
21.05.2018,10.0,This is a classic for a reason and that is because it is one of the best sci-fi time travelling movies that has ever been created and is still loved in modern times.
19.05.2018,7.0,"It's pretty alright, almost as good as love on a leash"
13.05.2018,9.0,"Back to the futur is a film you simply never want to stop watching
I was greatly looking forward to this movie and it didn't disappoint me"
13.05.2018,10.0,"Best movie everrrr i cant believe someone did this so good omg i cannot decide which one of them is the very best, everything is so perfect i dunno what to say, imma so obsessed with this movie u have no idea guys. If u havent seen it yet, i dunno what u waitin for cuz kid u have no idea how good it is."
22.04.2018,8.0,"What appears to be quite fun and simple a film on the surface, is a much more complicated storyline, if you sit and work out the complexities of time travel surrounding the storyline.Many quotable lines, the best remembered film of Michael J Fox and a film that has followed me from childhood to adulthood."
18.04.2018,10.0,Back To The Future has stood the test of time - no pun intended. I've seen this film multiple times and absolutely love it. I can't see Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as anyone but Marty and Doc. It stretches the imagination of film and completely immersed you in a unique (at the time) story where you almost instantly connect with the character of Marty McFly. I really can't express how much I love this film. It is the epitome of creative story telling for me.
17.04.2018,10.0,"This movie was one of the first time-travel movies that I watched, But still for me this won't EVER get old! With its wonderful characters, So many amazing scenes from the hilarious ones to the action ones to the romance and so on... and overall the great story with all the sci-fi craziness. These stuff sure make it one of my all-time favorite movies.
I'd recommend this movie to those - if there were those - who haven't watched in the last 33 years."
15.04.2018,10.0,I have watched this again and again. My words can not do justice to this film a time travelling adventure that has everything and Michael J Fox is incredible as were the other actors
15.04.2018,10.0,"It has comedy, romance, adventure, drama, action, and suspense. Did I leave anything out? Oh yeah.......AN AWESOME SOUNDTRACK!!! And don't forget Back to the Future Part II and III."
05.04.2018,10.0,What can a millennial possibly say about this movie that has never been seen before by generations before him? One word comes to mind.... MASTERPIECE. This movie/trilogy may be the best screenplays to ever be produced. For anyone who has not watched this movie and thinks that movie will not hold up in 2018 is sadly mistaken. Give it a watch and you will be rating a 9+ star.
04.04.2018,10.0,"Back to the Future is my all time favorite film and it's been so since I first saw it back in 1985. The way that director Robert Zemeckis brings all the elements of the film together seems magical today as it did back then. The film does indeed have everything: drama, romance, comedy, sci-fi and it's all brought together in such an awesome way that seems to live on way past it's time. Whether it be the fantastic Delorean, the iconic characters, the memorable score or the skillful direction, there is hardly anything about Back to the Future that does not stand out."
30.03.2018,10.0,"I was flipping channels the other day and ran across BACK TO THE FUTURE, it was just about to start and since I hadn't seen it in quite awhile, I figured I'd catch the first part of it before venturing off to other surfing opportunities. As often happens in this sort of situation, I ended up transfixed by this film and watched the whole thing. After it was over, I asked myself why did I enjoy this film so much and my answer was fascinating (at least to me) -BACK TO THE FUTURE is about as perfect of a film as there is.Why? Let's start with the structure of this film. It follows the classic 3 Act structure. ACT 1: set up the premise, the gimmick (if any) and the stakes. ACT 2: escalate the stakes and throw in complications and obstacles. ACT 3: Resolve everything.Seems like a pretty simple formula, right? So why do so many get it wrong? Quite simply, they don't keep it simple and then execute (almost to perfection) the simplicity of the structure. Let's break down the 3 Acts of BACK TO THE FUTURE.ACT 1 - set up the premise, the gimmick and the stakes. The premise & gimmick is simple, time travel is possible and our hero travels back in time and is stranded there. The stakes are even simpler - our hero must find a way to get Back to the Future.ACT 2 - escalate the stakes and throw in complicaitons and obstacles. The stakes are escalated by the fact that our hero interrupts the timeline of when his mother met his father, thus there is the very real possibility that he will cease to exist for his parents never met. Our hero must find a way to bring his mother and father together. The complications are that his parents are not the boring old fuddy-duddy's that our hero thought they were, his father is a peeping-Tom nerd and his mother is a randy high-schooler who falls in love (lust?) with our hero, her son. Further complicating things is that the time machine must find enough power to make the time travel device (the flux-capacitor!) work, power that is not readily available in this timeline. Adding one more complication to the mix is the school bully who is constantly after our hero.ACT 3 - resolve everything. This is where this film excels. EVERY loose end is tied up. Our hero find a way to reunite his mother and father, the bully is put in his place, a source of energy is found and our hero's journey comes to a succesful conclusion.There is much, much more to this film than those plot points, but I just wanted to show how deceptively simple and efficient this plot is. Kudo's must go out to screenwriter's Robert Zemeckis (more on him later) and Bob Gale for coming up with this idea and executing it so well. Gale (1941, KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER) said he came up with this idea when he saw his father's high school yearbook and dreamed about going back to meet him. He stated that he doubted that he and his father would have been friends.An interesting side fact: The University of Southern California Film school's writing classes use the screenplay for Back to the Future as the model of ""The Perfect Screenplay"". So, I rest my case.But a ""perfect"" screenplay would be worthless without near perfect execution of putting the words and actions up on the screen - and this film achieves that as well. Director (and co-screenwriter) Robert Zemeckis (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, FORREST GUMP) cleary had a vision of how to make this film and did not waiver from it. The action is strong, the fluidness of the film is solid and the performances are all top-notch. The only thing that might knock this film down a peg or two is some of the 32 ""special effects"" shots that - to look at it these days - seem somewhat archaic (see the flames between Doc Brown's and Marty's feet when the DeLorean first goes forward in time). But for the time, these special effects are state-of-the-art.Speaking of performances, Michael J. Fox became a movie star with this film, and rightfully so. His Marty McFly is charming, quirky, intelligent, dorky - all at the same time. His uncomfortableness with his teen age mother is palatable. Credit must go with Director Zemeckis, who - after he couldn't get Fox released from his contract on the TV show FAMILY TIES - went (famously) with his 2nd choice, Eric Stoltz. When Stolt's seriousness and ""method"" acting was not meshing with the type of film he wanted to make, Zemeckis made the bold decision to fire Stoltz and worked out a deal where he can use Fox at night while Fox shot Family ties during the day. Playing against Fox, brilliantly, is Christopher Lloyd as ""Doc"" Emmit Brown. A two-time Emmy winner (at the time) for playing crazy Jim Ignatowski on the TV show TAXI, Lloyd played Doc Brown as ""part Einstein, part composer Leopold Stokowski"", creating what would be the benchmark for ""brilliant, scatter-brained scientist"". Leah Thompson does the finest performance of her career as Marty's mother and Crispin Glover was beyond quirky as Marty's nerd/loser Dad. Finally Thomas F. Wilson is the embodiment of bully as ""Biff"" Tannen.After the success of this film, two other BACK TO THE FUTURE films were made - films that I feel were good, but somewhat diluted the perfection of this film. No matter. Sit down, relax and enjoy one of the most ""perfect"" films ever made.Letter Grade: A+A rare 10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

20.03.2018,10.0,BTF is the most creative movie ever. It strongly deserves to be on the top of the list. This gripping mixed sci-fi comedy movie enshrined in it's cast and scenario.
15.03.2018,10.0,One of the best classics. This movie never gets old. Genius.
28.02.2018,10.0,"Sci-fi aficionado? Look no further! This movie is ""heavy"" stuff! :)"
13.02.2018,9.0,"This is overall a very funny and entertaining classic that can be enjoyed by most everyone. There are many plot conveniences, but luckily none of them are a result of characters being stupid. Though not all of the characters are intelligent, they're not too dumb to breathe. The characters that are dumb aren't unrealistically so. All the actors' performances are very good. Most of the jokes are pretty clever, and there are a lot of consistencies within the movie's world that other movies wouldn't have. This movie is kind to people who like to use their brains. Even though the effects are old, they're still pretty good and unlike the music I wouldn't describe them as cheesy. The plot is entertaining and easy to follow."
13.02.2018,10.0,"For over 3 decades millions of people enjoyed this incredible trilogy. The film is about Time travel and it's truly TIMELESS, for very simple reason: people loved it back in 80s, they love it today and will love it for many generations to come!!!"
04.02.2018,10.0,This is such a great movie !! I love it sooo much:)
22.01.2018,10.0,"At first, I want to say that I LOVE the BTTF trilogy. It has humour, action, romance and ofcourse science fiction. And Back to the Future itself is my favorite movie ever. But is actually also the best movie ever. It has everything. Especially the chemistry between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant. 10/10"
15.01.2018,10.0,Back to the future is one of the stories that you never forget! Its so amazing... There is bad comment only good things to say. The cast is awesome! The story! Its doesnt age! Its one of the sequel that I will always have in mind even in 50 years from now!
14.01.2018,8.0,"Back to the Future is a movie about Marty McFly and his crazy scientist friend Dr Emmet Brown and they go on a crazy time traveling adventure as they travel to the past and mess with the outcome of the future and have to rush to fix it before they alter time. Michael J. Fox is Marty McFly your average teenage boy who gets thrust into an adventure which would open his eyes to the past. Christopher Lloyd is the crazy scientist Emmet Brown who uses a delorean as the shell of a time machine. there are supporting actors like Lea 
Thompson,Crispin Glover they are the main supporting cast so overall its a solid cast of great actors who master there roles. I love back to the future it is one of my favorite movies of all time and it has earned that because i think it's popularity it became a instant classic and it's so re watchable that any one can watch it and for that it's earned that position."
05.01.2018,9.0,This movie has a special place in my life. I've watched it with many different pairs of people and no matter what it's always a great time. An all time favorite for me. Back to the Future II tops it with their flash backs to the first film. Such an amazing story that inspired me to become a filmmaker!

26.12.2017,10.0,"There are some films that are just timeless and everyone should watch (especially in today's climate of remakes, reboots and reimaginings). Basically, see it before it gets horribly remade with overblown computer effects and wafer-thin characters that you simply just don't care about. By now, you can probably already tell that I love this film and I'm effectively going to 'gush' about it, so if you just want to accept now that it's a definite 10/10 you might as well stop reading now. However, if you're vaguely interested as to why I think it's so - technically - perfect, then feel free to read on. In case you're one of the few people that have been living in 1955 all your life and have only just arrived in our year courtesy of a time machine, you may need to know that 'Back to the Future' is about time travelling. Marty McFly, played by the ever youthful Michael J Fox, gets caught up in eccentric inventor, Doc Brown's, latest scheme to build a time machine out of a DeLorean car. Naturally, things don't go smoothly as he inadvertently ends up in 1955 and accidentally interferes with the very moment his parents got together, therefore possibly preventing him from every being conceived. If this wasn't bad enough, he's only got a one-shot chance at returning to his own time thanks to a lightning bolt due to power his time machine for the return trip.I think what makes this film stand the tests of time is the fact that it is a true 'family' film. Whereas most films which can be watched by children are largely aimed ONLY at them and force the adults to sit through it until it's over, I can't imagine anyone - male/female, young/old - not actually finding enjoyment out of this adventure. It's funny without ever being childish or vulgar, exciting without ever being over the top or unrealistic (if you're willing to suspend your disbelief enough to believe that time travel is actually possible) and, of course, it contains some of the most memorable characters ever committed to film. Naturally, our dashing young hero, Marty, is very easy to root for, however it's his cranky old sidekick 'Doc', played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd who steals every scene and is the true joy to watch all the way through. It's also worth mentioning that Marty's on-screen family also can hold their own, played different versions of themselves throughout the time periods, but special mention should go a character who should - by rights - be little more than a stereotypical bully, yet 'Biff' somehow becomes the clichéd bully that all other on-screen thugs aspire to be ever after. If this film has a downside - and I'm only mentioning this because I can see that some people may have a problem with it these days (I didn't and still don't!) it's that there are a few topics of humour that some people may find a little 'edgy' in today's PC culture. For some reason I get the feeling that today any 'family' movie may shy away from a mother inadvertently falling in love with her son, but it was the eighties and things were different then!There aren't many movies that still can bring a family together around the TV in the living room on Christmas Day, but this is still one of them. If you haven't already brought the entire trilogy on DVD, then watch it now and show your children. It deserves to entertain future generations. Yes, the following two 'Back to the Future' movies weren't quite so well-received by the critics, but I think they're great, too."
20.12.2017,10.0,There are a few movies that are so perfect that I hope they never remade. This is one of them...One of the greatest movies ever in my opinion. It's so well thought out and put together. A true cult classic and masterpiece.
13.12.2017,10.0,This is one of those movies you just can't hate. It's just a classic from the 80s that just amazing no matter how many times you watch it. 10/10
03.12.2017,10.0,"When you browse a catalog of films (online or otherwise), the titles are usually arranged according to genre, such as drama, action, comedy, romance, etc. When it comes to Back To The Future, a copy would need to be put in almost every category, as it is perhaps the only film I have ever seen that almost completely defies the very notion of genre. That reason, among others, is why I consider this to be the finest film ever made.The basic story revolves around 1980s teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whose friendship with mad scientist ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) ends up with Marty in a time machine--made out of a Delorean!--whisked away to the year 1955, where he ""messes with the space-time continuum"" and must make sure that his parents meet and fall in love once again, thus assuring his own existence.That relatively simple concept contains so, so much more in terms of overall entertainment. It is hilarious, romantic, dramatic, and full of action and adventure in equal measure. The acting is also some of the best that cinema has to offer. While Fox and Lloyd are now iconic as the leads, the trio of Lea Thompson (playing Lorraine Baines), Crispin Glover (George McFly), and Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen) almost steal the show on certain occasions with their various personalities. Even the ""bit players"" are superb in their short, yet very important/meaningful appearances.Perhaps the most impressive thing about this entire film experience, though, is the detail put into each and every scene. One must pay close attention to every single detail (no matter how small or seemingly inane) of every single scene in the 1980s-portion of the film in order to better understand the jokes and sight gags of the 1950s-era time frame. I have watched this film at least a dozen or more times all the way through, yet on each viewing I find something new that I seemed to have missed.Finally, the screenplay from ""the Bob's"" (Zemeckis & Gale) is perfect. I say that without hyperbole. There is simply not a wasted line or scene in the entire picture. Everything has meaning in some way, shape, or form that is paid off further down the road.Whenever I watch ""Back To The Future"", its roughly 2-hour runtime seems to absolutely fly by. It is so perfectly paced, with each scene expertly transitioning into the next, that there's never an iota of chance you'll be taken out of the experience in any way. It is the very best that cinema has to offer on all fronts."
28.11.2017,10.0,"Parents need to know that Back to the Future is a family time-travel favorite that includes sequences that place the hero and his friends in physical jeopardy: an attack in which a sympathetic character is thought to be killed, a van chasing a teen on a skateboard, several episodes of bullying, and more. The violence is exaggerated and closer in tone to cartoon jeopardy than real danger, but some kids will no doubt find it tense. Several scenes show the hero's discomfort when the girl who will eventually be his mother tries to entice him with kisses and embraces; there's also a scene in which the beginnings of an assault on a high school girl are shown; she struggles/expresses fear, but intervention prevents anything else from happening."
05.11.2017,10.0,"Having watched this movie for the first time, as a 25 year old, I was uncertain whether I'd actually enjoy this movie due to 1- My age, and 2 - The age of the movie...I needn't have worried!The movie holds up well in terms of special effects, which I was not expecting.The story is exciting and fun, the cast is brilliant and this is an all round great family movie - possibly the best!10/10. It's got everything!"
02.10.2017,8.0,"One of the most Popular Movies of all Time. It is a Safe, Feel-Good Family Entertainment from Spielberg's Sublime ""Suburban"" Playground of Hits. It's the Backdrop the Master Manipulator Finds His Mega-Money-Makers the most Often.Robert Zemeckis was Hired to Direct based on His often Rejected Script (with Bob Gale) that Spielberg recognized as something Special.And Special it Turned Out to be. It has a Great Cast of Comedic Talent (Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Crispin Glover) feeling right at Home with the Story, and some Nifty State of the Art SFX.The Movie is a Slick Fun Time with all the Elements coming Together to make it an Ensemble Piece of Family Fodder that Charms with a Fast Pace, a bit of ""Fish Out of Water"" Edginess. Lea Thompson's Endearing Turn as Marty McFly's Mother is Great, but Nothing here will ever be Considered High-Art. Just a Clap-Trap Pleaser (Spielberg's Specialty) with High Commercial Value.The Product Placements are Over the Top.But the Many Pop Cultural References from the 80's and the 50's Assured, at the Time, that a Parent and Child from 1985 (the Heart of the Movie), can Enjoy this one Together, Dare it be Said, Into the Future."
21.09.2017,,"The thing that is GREAT about this movie is the adventure, and imagination. The only thing that I dislike about the movie is the swearing. The greatest time travel movie ever! A classic, can not be remade. Anybody, including YOU, will love it! I recommend this movie to anybody."
30.08.2017,10.0,"This movie is just too perfectly executed, and will always remain to be my favorite. There's too many good things to say about it. You just need to watch it, at least once in your life. All scenes of the movie are great, especially that Earth Angel scene. If you watched a lot of 80's movies, and this isn't one of them, whatever you do watch this, you will not be disappointed."
11.08.2017,9.0,"A great film which not only entertains but also makes you think, that is this possible? what if it is? but surely it cannot? such questions when come to your ind, you surely know its a beautiful film. All the series of this film are good. Characters are limited, story is simple and plot is awesome."
05.08.2017,2.0,"This is a time-travel adventure comedy film, set in California, starring Michael J. Fox. BTTF has a reputation as 'a film that's impossible to dislike'. We're supposed to ignore (or not notice) the plot holes and inconsistencies. I disliked this film when I watched it during my teens - and even more when I watched it during my twenties. I can't see how any adult can enjoy this childish nonsense."
14.07.2017,9.0,"Back To The Future is a perfect example of a film that gets better the more I watch it. With time travel, great characters and fantastic comedy it is no wonder it is considered a classic. Michael J. Fox plays fish out of water Marty Mc Fly perfectly when he is taken back to the year 1955 through Doc Brown's unorthodox time machine. Despite some unusual situations the film is able to keep a whimsical charm that many Spielberg produced films from the era possessed. Not to mention great direction from Robert Zemeckis who simultaneously captures the spirit of the 1980's through the character of Marty McFly as well as perfectly replicating the feel of the 1950s in the setting. While it can not be ignored the plot holes that would be apparent in any film involving travel to the past the film is such an enjoyable experience that I did not question it. With universal appeal to both children and adults through its clever humor and originality this will definitely be a classic for a long time to come. I would urge anyone that loves film that has not seen Back To The Future to seek it out immediately."
29.06.2017,8.0,"this movie is quite entertaining with all funny stuff in it. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod gave the audience a lot of comedy and little action pack (just a little not quite big) and they are work very good to bring the character up into that story as well. For me, that I didn't forget is an iconic theme song always ringing my ear, and that's remind me how funny is this movie and fun to watch!"
28.06.2017,10.0,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time traveling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways."
14.06.2017,7.0,"Back to the Future was a Movie which showed that time traveling was possible. In late 1985 they still made a pretty good Sci-Fi movie with some comedy, This movie was one of the best at its time and due to with other parts of the movies were also made,Converting a Car into a time Machine was pretty good idea and the Model of the Car was also best due to its time. love to watch again"
09.06.2017,6.0,SOME SPOILERS IN THIS ARTICLE this is a great movie about a boy that takes a time traveling car to the time his parents were sophomores and convinces them to dance together and that leads to them getting married and he saves himself from never getting born
29.05.2017,8.0,"BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) **** Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's ""It's a Wonderful Life""? Think about it. Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with TV's ""Family Ties"", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney). There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish. High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis. Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean. Oscar- nominated song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film. Classic.Also Dean Cundey as DP was fantastic! I saw his latest movie, 'Slamma Jamma' - just amazing DP!"
30.04.2017,10.0,"Time travel movies are always intriguing and make the audience wonder, would I ever visit the future or go back in time? This movie brings you into to the world of 'what could happen if someone really DID invent a time machine'. Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly who is a teen who gets into trouble and needs the help of Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. It's campy, hilarious, suspenseful, and fun. A must watch for fans of time travel movies!"
28.04.2017,10.0,Back to The Future was made a great Success by Mendocino California'sLocal Resident: Christopher Lloyd. He lives and resided in Mendocino for years and years and was/ is an very amazing and friendly Local. he would get coffee every morning at one of the local coffe shops.. It was so amzaing and fun to see him.
25.04.2017,8.0,"Back to the Future was released in July 1985 and is the story of Marty McFly played by Michael J. Fox. Marty ends up going back in time with his friend Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. Doc turned his DeLorean into a time machine powered by plutonium. They take the DeLorean back to 1955 and end up meeting Marty's parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson). While in 1955, Marty has to be sure that his teenage parents fall in love to make sure that he can make it back to 1985 alive. The theme of Back to the Future is the conversation about fate and free will. Are we all on a predetermined path that cannot change or do we have the power to change our future? Marty is able to go back to when his parents first met. As the movie progressed and his time in the past grew, he had to make sure that his parents would stay together to ensure that he had a future to go back to. Was it always supposed to be like that? In the 1955 that his parents remember before he was born, did he actually come from the future to keep them together? Or did he alter history? This is the question that is addressed in almost every movie about time travel. Do the effects of what you do in the past ripple through time toward the future?The effects of the movie were excellent for their time. The special effects used to transport the DeLorean back to 1955 made it look possible. Doc is the perfect mad scientist for the job. The DeLorean is just as crazy as him. With the switches and flashing lights, it is exactly what you would think a time machine to look like. The camera angles that are used in the movie give the viewer the experience of traveling through time. Cameras with the outside of the DeLorean in view during the time travel reveals the special effects used by the production to make it look like the car is actually traveling through the space-time continuum. Director Robert Zemeckis does a great job with the film to make the viewer think about the effects of the past on our future. If the past would change because of someone using time travel. Would it effect the future immediately? Or did the future already know about that change so nothing would change that we know of?"
17.04.2017,10.0,"What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award ""- winning team of Steven Spielberg"" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! """
11.04.2017,10.0,"I love the movie ""Back to the future"" for four reasons.First,this movie shows how you can travel to the future or last past and this movie gives you hope for time travel.Second,the scenery that was used in the movie is so fantastic,the directors were very creative when did the script and the scenes.Third,the movie has such great actors,they could interpret their characters very well as if it happened.Finally,the movie has continued,there are three sequels, so, each one is better than the other and shows different consequences to travel through the time!!"
08.04.2017,4.0,"This is one of those legendary films that for some reason I just hadn't seen. I have now! I don't think it could ever meet the hype that people put on it, but i can't deny that it is a good film, and certainly one of the iconic ones of the 80's.It's a bit overly long though, and I think it could have been in need of tighter editing, but you can't argue with the quality and performances given by the cast.I enjoyed this film, I thought it was clever, but I can't say it'll be a film I return to regularly."
05.04.2017,8.0,"This is one of those classic films I could watch over and over and never get tired of it. Seeing the way the story lined panned out in each film made you really want to see how crazy the next one would be. It has such a hilarious cast with unforgettable moments, makes me want to pop it in the DVD player now."
24.03.2017,9.0,"Released in 1985, ""Back to the Future"" stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teen who travels back to 1955 to meet his parents when they were teens (Crispin Glover & Lea Thompson). Christopher Lloyd plays the quirky Doc Brown while Thomas F. Wilson plays the villain, Biff. Claudia Wells is on hand as Marty's girlfriend.This is a clever, fun and insightful fantasy that addresses the power of decision at critical turning points in life. It's easily the best of the trilogy, although the second one is almost as good, albeit goofier and more frantic. Everything clicks for a thoroughly entertaining viewing experience. The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in South Pasadena, Pasadena, Whittier, Universal City, City of Industry, Newhall, Los Angeles, Burbank, Arleta and Chino, California. DIRECTOR: Robert Zemeckis. WRITERS: Zemeckis & Bob Gale. GRADE: A"
22.03.2017,9.0,"""Back to the Future"" is a quintessential '80s movie and '50s throwback that's fun for people of any and all ages, but it's also the first film to harness the concept of time travel in a universally human way.Time travel is both a critical and unessential part of the movie. Nearly everything that makes the movie fun and interesting comes from the time travel conceit, but the reason Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels into the past is accidental. Instead of traveling into the past to improve his life or fix a mistake – a much more obvious kind of wish fulfillment – Marty is inadvertently forced to save someone else's life, and ultimately preserve his own existence.Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale aren't necessarily searching for something profound with their screenplay, which is kind of what makes its deeply resonant and occasionally insightful moments so much more effective. The joy of watching the film is being entertained by the fun of it all and kind of incidentally uncovering the moments that move you or make you think with each viewing. Before you know it, you're biting your nails waiting for Marty to patch everything up in the space-time continuum and make it to the clock tower on time. Zemeckis' direction isn't particularly noteworthy, but he really works the emotional turning points of the script, maximizing the ""payoff moments"" for the audience.The cultural phenomenon of it all starts with Marty McFly. It's crazy to think that filming had been going on for weeks with Eric Stoltz playing Marty and only when that didn't work out did Fox get the part. He just exudes cool and in a timeless manner that allows ""Back to the Future"" to hold up more than 30 years later. He's tremendously likable, he rides a skateboard in an awesome way that we still haven't seen in the movies since, and he's brazen and defiant of authority in the way that most teenagers only dream of. Outcasts in the '50s couldn't stand up to bullies like Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) yet Marty does and becomes an instant hero in the eyes of anyone who's ever been bullied.The dynamic between Marty and the teenage version of his father, George (Crispin Glover) lies at the heart of the ""Back to the Future."" Although their relationship could definitely have been given more attention in the present day scenes, the fact that we know he's a man who gets completely walked over as an adult suffices. Really, it's George we identify with – the science-fiction nerd who struggles with rejection – and Marty represents the confident version of ourselves we so often strive to be. The wish fulfillment of the movie is about seeing the physical embodiment of that projection of ourselves (in Marty) making the weak George a stronger person.Marty's reactions with his younger mother (Lea Thompson) go the more comical, Oedipal route, but also there is this idea that our parents were teenagers too once, and they had their own struggles with contemporary living and authority. The fact that Marty has to help her and his father fall in love requires the kind of empathy we so rarely have for our parents as teenagers, and so much of the emotion of the film comes from watching that play out (not to mention the wish fulfillment of the popular Lorraine falling for the meek George).Then there's Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who is essentially the movie's mascot. He's thought of as a main character and everything builds toward saving him, but he's not all that integral to the human element of the story. He facilitates a lot of exposition, however, and it's his compassion toward Marty in the '50s timeline that endear us to him as much as it is his memorable lines, fabulous expressions and winks toward the camera. The iconography of the film really defies explanation. The DeLorean, Marty's outfit/skateboarding, the Huey Lewis soundtrack and, most importantly, Marty rocking out to ""Johnny B. Goode"" at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, are so effortlessly perfect yet inessential components to the film's success. What this suggests is that the right combination of story and talent can infuse even the smallest details of a film with a paradigmatic energy that makes that detail feel classic or quintessential. In spite of stalling the plot, the ""Johnny B. Goode"" scene works because of the schism in time rooted in the time travel story. Marty's line ""your kids are gonna love it"" perfectly encapsulates that sentiment.In this way and others, ""Back to the Future"" defies most models of great filmmaking. It both captured the zeitgeist of its era (and of the '50s) while creating its own. Its footprint on culture is unmistakably large and its timelessness is both mystifying and yet ingeniously apropos.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
20.03.2017,10.0,"Quite possibly, and quite probably, my favourite film of all time is ""Back to the Future"", released on 3 July 1985, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. The film stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and Crispin Glover, and features a score composed by Alan Silvestri. ​Writing is an essential part of filmmaking, and the script in ""Back to the Future"" is nearly a perfect one. Of course, in a time travel film, the appearance of inconsistencies, paradoxes, and other similar errors are almost inevitable. But, on first viewing ""Back to the Future"", and even for subsequent viewings, these plot holes aren't very noticeable due to the engaging story. The film explains the science of its time travel perfectly, with lengthy but fast- paced exposition. ​Marty, played by Michael J. Fox, is a likable and relatable protagonist. At the time of filming, Fox was busy working on the NBC sitcom ""Family Ties"", and so director Robert Zemeckis and producer Bob Gale hired young actor Eric Stoltz to fill in the part. A few weeks into filming, Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg decided that Stoltz just wasn't the actor they needed. Pushing back the film's release date and adding $3 million to its budget, they recast Fox as Marty under the condition that Fox would work on ""Family Ties"" during the day and ""Back to the Future"" at night. Fox often slept on the way to the film's shooting locations.Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, is both interesting and funny to watch. His long explanations of his work, along with his misunderstandings of what the future is like, make for plenty of amusing and intriguing dialogue. George McFly, played by Crispin Glover, is likable in his awkwardness and inflections. ​The film's antagonist, Biff Tannen, played by Thomas F. Wilson is a fantastically well-acted character that a viewer loves to hate. His arrogant nature and loudmouth remarks easily allow the audience to want to see him defeated by the end of the movie. The beautiful Lorraine Baines-McFly, played by Lea Thompson, also offers a great performance, both as her teenage and middle-aged selves, adding more comedy to the table. ​The music for the film is also spectacular. The score to ""Back to the Future"" was composed by Alan Silvestri. Silvestri's compositions for the film are orchestrated expertly, and the main theme carries a sense of adventure and awe. The songs ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back in Time"" by Huey Lewis and the News, created specifically for this film, fit well and are great to listen to on their own. The tracks covered by the fictional band Marvin Berry and the Starlighters are excellent renditions of the real-life oldies. ""Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)"", originally by the Penguins, earned actor Harry Waters, Jr. a gold record certification, and rightly so. Chuck Berry's famous rock and roll tune ""Johnny B. Goode"" (performed in the film by Marty McFly, but dubbed over by Mark Campbell) adds a great musical scene and leads to a terrific comedic moment. ​The visual effects work in the film is always a treat. Three DeLorean cars were purchased to be modified for the film. The DeLorean time machine was designed by Ron Cobb, Andrew Probert, and Michael Scheffe, while effects supervisor Kevin Pike helped build the time machines. The flying DeLorean at the end of the film was created by the wonderful people at Industrial Light & Magic.The DeLorean is an aesthetically cool-looking car, and a far better choice than what was originally intended. When envisioning the film, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had a time machine made from a fridge in mind. They decided to pass on the idea, since it could lead to inspired children getting stuck in refrigerators. The film's title was even a stroke of genius that had some concept issues. Sid Sheinberg, head of Universal Pictures, made some helpful alterations to the script, but insisted that the film be called Spaceman from Pluto. Subsequently, Steven Spielberg sent him a memo that implied that the crew thought it was a joke, and Sheinberg decided sheepishly to drop the idea.The set of Hill Valley was shot at the Courthouse Square backlot of Universal Studios. It was used in numerous films aside from ""Back to the Future"", including ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) and ""Gremlins"" (1984). The scenes in the film that took place during 1955 were shot first in the beautified backlot. For the scenes in 1985, the crew simply trashed and uglified the square, like leaving garbage on the streets and replacing classic motion pictures on a movie theatre sign with sleazy titles. Industrial Light & Magic animation supervisor Wes Takahashi created the lightning effects for the climactic clock tower scene by hand, which is an impressive and awesome-looking achievement. ​In finality, ""Back to the Future"" is a contemporary classic. Its acting, direction, music, visual effects, editing, sound mixing, and most importantly, screen writing, all lend to it being an engaging, story-and-character driven film. It has marvelous foreshadowing, superb character development, and a well-structured story without any unnecessary scene; whatever few problems it could have are insignificant, and there may be no film I enjoy more."

16.02.2017,10.0,"I watched all the Back to The Future movies and must say that they are far ahead of their time and I found them incredibly interesting. The plot is engaging and the characters are really likable! I am writing this in 2017 and yet Back to The Future remains one of my favorite movies of all time, although it has to compete with nowadays technology and amazing animations. It is the kind of movie you can watch with the entire family and even though the plot is thick and twisted, for a movie that plays with time, everything is really easy to follow.If you haven't seen it yet, I definitely recommend it!"
05.02.2017,10.0,"If there is one movie that I think of when someone asks me, ""What is the best, most enjoyable movie ever made?"" back to the future is the first movie that comes to mind. Not only is it endlessly re watchable, but it is gripping from start to finish and ANYONE who likes movies to any degree owes it to themselves to see this masterpiece. Any age can enjoy it, as it isn't too dumb for adults and isn't too smart for children. Every character has a unique purpose, so the movie doesn't feel bare or overcrowded. The music is arguably the best movie soundtrack of all time, as it incorporates all emotions that the movie portrays in one, consistent tone. The only problems with this movie are minor goofs/issues that you most likely won't even notice even if you are looking for them. If you haven't seen this yet, you are obligated to do so."

05.01.2017,9.0,"A humorous sci-fi movie! Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox excelled at there roles. They worked together so well that I couldn't imagine any other two people for there characters. The director did a fabulous job, he picked a wonderful cast and of course can't forget the crew that does most of the dirty work. Wouldn't it be so amazing to travel back in time. Marty (Michael J Fox) learns this lesson all to well as he finds himself needing to fix a few things in his past. Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) really adds the humor to this movie, his character is a bit weird I should say but hands down one heck of a funny guy. This movie never gets old, I have watched it over 20 times and still can't get enough of it. Enjoy this movie, it's one of a kind for sure."
03.01.2017,10.0,"Back to the future is my Favorite movie of all time for many many reasons. This was a film I really wished i grew up with because this is the finest piece of work in film-making I have ever seen.I love everything about this movie from the amazing story, to the amazing characters, Jokes, Romance, set pieces you name it!.The acting is top notch and you really feel for the characters in the film. The main character Marty Mcfly is a friendly,likable funny guy who's family isn't the greatest, His father is a loser who lack confidence and is always picked on by Biff who is a nasty person who only thinks for himself. His Mother is a drinker and is never really happy or upbeat. His brother also has a lame job in delivering pizzas.Marty is told by Doc brown (who is really funny and interesting) that he has made a time machine into a car. Marty then travels back in time from 1985 to 1955 because of being in a tight problem after the doc gets killed by a bunch of gang members. I won't tell you what happens in the rest of the story but it's something you have to see to believe. The writing in the film is tight and I can watch this film many times without getting bored and finding new things within the film that I have missed the first few times I watched it. It's a film that anybody can enjoy.The first film in the series will always be the best and while the 2nd and 3rd movies were very good follow ups. This movie will always be the best one. Watch this movie if you haven't already."
11.12.2016,9.0,"There are some movies that you can view again and again especially when you grew up in the 80's. The films that came to mind also helped me remember childhood memories from the first viewing of Top Gun, Beetle Juice, The Breakfast Club, and the movie I most recently viewed Back to the Future with Michael J. Fox. As I viewed Back to the Future again, I could view the components that kept my attention back from younger years and even to this day. The movie's central focus was on a teenager, Marty that had a crazy scientist friend Dr. Brown. Although he was told not to associate with the scientist by the principle, Marty being the typical teenager, that didn't stop him. The story goes on leading you through scenes of the upbeat life style of a teenager of the 80's ridding his skate board as the sound of rock-n-roll music drowned all noises except the his interactions with his parents and a bully named Biff. The excitement rises as Marty goes to visit Dr. Brown, clocks ticking, alarms sounding, music sets the emotion of excitement. Marty meets up with Dr. Brown and witnesses the Dr.'s latest experiment called time travel. The theme is pronounced throughout the movie. Director, Robert Zemeckis introduces the characters and their change with time only in reverse. The first introduction of the characters playing Marty's parents are in a present time, 1985. Stories are vocalized by the mother of how the she first met their father George, ugh. Marty and his sister, Linda are very tired of listening to this story. Editing brings this scene to the viewer's attention using outside/in, leading you into another scene further in the movie. Lighting of the film was appropriately placed as scenes changed, from time travel full of sound and colors to the settings of past, 1955 colors to the more flaming colors of the present, 1985. The excitement begins when Marty witnesses Dr. Brown being shot by foreign terrorists. The dramatic sound as shots being fired, music tone drops in the scene only to transition to a faster tempo matched the pace with the scene as the terrorists begin to chase after Marty. Marty jumps into the DeLorean/ time machine and the chase begins. Continued are angled views through Marty's eyes of the digital displayed date and year with another date and year set back to 1955. The sounds of screeching tires and gun shots along with a fast-paced music sets for excited emotions with Marty speeding from his predators. The focus changes quickly and the angle of the speedometer comes to focus as it reaches 88 mph and with the sounds of a screeching swoosh, as the burning flames ignite sending Marty back in time. Upon his arrival in 1955, unexpectedly Marty is lead to his parents in the time they were teenagers. As the story proceeds it gathers your thoughts from a previous transition of editing scenes from the introduction and conversations of how the parents met. Marty, accidentally runs into his father, George at the town's local dinner. Curiosity leads Marty to follow George as he leaves, setting the transition of editing back to the time when George was hit by a car and met his mother. Only leading into more action. Marty interacts with the past occurrence and pushes his father to safety and gets hit by the car himself. Scenes begin to twist with the time, as his mother, Lorraine is introduced as a teenager to Marty who is now in place of George, as his mother, Lorraine now develops a crush on Marty. Conflicting thoughts and transitional emotions of the Marty taking place of George with is Lorraine. Marty must re-start time or find a way of bring his parents back to the first time they met or the family will disappear in the present time, 1985. The director doesn't let go of the movie's theme from scene to scene with the continued views of clocks and sounds of ticking, transitioning from the development of change from time and place. The director uses adult and teenage ethics and thoughts that change the emotional views through the movie. The action and excitement kept my attention from the first time I saw the movie to the most recent time. Even with a new-found viewing I've learning from the class of Film Appreciation. As I analyzed my viewing, I found the movie was one that I enjoyed to watch and continue to find entertaining. Back to the Future (1985) continues to be a movie to be viewed."
11.12.2016,8.0,"Back to the Future is one of those classic films that you'll remember for years to come. Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox), an American teenager living in the 80's gets sent back thirty years to 1955 in a silver DeLorean that is actually a time machine. With the help of Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), the creator of the time machine, Marty must make sure his teenage parents fall in love so that he will return to the future and regular life.One of the themes that came to mind quickly is that Marty sees his father (Crispin Glover) when he was a teenager completely different then he sees him now. So, the theme revolves around, would Marty have been friends with his father when he was the same age and gone to school together? Marty sees his dad as a scared person that told on people when they did something wrong. He was terrified of Lorraine, which is Marty's mom in the present. At the beginning of the movie, Marty had a firm mind-set of his father, but when he traveled back in time to see his father as a teenager, that all changed.One of the techniques that was used in the film that really stood out to me was the sound effects. Especially in the scene where Marty is being chased on the hover boards, the sound effects that were put in place for when Marty was pushing himself with his foot and when the hover board was ""flying"" were appropriate for the action scene. Also, when the DeLorean was going back in time, the sound effects that were used to give you the elution that he was zooming through time was perfect for the overall affect."
09.12.2016,8.0,"Back to the Future, is a highly enjoyable movie. That can be enjoyed,and appreciated, by both adults and children. The two main characters,Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, and Emmett Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, showed me they had great chemistry together. Swear words, where said in moderation. Compared to some movies, I have saw, the language in this movie, is like words, from a Church Hymnal. And as far as any violence in this movie, it was in the same category as a ""Road Runner,"" and ""Coyote,"" cartoon. To keep from sounding like a hypocrite, I would take my kids to this movie. (I am sure, they heard swear words before). So much for the language. I loved the sound effects, as well as the special effects, of this movie. It was sort of accelerating to hear, those lightning bolts crackle. And to see, that time vortex swirling around. It almost had me feel as though, I was being whisk into the future. The performances of Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Lea Thompson, who played Lorraine Mcfly. And Crispin Glover, who played George Mcfly were excellent. Especially, Crispin Glover, who kept this movie, on the right track. Even though, this move has a PG rating, parents should be for-warned, that there are some contents, of sexual nature in this movie. I personally think that Back to the Future, should have had a PG-13 rating. Oh, I know that it was not so sexually explicit, that it would be condemned by the Vatican. But, I am just putting myself, in the minds of some parents. And I also know, you can't please everybody all the time. Speaking for myself, I do not have a ""Hollier than thou""attitude, about this movie. Back to the Future, is a fun movie. To put this movie in perspective. I would recommend, taking the entire family to see Back to the Future. And I can almost guarantee, that your kids will not leave the theater corrupted."
06.12.2016,10.0,"Back to the Future (1985) is one of my favorite sci-fi adventure comedies of all times. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I first seen this film when it came out in the 80's. I have watched it several times since then, as well as the 2 sequels. I watched this film again for my Art of Films class and was just as entertained this time as all the other times I had seen it; it never gets old.Michael J Fox, one of my favorite actors, plays the role of Marty McFly. Marty is a 17-year-old teenage boy who travels back in time to 1955 by jumping into the DeLorean when trying to escape from the men that shot his friend Dr. Emmet Brown, who is played by Christopher Lloyd. The action and suspense throughout this movie still excites me to this day. The film gives you the feeling of being part of the movie by relating you to the characters. Teenagers today can relate to Marty and his feelings of his parents. It is hard to imagine your parents being anything but your parents. This film is filled with moral implications such as the consequences that can happen when you bully others and the social problems that we all deal with in high school."
16.10.2016,10.0,"With the amount of time, work and effort Michael J. Fox has put into his acting, he's always been a person to look up to. Plus his birthday and middle name is easy enough to remember, it's the same as mine, laugh out loud. M.J. Fox and D.J. Docs. Out of all the TV Series and Films Michael has stared in, my favourite of all times being, Back To The Future both I, II & III, they are the best ones of all films of all times, as with the story line, set up, editorial work and mostly acting from all actors, there wasn't one single mistake whatsoever. Family Ties is a TV series that should be back on TV in the UK too, as some of the shows they have on TV could do with being wiped off altogether, after all with Happy Days being on, which my little girls love, I'm sure if they were to bring on Family Ties, they'd be just as happy, as they're also fans of Back To The Future as well."
07.10.2016,10.0,"!!!!!!1.21 JIGA-WATTS!!!!!!""If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 MPH...you're gonna see some serious sh**.""""Calm down Marty I didn't disintegrate anything, the molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact - Yeah, well where the hell are they - The appropriate question is WHEN the hell are they"".Back To The Future is one of the most original films ever made and also as one of the most entertaining and this masterpiece of Sci-Fi has long stood as a collective triumph for the careers of Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Robert Zemeckus. Released in mid-1985, met with rousing popular and critical acclaim, which proved to be a goldmine for Universal Studio, who made two more (less good) sequels some years later. In this movie you'll see a combination of some of the best and most lively acting ever captured on film by a perfectly chosen cast, many of which play dual-roles to great effect. Plus, for this sci-fi classic, a profoundly brilliant and singularly witty screenplay masterfully guides the flow of things to come (and that which what has already happened - in the past), which is a confoundingly complex and interwoven series of twists and turns, so many, in fact, that only a mere handful of movie's have more. Largely due to it's brilliant writing (and great line readings) Back To The Future is easily one of the most quotable films ever made (perhaps only GHOSTBUSTERS packs more quotes) and that particularly holds true for Doc Brown, who not only has most of the movies best lines, but also puts the most enthusiasm into said lines. At the heart of the film is a unique, one-of-a-kind vehicle (a HEAVILY MODIFIED DeLorian) of Doc Brown's creation, (without it there would be no Back To The Future) that enables it's operator to travel any where in time AND in highly dramatic fashion an unlucky Marty McFly does just that - and not exactly by design. I find that the car makes some of the sweetest sounding vehicular sounds ever and I always wondered if were hearing the live sound or was it over-dubbed in post production. Either which way, a plethora of amazing engine sounds (do I detect a turbine whine?) emanate from under the ""trunk"" as DeLorian's are indeed a rear engine design; especially after Doc Brown's handy-work!For a Sci-Fi film, the special effects in Back To The Future are unusually sparse in their application (though brilliantly effective when they are used), you might even say that their under-used, but if at any time you sit back and analyze what you're seeing, eventually you'll realize it's really more of a ""human drama"" than a Sci-Fi film. Musically speaking, along with Huie Luis and the News, Back To The Future is powerfully enhanced by an amazingly effective and mostly up-beat score by a young Alan Silvestre; just listen to how grandly effective his music is during the finale when combined with, A: the variety of sounds from the car and B: the crushing and unrelenting thunder from the storm that rages over Hill Valley (another early triumph, from yet another artist who had a leading hand in the making of this iconic and universally popular film). Speaking of THAT finale, Back To The Future's rip-roaring, high-voltage, thunder n' lightning finale, is easily one of the -most exciting- sequences ever devised (year after year it's the ONLY part of ANY movie that routinely makes the hair on my arms stand up - every time I see it). Unfortunately the two sequels that followed in 89' and 90' are not as good as this, but are pretty good for sequels.Brilliant in every conceivable way, this time-travel-blockbuster-spectaculaire remains one of cinema's brightest triumphs of creative film-making."
02.10.2016,9.0,"I can rarely ever watching anything twice, let a lot three times and I'll watch this movie at least once a year. It's just such a great feel good movie and the casting of all the characters is just so perfect. Also I'm not a fan of sequels but its different for this. It feels more like one long story spread out across three movies then the typical ""revival"" of a film.I would recommend this film to just about anybody! It doesn't matter if your a kid or retired, you'll probably enjoy and appreciate how advanced this movie was for its time."
29.09.2016,10.0,"the movie is great, Its story is very amusing for a kid like me. The characters are very interesting, Especially Doc. If time travel would be possible, I would put myself to where the movie has been shot, To see how the did the dis-and-reappearing of the time machine.What I do want to know is why the movie's been shot in California, How important is that place for the movie? Well, I guess i'll have to find that out later... Well then... The movie is just very catchy, And I've seen the whole trilogy. Pretty amazing if you ask me. I look foreward to seeing the movies all by myself! I really enjoy sience-fiction on its own so that wont be hard! To be honest, Please people, Watch this, It just the best movie ever.Anyway, This is Red, Enjoy your movies! And peace out!"
29.09.2016,8.0,"One of the most iconic movies of the 80s . I was born in 88 but i seen this movie a lot, and Michael J Fox just kills it when he plays Marty McFly. Its also hilarious how his mother in the 50's calls him Calvin Klien because of whats on his underpants. I also love it when doc brown says that he needs 1.21 gigglewats to make the car go .If you also a fan of Drake and josh they even made a reference to the car in the Christmas episode movie. My favorite scene is at the dance scene where George finally stands up to Biff and punches him, and kisses Lorane to finally make things right . I also love the song Earth Angel .Even if your not a 80s kid you should definitely check it out. Because its such a great film to make it a movie night."
28.09.2016,9.0,"I should be kicking myself for not watching this movie much earlier.It was amazing to watch ,The Jokes,References,Performance e.t.c. were spot on .I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking to watch an adventure/comedy movie.This fits the bill.Michael j.Fox was so good and so was Christopher Lloyd.Some of the jokes really crack you up.For a 1980's movie it is pretty awesome and the best thing about the movie that anyone can enjoy this movie regardless of their personal tastes .It is like one of those iconic movies like Star Wars,Indiana Jones which are pure classics .Some Scenes were funny and awkward at the same time but you can forgive the awkwardness for the master piece that this movie is.It is a Cult Classic .The references in this movie are so funny it and the humour really works pretty well.The chemistry between Micheal J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd is great .Michael J.fox as Marty Mcfly owns the movie with his charisma and raw energy.I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is even considering to watch this movie."
05.09.2016,10.0,"Back to the Future is hard to describe......imaginative? Yes. Cool? Yes. Hilarious creative sci-fi film? There we go! This is the best time travel movie of all-time, with no doubt. I'll Explain. Well played stereotypes: Yep. Especially the mid 50s stereotypes. Good acting: Yeah! Feels realistic. Aging: It never gets old, I watch it almost every time I get to do it. For kids: Noo. 12 or 13+ in my opinion.But still, this movie does it and is way better than the DC crap coming out recently. I advise you to rent Back to the Future from Amazon or Blockbuster (is that still around). I have a good feeling this film will last for generations and generations to come. 10/10."
05.09.2016,10.0,"I admit to having grown up on 1980s films and thus having a special admiration for them. Whichever way you look at it, BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era, a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.The underrated Michael J. Fox stars in the role of his life as Marty McFly, a guy who unwisely gets involved in time travel thanks to the machinations of his kooky inventor buddy, Doc Brown. Christopher Lloyd essays this subsidiary character and, again, it's the role of his life; he's over the top in it but nonetheless his character is thoroughly endearing and never less than hilarious.The time travel aspects of the storyline are carefully worked out and hold together very well even today, some 30 years after release. What I particularly liked about this film is the calibre of the writing: there's no slow spots or simplicity here, just one suspenseful sub-plot after another. There are small moments, big set-pieces, cutting edge special effects, action, chase scenes, romance, and of course plenty of humour, and a quirky supporting cast who make the most of their roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic - and for good reason."
29.08.2016,,"all seems great. the idea, the script, the acting, the details who define each period. and the flavor of ""50's in the most realistic manner to define it. sure, it is the result of a happy meeting between a courageous and real great director and the best actors for its project around a dream who is preserved by the imagination of each from us. but not the idea is the most important thing. the mixture of humor, tension, cultural references, the chemistry - yes, the word sounds strange but in this case is the best - between Christopher Lloyd and Michael Fox , the wise use of clichés about teenagers and family, the ignored guy who becomes hero, all make the story to roll in amazing manner. so, a sort of masterpiece. and one of the most adorable meet with a film. off course, a legendary one."
10.08.2016,10.0,"Back to the Future is popcorn entertainment brought to its absolute pinnacle in fun, color, romance and gorgeous, spirited music that has helped this movie become an all renowned classic that stands out from every other film in the 1980s. Robert Zemeckis directs the hell out of this masterpiece, and he sees time-travel as a fun and conceptual playground for character exploration and never ignoring any one line of dialogue. It's all just so... GOOD! Back to the Future has been referred to many times as one of the finest and most fun movies ever created by human talent, and I think that the praise is well-deserved for this funny, character-centric, feel-good and adventurously exciting movie. 80s galore at its absolute finest in this movie, and a movie that has aged beautifully; a movie truly ahead and outside of our time.If you haven't seen Back to the Future yet, then what the hell are you doing reading this? Get to work!"
09.08.2016,10.0,"Even 31 years after its initial release, Back to the Future has stood the test of time! There is absolutely no possible way ANYONE could hate this movie, and there are 3 reasons why!The first reason why Back to the Future is an impossible movie to hate is that its story is very original and doesn't seem to be hard for anyone to understand! A small-town California teen named Marty McFly is thrown back into the '50s when an experiment by his eccentric scientist friend Doc Brown goes awry. Traveling through time in a modified DeLorean car, Marty encounters young versions of his parents, and must make sure that they fall in love or he'll cease to exist. Even more dauntingly, Marty has to return to his own time and save the life of Doc Brown. One of the greatest aspects of the story is the idea of a teenager and a scientist traveling back in time in a DeLorean, which I have to imagine is the only instance of a movie making heavy use of a car as a way to travel through time. Another great aspect of the story is its message which argues that you can travel back in time to the years when your parents were teenagers, and straighten them out right at the moment when they needed help the most.The second reason why Back to the Future is an impossible movie to hate is the amount of memorable scenes and quotes that anyone who has seen the movie knows the most about! One of the most memorable scenes is when Doc tests out his time machine while Marty uses a video camera to record it. Doc tells Marty that if his calculations are correct, ""when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***!"" The final reason why Back to the Future is impossible to hate is the amazing design that delves into the 1950's era with a flourish and takes you to the unknown future with creative flare. Robert Zemeckis sure did a great job at directing every single aspect of the movie, but he was more efficient in directing the visual style of the film was that allowed audiences to experience the culture and nostalgia of the 1950s in a humorous way!"
27.07.2016,9.0,"Time travel movies never disappoint that is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another.""Back to The Future"" to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming art of a newer generation.

The action and suspense of this film still excites to this day."
24.07.2016,10.0,"Back to the Future is the movie which completely changed my thought that new movie is better than old one. My father likes these old films, while I had preferred late ones until I watched this. When I went back my parent's home for the first time in a few months, I found this film DVD by chance. At the moment I watched this film, I realized the value of old movies. At the same time I comes to want to watch more movies. In not recent movies, technology, such as a quality of visual clearness, is inferior to later movies, of course. It is not matter. The story line of Back to the Future is much more interesting. This is the best in time travel movies ever."
29.06.2016,9.0,"Real good movie, haven't seen it in a while but I want to see it again. i think every child should see this and I think every parent should let their child see this, it is truly a reflection on how when the people were making this movie what they thought we would have today but seeing as to how we pretty much have nothing they thought we would have, you see kinda how times changed from then to now. Also, can I be the first one to say that their hover board are cooler than ours, their hover boards actually hover meanwhile what we call a hover board, has wheels and is not at all hovering. Also, why aren't time machines invented yet. They are pretty much essential to my life but i don't have one :("
23.05.2016,10.0,"words can not express how amazing this film is. it is part of culture and is one of the greatest movies ever. in this timeless classic, an average teen, Marty who has an average life. except for the fact his best friend is a mad scientist named doctor Emmett brown. one day, he leans the doctor has invented a time traveling machine....out of a 1985 delorean. after a test it works. but in a turn of catastrophic events, Marty is driving for his life and makes a big mistake. he accidentally time travels to 1955. he should be able to get back, but he is out of fuel or plutonium. he ends up running in to both of his parents. but gets in the way of them ever meeting which puts his very existence in jeopardy. so he must get his parents together, find 1955 Emmett to help him, and get home. this is truly a work of art. is is a masterpiece in film."
21.05.2016,8.0,A film i first saw when i was seven still stands up as one of my top ten films. with the clever cinematography and inventive ideas makes it entertaining and nostalgic to watch. the story is one that is at times.Ease to relate to while at the same time transports you to a different place.if you haven't already i definitely recommend watching it asap.Its the type of film i wish someone didn't make cause i want to but i guess its to late for that.5 words that i would use to describe this film. fun creative entertain timeless nostalgic.if that hasn't convinced you that it is worth a watch i don't know what will.
30.04.2016,10.0,Just watching this got me hooked in! It was very good from the start to the finish. Once i watched the rest i wanted them to release even more of the film like maybe a forth and fifth trilogy. I think that the best has to be so far episode 3 because it is the most exciting with all of the time travel. I could watch it over and over again. I would definitely watch this as it is an amazing film and that there is even more to come in the next episodes of back to the future and that is why i rate it a ten. If you are into an action packed film and want to get up with the family then this is a perfect film to watch. I have been very engaged with it.
26.04.2016,10.0,"When it comes to not only incredible storytelling yet a truly great example of what a film should be, this and the entire trilogy define an undeniably 'timeless' experience that are forever lasting. Few times does a story introduce characters the way in which this does while at the same time delicately setting up what will become larger plot points. At every turn, there's another little surprise that lures the viewer in more and more. I think what's most profound here as opposed to other films similar to the genre is that although it's about time travel, it's moreover about people and relationships over anything else. Somehow, the writers prevent the story from getting bogged down in technical jargon and instead have smartly allowed the story of these characters to be present above all else. In summation, constantly entertaining and forever remarkable."
22.04.2016,8.0,"Back to the future"" is a lesson in movie-making. The script is really good, the director (Zemeckis) does what is expected of him, and the cast is perfect for the characters.The story itself is hardly original, but how it is told is outstanding. Not only that this film is funny, it succeeds in creating a certain atmosphere that is hard to describe. An atmosphere that you can feel and which distinguishes good movies from classics. You really connect with all the characters on screen. Zemeckis' first & only choice was Michael J. Fox for the role of Marty. Marty McFly is the part Fox was born to play, but there are other great performances here, as well. Christopher Lloyd is excellent as ""Doc"" Brown, and Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson also help to make this a very entertaining movie. There is an extra attraction here for those of us who can remember the 1950's, and some of the gags based on Fox's out-of-time character are classic. Also, this movie is recognizable by his amazing soundtrack composed by Alan Silvestri, including ""Power of Love,"" by Huey Lewis and the News. The track was a billboard charter at the time of the film, and it's rhythm and beat are still catchy. Overall, it's a good sci-fi film with the right amount of tension and laughs, and even some really touching moments.Overall rating: 8 out of 10."
18.04.2016,8.0,"Good, fun movie. Original plot, solidly directed. Good special effects, especially for 1985. The movie made Michael J Fox's career, and it is not difficult to see why. He gives a clever, energetic performance as Marty McFly. However, he is almost upstaged by a superb over-the-top performance by Christopher Lloyd.Good support from Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson.A pity that the producers felt the need to make a sequel, and then another. Neither came anywhere near the tight, original plot of the first, and just seemed like retreads. The third movie was particularly pointless."
21.03.2016,10.0,"This is one of the most perfect scripts in cinema. Perfect from the script, to casting, directing, acting, editing, and even the score. When I watch this movie I see genius at its finest. What I really love is how they shot for 6 weeks with Eric Stoltz, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale ultimately decided that they needed to go into another direction. Michael J. Fox operating on almost zero rest between shooting Family Ties and Back to the Future puts one of the best modern day characters. He and Christopher Lloyd bring us down the rabbit hole for a wonderful adventure that brings you happiness and laughter. Thank you to Mr. Zemeckis and Mr. Gale for this great movie and timeless classic."
22.02.2016,8.0,Love this movie! It was entertaining and exciting to watch. It was very interesting to how this screenplay was made. I wonder how long it took to write this movie and conceptualize it. I recommend everyone to watch this movie not just one time but as many times you can possibly watch it. Its a great movie to watch with the entire family. All the actors were awesome in it and the ending and special effects were amazing. It was pretty cool that they were able to make several movies based on the original movie. I wonder how they were able to come up with such a movie. It was pretty amazing. They should make more movies like this truly an original movie and to think they made a time machine out of a Delorean car. How cool is that?
10.02.2016,10.0,It's about time you see Back to the future it's about a scientist called Dr. Emmett Brown showed a teenager a time machine powered by plutonium the teenager name is Marty Mcfly. The problem is that the mom and the dad are not getting married. They are actors.The special effects are awesome. I recommend it for 6 or more years old. There are 3 parts 1st Marty goes to the past second they both go to the future. On the third part they go to the past. My favorite part was when Marty uses photo to see how much time they have together as a family.the good thing is it is easy to make predichens about the next part. It is 100% awesome.
29.01.2016,9.0,"Now more than 30 years after its release it's virtually impossible to review BTTF and say something that is new. Almost all observations of the film have already been made and the chance that my review will seem stale and familiar has put me off for years, but now is the time to finally get it done.Since there are as-of-yet undiscovered tribes in the heart of the Amazon jungle who already know the plot of Back to the Future I will forgo typing out a synopsis. Time travel is a tricky device when plotting movies. It can work in your favor or it can destroy you. Both the Terminator and Star Trek have suffered under the paradoxical strain of time travel. I suppose the main lure of the concept is the chance to go back and live key moments in your life and do them differently, putting right what once went wrong - the lifetime pursuit of Doctor Samuel Beckett.Back to the Future is a pop culture giant for many reasons. The iconic poster art, the fire trails, the instantly recognizable DeLorean, the title font, the costume design, the locations, Alan Silvestri's thrilling score, Huey Lewis' emblematic theme tune, but mainly for the dual time period. 1985 was present day when it was released but as I type this review it is 31 years in the past. In 1985 the western world still had a naive innocence, a hope that the future could be bright. Culture was hedonistic, optimistic, willing to experiment. In the three decades since then we have become bitter, pessimistic, and cynical. Dystopia, dysfunction, and distrust has permeated the majority of households. We are no longer a society that plans for the future, only to struggle through the day-by-day grind of increasingly hopeless existence. We long for the glory days of 1985 and Back to the Future allows us to access that dream.But there was an even more naive and innocent time, a world that Marty McFly finds himself trapped in with only a chance lightning strike to send him back home. 1955 Hill Valley (or Kingston Falls if you look at it from a Gremlins perspective) is a post-WWII Utopian Americana where the streets are clean, the world is safe, and the lifestyles are wholesome. It's a rose-tinted insight into forever gone era. Society has grown darker and darker over the decades. We all wish we had a nuclear-powered time machine to stop this ever-declining spiral and skew the timeline into an alternate present.Back to the Future is a good movie, a great movie, a perfectly cast and acted movie, an all time best and a classic for all the right reasons, but its main appeal is that it makes the viewer think ""what if I had that chance?"" I think most people would sacrifice their comfortable familiarity of their known present to go back in time and radically change the future for the better, and what better style to do that in than a DeLorean?This movie will never age. It's an icon of its era and a movie that defines an entire decade. It will stand the test of time (pun intended) and will appeal to each new generation for all of the above reasons. That's just the power of love, man."
27.01.2016,9.0,"This movie has it all. Great story line. The right actors playing the roles. And so many memorable moments. The flux capacitor idea was awesome! Doc was amazing! If you're one of the few on the planet who hasn't seen it - buy it, rent it or find an old theatre that plays the classics.I remember watching this for the first time and was amazed by how many details were in the story. My parents were young in the 1950s and have told me many times how accurate the period references were. Back To The Future will always be my favorite Michael J. Fox film. He's done many good ones, but this has that ""it"" quality. Very special!"
22.01.2016,8.0,"Back to the Future is the classic sci-fi, adventure and comedy film nearly everyone has watched and loved, it is directed and co-written by Robert Zemeckis, staring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as a troubled teen and a failed scientist who a thrust into a adventure through time in this praised trilogy.I will try be as unbiased as possible but even if I were to forget the years of loving this film and forgetting about all the joy it brought me, it's still a fantastic film. Back to the Future achieves in every aspect which is more than can be said for a lot of films.First off are the characters, perhaps the most important reason why this film is so great, each character is distinct and unique, likable and interact perfectly leading to hilarious and emotional scenes. They are all fantastically performed by a superb cast who bring these people to life more than any other actor could, you can't imagine another person playing them because they just fit so well in their roles. When you boil down this recipe and sprinkle some well written dialogue on the top you get some brilliant scenes, most of which made me (and the whole cinema) howl with laughter. Not only that but the romance intertwined with the plot is very well done, not feeling forced or poorly executed, this is coming from a guy who hates unnecessary love in films, I liked the romance! Which was very important since it makes up a huge chunk of the plot.On top of a captivating story and a set of great characters are also great visuals from its cinematography to its slightly dated effects which just add to the charm. The use of visual comedy which is very scarce now days was a nice addition. All accompanied by a stunning score by the always brilliant Alan Silvestri which is one of my favourites to this day, from the roaring orchestra to Huey Lewis and the New this is a go to soundtrack for me and goes great with the film, adding to the humour and the tension which for what many would consider a laid back lazy Sunday film, there is a lot of.Overall this is one of my favourite films of all time and has been since I first saw it many years ago and the fact that it's still up there really says something about how timeless it is. The characters, the humour, the music, everything is just spot on all combining into something that will be loved for generations to come."
15.01.2016,10.0,"""Back to the Future"" has to be one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made, including the film's movie trilogy. It was great with the movie soundtracks and the amount of comedy running through the whole thing.The movie has to be everybody's dream at some point, he starts with a family that is partially wrecked by the father's lifelong bully, alongside his friend scientist shot dead, and (by accident) fixes it all in the past. With a lot of amusing comedy moments in between, one of the classic moments was the ""I hate manure"" scenes there were in the whole trilogy.I find it rather sad that most people seem to assume that the DeLorean car in this was just a special car made for the film, because that car was actually a more efficient car made in the 80's. Kind of like 80's version of today's Toyota Prius. Too bad the movie didn't get the DeLorean more popularly bought.Oh well, ""Back to the Future"" is a great movie, and to prove this, it is still a popular movie even today."
11.01.2016,7.0,"I was definitely late to the party on this one. I missed out on watching this at anytime over the past 26 years of my life, and I also missed watching it during the anniversary event in October 2015. I believe the adage is ""better late than never"", I hope it is anyway. No matter how late I was to this film, I'm glad I watched it. Back to the Future was a wonderful tale of ingenuity, diligence, and retribution. Michael J. Fox teams up with Christopher Lloyd in a quest finish his greatest invention and freely travel the realms of time.Our story begins in 1985, as we are introduced to Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a quintessential American teenager, forever embarrassed of his parents and seeking independence. His friendship with the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is well- established as he is in tuned to the many experiments he is in the process of developing. When Doc is ready to unveil his creation, he asks Marty to meet him at the mall in the middle of the night. Shocked at Doc's explanation that he has uncovered the secret ingredient needed to power his time machine, Marty is intrigued. When a terrible accident takes place, Marty is accidentally send to November 12th, 1955 where his entire existence hangs in the balance, as he must be sure that his parents to-be meet and fall in love, in spite of the fact that his entry into the past has disrupted this. The audience accompanies Marty through a nostalgic look at life in the 50's, and all that Marty introduces to the past. Marty's trip culminates with a big finale that must spark him back to his present.No one talks about Back to the Future without mentioning the incredible on-screen chemistry between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Despite their vast differences in age, they pull off a believable well-established friendship beautifully on-screen. Several scenes throughout involve just the two of them, a type of movie in which chemistry is crucial. Another bright spot of the film is the shooting. With many special effects, especially in the climax, it needs to be believable or the story would fall apart. Robert Zemeckis obviously directs a beauty with Back to the Future and is a joy for audiences from beginning to end.A powerful message emerges as one watches Back to the Future. Many of the film's leads at one point has their character questioned. At the beginning of the film we meet George McFly (Crispin Glover), who doesn't look like he's strayed far from the 1950's even in the 80's. He is getting pushed around in the film, like he has all of his life, and seems to be destined for a life filled with this type of abuse. He seems to have no respect from his family members, or anyone else that comes into contact with him. Marty shows us, through his journey that sometime all it takes to make someone realize they deserve better is a little confidence from a friend. We also learn early on in the film that Marty has a passion for music and a dream to pursue it. He gets a big chance to realize this musical dream at his parent's dance in the past. He convinces his dad to pursue his own writing dream when he visits him in 1955, and seeing his father's dream pan out, one can only assume Marty will take his own advice in the future. One can also take a lesson from Doc Brown's perseverance throughout the film. He is never appreciated for his ingenuity, and often thought of as crazy for pursuing his scientific endeavors. In spite of all this criticism, Doc presses on and remains steadfast in his scientific exploits. There is something in this film for everyone, and the audience is given enough tools to find whatever suits them.Now that I have finally seen Back to the Future, I can understand why it has remained such a staple for decades after its release. This story provides a feel good story of normal, good people overcoming the evils of other normal people. Not an overwhelming moral story to the point where it is cheesy and unbelievable, but one that tugs at this reviewer's heartstrings nonetheless. Back to the Future is a four star prize for me, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes to follow an engaging story with fun characters. One does not even have to be a fan of time travel movies, as I am not, to enjoy this film. I'm glad I finally gave this movie a chance, and I will probably be along for the whole series."
22.12.2015,10.0,"Back to the Future is one of those movies with everlasting appeal that everybody loves to watch. Who would have thought when this was released 30 years ago back in 1985 that it would forever remain etched in everyone's memories and in movie history as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time. With its cleverly intelligent story and the perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, adventure, and romance, director Robert Zemeckis struck gold with this one of a kind movie that can never be duplicated. It also goes without saying that nobody can go past Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown. Mention any of those actors and without a doubt Back to the Future will always pop up as one of their most memorable movies.Back to the Future takes place in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an aspiring musician who is dating Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and lives with his dysfunctional family. His weak willed father George McFly (Crispin Glover) is bullied mercilessly by his boss Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and his mother Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) is an unhappy alcoholic. While she disapproves of Marty's relationship with Jennifer, Lorraine recounts how she met George when her father hit him with his car. On 26 October 1985, Marty meets his friend the eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in one of his most memorable roles) at a shopping mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. When the Libyan terrorists track down Doc Brown, Marty manages to escape however inadvertently finds himself transported back to 5 November 1955. Marty finds himself in a time where his parents George and Lorraine are teenagers and are yet to meet, Biff is still a bully, and Doc Brown is still developing the very early stages of a time displacement machine but is still the same eccentric scientist only 30 years younger. Not only must Marty find a way back to 1985, but he must also not tamper with history otherwise he may never be born.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are tailor made for their respective roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown. Both of them will forever be remembered for this movie. They are just fantastic! Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have put in a lot of attention to detail with the comparisons between 1985 and 1955 as well as how the timeline may be affected for the McFly family and Hill Valley. With its quirky take on the time travel genre, the whole thing is cleverly written. The special effects for its era are top notch and Alan Silvestri's score is very memorable. Huey Lewis' theme song for the movie The Power of Love fits perfectly with the movie.I could go on forever how Back to the Future is one of the best movies of all time. What more can I say? 30 years on Back to the Future has not lost its timeless appeal and audiences everywhere get a thrill out of watching the movie. Even whenever people approach Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd the main topic of conversation will always relate to Back to the Future. Followed by two clever sequels, Back to the Future will still remain a timeless classic.A well deserved 10/10."
21.12.2015,10.0,"This is my favorite movie. I like two main characters' funny conversations as well as the story itself. It has been 30 years since this masterpiece was made. There is a skateboard which can fly, and they go to this year ""2015"" in the movie.Today we can't still go to the future or past, but someone has invented the skate board.The movie made us have our big dreams! I like feeling thrilled by watching this movie, so I will definitely watch this again and again, and I think this movie is going to be watched by more people in the world."
25.11.2015,10.0,"Everyone needs to know that this program favorite includes sequences that place the hero and his friends in physical jeopardy: a gunfight in which a sympathetic character is thought to be killed, a van chasing a teen on a skateboard, several episodes of bullying, and more. The violence is exaggerated and closer in tone to cartoon jeopardy than real danger, but some kids will no doubt find it tense. Several scenes show the hero's discomfort when the girl who will eventually be his mother tries to entice him with kisses and embraces; there's also implied unwanted sex, but nothing serious happens. Strong language is included but nothing parents cant get teach their kids that its wrong. Amazing show and you would not regret watching it. Might even end up like m e watching it over and over again."
23.11.2015,10.0,"Back To The Future is one greatest films ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,an amazing score and soundtrack,a fantastic script and great special effects.

I don't think director Robert Zemeckis or the cast knew what they had was something that was special,magical and timeless and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and will continue to be enjoyed by past,present and future generations. The movie is also the first feature of one of the most beloved movie trilogies of all-time and while all three Back To The Future films are classics as a whole the first is still the best. What Back To The Future does so well is that it takes the time travel movie and gives it style and creativity mixing together different movie genres Comedy,SCI-FI,Action,Romance and thrills giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink but the movie never becomes uneven or confusing making Back To The Future one of the best genre mash-up movies I have ever seen.

The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is incredible and quotable with tons memorable scenes and dialog that are funny done with perfection and fun as well with ingenious style and rapid fire delivery that is wonderful. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF are hilarious and fun with moments that are over the top and great thanks to the actions and reactions of Marty and Doc Brown and the main characters. The SCI-FI scenes in BTTF involving the Delorean are so dazzling and are done with imagination and beauty that will make your jaw drop and it doesn't matter how many times you see BTTF you will be blown away by the Delorean sequences. There have been many classic movie duos throughout cinema and among the great duos are Marty and Doc. The scenes between Marty and Doc are truly funny with terrific back and forth banter and have some of the best scenes in the film that are unforgettable. While the two are different in personality and are separated by age the two have a friendship that feels genuine and real where you feel that Marty and Doc would have each other's back at all costs. The friendship between Marty and Doc is further cemented in Part II and III where you feel they will be friends forever whether it's in the future or in the present. Marty and Doc are two amazing and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. The ending of Back To The Future is terrific,thrilling and filled with surprises that will leave viewers laughing and smiling. A fantastic ending.The cast is wonderful. Michael J.

22.11.2015,10.0,"""Where were going we don't need roads"". Back to the Future is full of 80s nostalgia, and is surely one of the most entertaining films of all time. Between the rocking soundtrack to the retro fashion(the life preserver!) Back to the Future is jam packed with everything 80s. The story follows a young teenager living in 1985, Marty McFly, who, accidentally is teleported back to 1955, using a Time Machine out of a Delorean. The most is extremely entertaining, and whether you enjoy the humour, the Sci Fi or both, you are sure to be entertained either way.Roberts Zemeckis direction helps the film reach fullest velocity. His script, which he also wrote, is very original and creative. Just Imagine if Back to the Future was never made, it's almost impossible to think about. The film is great entertainment for young and old, and sure will be a memory in your mind forever."
22.11.2015,9.0,"When Marty travels back in time to 1955, he accidentally ruins the moment his parents would have met, threatening his own existence. With the help of the younger version of the scientist who built the time machine back in 1985, Marty has to find a way to get his parents back together as well as trying to find a way back home to 1985. The movie is brilliant from start to finish and reminds of that other comedy classic Groundhog Day. Both movies are superbly well written and directed as well as sporting a near perfect cast. Even after 30 years, Back to the Future is a joy to watch with truly iconic performances by Christopher Lloyd, Michael J. Fox, Thomas F. Wilson and Crispin Glover. 9/10"
21.11.2015,10.0,"It has been thirty years since this movie came out, and has now become a household name as everyone around the world makes references from each scene they reenact, quote lines from each character they say and make parodies out of it. ""Back to the Future"" is one of my favorite movies, and it is one of the best if not the best about time travel. There have been plenty of movies about time travel, but when it comes to time travel movies I think of this one. So with said, the movie is about Marty McFly who accidentally goes back in time to 1955 as he alters history by saving his father from getting hit by a car, and his mother for falling in love as well as his existence. So Marty has to put it all back as how things should be, while Doc Brown tries to get Marty back home to 1985. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do work well together like bread and butter. Lea Thompson looks lovely and she really plays her role really well. The rest of the cast all did great. The movie itself is really funny, and it is also exciting too. The movie doesn't feature that many special effects by ILM, but I love the effects for the car traveling through time just as what it appears in the movie without any time travel sequence like having a portal or something. The design of the DeLorean for being used as a time travel vehicle is really iconic, and loved the way how it looks. The music by Alan Silvestri is so unforgettable, and loved hearing the theme that he created. The movie is very well scripted, and I thought Robert Zemeckis does a really good job on directing this movie after making another movie that is also good ""Romancing the Stone."" The production design for the 1955 scenes are outstanding, and I thought the pacing of the movie is top-notch. I really hope Hollywood doesn't try to remake this or the sequels, because they're fine for what they are; just like what everyone says ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I have nothing against remakes, but sometimes it just gets lazy for Hollywood to try to come up with some new stories, and new ideas for what movie is there to make. So please, for one last time as I say this ""DON""T REMAKE THIS MOVIE OR THE SEQUELS!"" Now I got that out of my way, so now I need to wraps things up with this review, ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a classic movie, and really can't say no more about it. I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
20.11.2015,10.0,"It's a teenage movie, it's a comedy, it's a science fiction adventure... and there's nothing better.Back to the Future is a smart inventive all-time masterpiece and I have never known any other movie that I have seen that I have watched over and over again and again, that's how much I love this movie. The cast and their chemistry on screen are unforgettable: Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is an energetic teenager with a passion for music and someone who does not want you to call ""chicken"".Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown is a scientist who wants to invent something unique that works and to change the world. With his new invention of time travel that he made out of a DeLorean. Christopher Lloyd's performance was not nominated for an Oscar because his performance was the most fascinating part of the movie and one of the most interesting performances in a movie that I've seen in a long while. More praise goes to Chrispin Glover's performance as George McFly. He was my favourite part of the movie, especially the two scenes where he tries to woo Lorraine Baines and says ""I'm your density"" one of my favourite movie quotes. The moment in the film (SPOILERS just in case you haven't seen it yet) where he stands up to Biff surprised me and showed me that he could stand up for himself and the woman he loves. Lea Thompson was fantastic as well as Lorraine Baines.Back to the Future was something that surprised me because I never knew now how much I would love it. I don't know if I've ever felt this good about a movie in a long time since I first watched Jaws or Whiplash.10/10"
13.11.2015,10.0,"This film is most definitely a classic, one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made. Prepare yourself to take the biggest adventure Back to the Future when you watch this film. I think this film will always be known as one of the big movie classics for years to come. I wasn't born when this film was first brought out in the cinemas but I remember from an early age watching this with my family and being completely awestruck by how great this movie was. I remember it made me want to go and build my own time- machine (sniggers) and head back to certain times in history, as well as speeding forward into the future to see what my future self would be like. Well, if there's one thing that is guaranteed, throughout my future from my early age, I have always been a massive fan of this film."
05.11.2015,,"In this movie the basic plot is that the Doc and Marty get stuck in 1955 i'd recommend it for all ages The nostalgia factor is really high on this one even if you have not seen it when it first came out in 1985 you can get a bluray copy witch i first saw this movie in 2013 and i loved everything about it, it is and old movie that still holds up well to this day i recommend it to everyone it is like star wars only less nerdy.Also another thing to point out in this movie is the cast i mean Christopher Loyd and Michael J fox they do an amazing job it is a shame they can not do another movie together but hey life is not fair enjoy this film :D"
05.11.2015,10.0,"Behold Robert Zemeckis' masterpiece, one of the best films ever to come out of the 1980s. One of the most brilliant and creative films I've ever seen, Back to the Future is an enduring classic.The star of the show is Marty McFly, played with utter brilliance by Michael J. Fox. Marty is a bit of a cool kid, but as played by Fox he's also a bit of a goof and he's hilarious to watch. In my opinion, McFly is the greatest movie protagonist of all time. He rattles off the incredible dialogue from Zemeckis and Bob Gale but also injects it with such authentic emphasis and ""ums"" and ""ahs"" that its so easy to watch without thinking that you are watching a performance. He has incredible chemistry with Doc Brown (the unparalleled Christopher Lloyd). Also making up the superb cast are Lea Thompson as Marty's mother, Crispin Glover as his father and Thomas F. Wilson as Biff (one of the greatest film bullies of all time, thanks to Wilson's intimidating yet incredibly funny performance).Alan Silvestri's iconic score is perfectly utilised to create a sense of triumph at key moments in the film. Zemeckis directs the hell out of the film with some superb long takes and superbly choreographed scenes. The film's climax is one of the most tense and brilliant scenes Zemeckis has ever made. But its the screenplay that makes the masterpiece - chock full of quotable dialogue, memorable characters and one of the most accessible time travel stories of all time. The story of Marty's parents is so much better now than I've ever realised; Lorraine's sheltered upbringing and George's timid persona set them up perfectly - their love story before Marty arrives is just as believable as their story as set by Marty, AND its just the right set of circumstances for his arrival to set it in jeopardy. It could have gone any way. Zemeckis and Gale place well written scenes in two different time periods to make a point more flawlessly than any amount of exposition ever could. There are some problems with the film - after George's triumphant victory in the car park, the film needs to put in one more obstacle for him to overcome (a red haired brat who is never seen before or after) which just feels like borrowing time (which was needed but could have been done better). But all you need to do is watch Michael J. Fox shred the guitar to Johnny Be Good and you'll be giving out a perfect rating just like I did."
04.11.2015,10.0,"I recently celebrated October 21, 2015 by re-watching the Back to the Future trilogy. And they were amazing. I had quite honestly forgotten just how good they were, just how funny, innovative, crazy, fast and quotable. And this is the one that started it all, and is easily the best film in the whole trilogy, which is saying a lot, keeping in mind the utter amount of quality all of them have.We all know the story. Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time machine, and wants his young friend Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to act as a witness for the first trial run. But things don't go as planned - do they ever - and Marty is flung back into the past where he has to figure out how he can get, you guessed it, back to the future. Great, amazing basic story, but what really makes this one of the most iconic time travel films ever made is the amount of detail they put into the world and the characters. The very first scene, for example, of Marty stepping into Doc's house looking for him is filled with vast amounts of little touches that all tell a story, both about Doc and Marty.And the movie just keeps going. All of the characters are very memorable and just the right amount of over the top and exaggerated. From Marty's ultimate wimp of a father George (Crispin Glover) to Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), who's such a massive Hollywood bully that it's a wonder he hasn't spontaneously combusted from sheer stereotypicality. But all that's part of the fun and the characters are played so well and the movie is so light in tone that their over the topness actually works for the film's advantage.The score by Alan Silvestri is also fantastic, one of the most iconic movie soundtracks in cinema history. Whenever the main theme blasts from the screen you're flung straight into an adventure. The special effects are also surprisingly decent. Sure there are some obvious computer effects, but they were very good for their time and luckily the film relies mostly on practical effects.Saying anything more would frankly spoil the movie too much. But trust me when I say that this is one of the finest adventure films ever made. It's cinema enjoyment distilled into its purest form. It's a sin I hadn't seen it in such a long time. A mistake which shall not be made again."
02.11.2015,5.0,"Interesting film but how are there many references to 911 in ""BACK TO THE FUTURE"" made in 1985. The numbers 911 come up repeatedly. Reference tin high explosives on Graffiti on college wall. A newspaper reports sale and re-development of an estate. Silverstein bought WTC towers just before 911 and built the Freedom tower. Middle eastern terrorists are referenced. Three plutonium bombs are referenced. Three nuclear bombs brought down 3 towers on ground zero ( the point on the ground at which a nuclear bomb is exploded). A tower with a MEMORIAL in front is referenced. The Deloren is mistaken for a plane and Marti mistaken for an alien. The pentagon is referenced by Doc's mind control device. The twin tree mall becomes a single Tree mall. A black politician is stated. There is a shop front with the all seeing eye of the illuminati sign. Politician integrity is referenced. At the end of the film the tracks of the Deloren makes the 911 image. Marti Films Doc as was 911 filmed.The same director Zemeckis has now directed The Walk. This is referenced where Marti was going to Oct 2015 in Back to the future 1."
01.11.2015,9.0,"I suppose like many people I got caught up in the whole ""it was 30 years ago today"" shtick surrounding this movie of late and with a free Saturday afternoon indoors, with my wife watched this movie neither of us had seen since 1985. Thankfully, we both found it was just as much fun and exciting to see as all those years ago. I mean I'm an absolute sucker for any kind of time-travel stuff, especially the whole circular time, going-back-to-your-own-past-changing-your-own-future thing. I love how the film sometimes subtly, sometimes obviously sets up the prompts for future resolution, by so often doubling back on itself, but of course never lets all that timey-wimey stuff get in the way of what is at heart a rollicking, exciting, family entertainment.It helps that the casting is so good, Michael J Fox as the spirited, energetic teenager Marty McFly and the great Christopher Lloyd as the madcap scientist Doc Brown in the two lead roles but also the characters of Marty's gormless mum and dad and numb-skull bully Biff. The period-settings are lovingly and nostalgically rendered and the humour is sharp and relevant, as Marty straightens out the future lives of his whole family, actually saves the lives of his brother, sister and Doc while inventing rock and roll in the process!This really is a timeless entertainment and what better adjective could I use to describe it than that."
24.10.2015,10.0,"I have seen this movie literally over 300 times and it never gets old! I have high hopes that a 4th movie might make it's way to a theater near you soon! Great Scott Marty! The Doc was such a huge inspiration to me as a child and made me believe that anything is possible! I went to college and became a Mechanical Engineer because this movie made such a big impact on my life. One of my bucket list goals is to own a Delorean one day and cruise the interstate going 88 mph, without getting a speeding ticket lol! It would be so cool if all the original actors got together to do spoof or even better, be in the 4th movie! I am not sure if an all new cast could do this story line justice or not but I'm willing to entertain the possibilities as long as it does not displace the time-space continuum!"
23.10.2015,10.0,"This fusion of sci-fi, action, romance and comedy could have been a dreadful mess, were it not for writer-director Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale's refusal to let a loose line or idea escape their pens. The funnies come thick and fast – Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as ""a rhythmic ceremonial ritual""; Marty's hapless dad (the incomparable Crispin Glover) tremblingly telling his ma ""I'm your density..."" – but more satisfying still is the intricate interplay between past and future. It turns out that Marty's Uncle ""Jailbird"" Joey loves, as an infant, to stay in his cot (""Better get used to these bars, kid""). The young Doc's incredulity on hearing of actor Ronald Reagan's next job – ""Who's Vice-President? Jerry Lewis?"" – spoke for the world, and Marty's means of returning to 1985 is a stroke of narrative genius. Scheduling clashes very nearly led to Marty's being played by Eric Stoltz, but (with all respect to the very capable Stoltz) thank heavens a solution was found, as the film would have been immeasurably the poorer without Fox's uniquely energetic charm. It's particularly cruel that so physically nimble a performer should since have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, but he continues to approach it with a hero's grace and humour, and has become a major figure in increasing awareness for the disease."
23.10.2015,8.0,"""Back to the Future"" is one of those films every 80's/90's kid just has to see! It's such a fun, light-hearted typical 80's flick. I wouldn't classify it as a comedy, because it won't have you on the floor rolling. It's more of a really light adventure film that has a simple, clean plot that doesn't claim to be anything more than what it is.Marty McFly is your typical, trouble-making 80's teenager, who grows up in a troubled household. His father doesn't know how to stand up for himself and doesn't live up to his full potential due to an intense fear of rejection. His mother is obviously dissatisfied with her life and is an alcoholic. His older brother has a dead end job. And Marty has the same fear of rejection his father does. Except Marty is more adventurous, and his uncanny friendship with a mad scientist leads him to travel back in time 30 years, to the time when his parents met. Due to some unlucky mishaps, the younger version of his mother ends up falling in love with Marty instead of his father. Marty must race against the clock to correct history and get his parents to fall in love, and ultimately to return...back to the future.This is such a cult classic. It is literally ""timeless"", and is a must-see for any generation. Michael J Fox is perfect in his innocent, boy-hood portrayal of Marty McFly. If they ever do a remake of this movie, I will be sorely disappointed because nothing can ever replace the original."
22.10.2015,10.0,"Ah, distinctly I remember, it was my grandfather (may he rest in peace) who first showed this film to me, on video when I was a very small child. It was him and his second wife, and two of their friends, and me, and distinctly I also remember vividly immediately after the film was over, I said, ""I want to watch it again!"" 30 years after its initial release, this is still a hilarious, wonderfully wacky sci-fi/ comedy/ romance/ action flick, and one of the very few films which even attempts to cover all of those bases, and does so extremely well, as it sends a 17 years old 30 years into the past in a DeLorean built by a nutjob inventor, Doc Emmet L. Brown, brilliantly played by Christopher Lloyd. An over-the-top satire of mad scientists, when he shouts, ""It works!"", it reminded me of Dr. Frankenstein shouting ""It's alive!"", upon seeing his creation. Even the film's ending still had suspense, I was still on the edge of my seat (as the cliché goes) when Doc was on the edge of the clocktower, lightning bolts crashing and crackling, again similar to film Frankenstein's creation of the monster. There is also a sad, tragic feel to a few scenes, as Marty fears for his friend's life. As Biff, Thomas Wilson is hysterical also, the kind of over-sized nitwit most of us knew in high school, who we waited to see get their comeuppance. A childish baby, stuck in a large man's body. Some well selected and timed oldies, and original score was perfect, not a single note misused, nor was there a single line of dialogue misused, out of place, or unnecessary. The same can be said about the cinematography, which includes several of Dean Cundey's long takes (opening shot in the Doc's garage, and the unveiling of the DeLorean. One of my all time favourites, 10/ 10, easily. Upon seeing it again in the cinema yesterday (21 October 2015, Back To The Future day) me and the entire audience were in stitches all throughout, and the film actually received a standing ovation when it finished."
21.10.2015,10.0,"Today was the day me and my best friend from high school-who now works at the movie theatre that is showing these Back to the Future trilogies-saw these again, a little more than 30 years after this first one initially came out. Because the second one took place partially on October 21, 2015 was the reason for this series playing for that one day. Anyway, this first one was the best of them mainly because of the contrast between teen Marty McFly's '80s lifestyle and that of his parents' when they were teens in the '50s. Also, his relationship with Doc Brown was also a big part of the movie's phenomenal success. That and plenty of jokes about culture shock and great chase scenes. My favorite scene involved Marty playing heavy metal licks at the '50s dance sequence. And what great players like Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd handling their roles the way they do! And, yes, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson are also fine as Marty's parents and his father's bully, respectively. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale fashioned a fine screenplay with excellent direction from Zemeckis. This is still my favorite '80s movie, bar none! So on that note, I definitely highly recommend Back to the Future. P.S. One of the most interesting things I now know about this movie is that the younger brother of Lorraine in the '50s sequence was played by Jason Hervey who was also in the other summer blockbuster of the summer of '85-Pee Wee's Big Adventure-and would later play Kevin Arnold's older brother, Wayne, on ""The Wonder Years""."
21.10.2015,9.0,"Back To The Future is one my favorite summer movies, it has everything a summer movie needs, comedy, suspense, a bit of action, and an eccentric old professor. And since today was the day that the future was predicted to be in (by the way I'm not reviewing Part 2, because I don't like it), I decided today would be the best day to review this movie.One aspect that I like about this movie is the contrast between the two different decades. For instance, when the movie begins we see the 80s where people wear strange looking clothes and Huey Lewis songs always play, then it cuts to the past with incredibly basic looking houses and cars and even the songs are different. That's kinda the reason I give this movie a pass with some of the cheesy 80s aspects, since it help differentiate the two different decades.Another thing I love about this movie is the way the story feels like it would be in a cheesy 50s or 60s comic, except it takes place in the 1980s. The tone of the film is almost always adventurous and fun, like what summer should be like: adventurous and fun.Also the movie has many iconic aspects, the Delorean, Doc Brown, the weird Rube Goldberg machine at the beginning and so many other little things.Anyways, Back To The Future is a movie I think everyone should see in their lifetime, not because it is emotionally powerful or philosophical, but because it a quintessential summer movie.Final Score: 9/10"
21.10.2015,9.0,My favorite time travel trilogy as a teenager. I remember watching this on home video back in 1988 and I loved it. My father and I later returned it to the video store and asked the owner if there were more sequels planned. He said probably never. To our surprise the following year Universal Studios announced two sequels. There was a big ad banner with Michael J. Fox during the tour of the Studios.There are so many wonderful memories captured in this film. It is absolutely amazing that 30 years have passed since it was first shown in theaters. This one along with the Time Machine (1960) are the best movies ever made about time travel.The future is what you make of it.
20.10.2015,7.0,"Let's start off with a statement: This film is a classic masterpiece.The writing, the characters, the dialog, the technology- it's all epic. Steven Spielberg has always been an outstanding director.This film, no matter what year is it right now, will still be a massive classic masterpiece. Everything is done correctly is this film, nothing went wrong, there wasn't a single moment when you actually feel bored, and when a film makes you feel the same as it did when it was first released in theaters- that's an marvelous achievement for a movie. I'm definitely planning on watching this trilogy a couple more times in the future (pun intended).Overall, this is one of those movies that you just have to watch at least once before you die."
20.10.2015,10.0,"If you are reading this, it more than likely means you still haven't seen bttf, but you are thinking about watching it. If that is the case, you need this movie in your life.I first watched this movie when I was about 8 years old, and have loved the trilogy ever since. But this, the first of the 3, is arguably the best.I would say it's suitable for the entire family, but be warned, there is one or 2 minor profanities if you are watching it on DVD/Bluray, but if you are watching it on TV, these will have been neatly removed from the movie for you ;-) It's got an awesome soundtrack, it's funny, it holds your attention and has awesome gadgets and props, the big one being the time travelling Delorean, and a timeless fun story line.Marty (Michael J Fox) goes back in time and has to find a younger Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in the past to help him get Back to the Future before he potentially changes things in his present (1985).This movie has lived on to be a timeless classic and remains one of my favourite movies of all time.Trust me, you won't be disappointed and will be itching to watch the next 2 instalments as soon as your done with this one."
20.10.2015,10.0,"Back to the future — it is a movie made by Robert Zemeckis, which gave rise to one of the most iconic franchises in cinematography about time traveling teenager Marty McFly and his friend and inventor Emmett Brown. Impossible to pick one thing, what exactly I like, because of the advantages this film has. In General, the plot of this film is laid out very good , in the most minute detail. The cast is really great: Christopher Lloyd gave us the image of the eccentric, but undeniably brilliant Doctor Brown, Michael Fox who played the character Marty McFly, Lea Thompson, who played 17-year- old girl and her 30 years later. Crispin Glover - all of his roles completely different from each other, even in ""Back to the future"" — there was one person, but he was reincarnated three times. So, the film ""Back to the future"" — one of the best representatives of its genre, wonderful exciting fantastic comedy that in many ways defined the further development of the genre. As for me, this film is really great."
11.10.2015,10.0,Back to the Future is a perfect time travel movie. Marty McFly is a normal boy in 1985. He goes to school and has a girlfriend. But one of his friends is a doctor calls Doc Brown. Doc Brown is the reason why Marty he is in the past. Enough about the story because I do not want to spoiler something. The characters are very sympathetic and it is funny to watch to them. The film make me happy when I look him. The atmosphere of the film is perfect and about the complete movie you have fun. Also the story of the movie is brilliant and very good wrote. When you search a movie with you can have fun and it is exciting Back to the Future is perfect for you. You can look the movie more than one time and have fun like you watch the movie first time. You see there are only positive points about the movie and it is very difficult to find a negative point. In this movie you can see the talent of Michael Fox and it is very sad what is happen with him. But with this movie he always remains in my memory. In my opinion Back to the Future is one of the best movies of all time and a modern classic.
23.09.2015,10.0,"I got this movie for Easter from my parents and I was pretty excited about seeing this movie. When I saw the movie, I knew immediately that it had Michael J. Fox in it, which is one of my favorite actors of all time! I liked the time travel scenes when he went to 88 mph. I liked also the speed of the movie, where it went at my pace. It's so awesome, and if you haven't seen this, I HIGHLY recommend you guys seeing this movie!!! Also, when I was watching the Peeping Tom scene, my heart just went into laughter!!! If I had the chance to watch this movie again, I sure would! By the way, when I was watching the end, I thought there wasn't going to be a second movie, and it all ended there. But, I looked Back to the Future up on Amazon, and there was a part 2 and a part 3. I thought, ""Yay! There's two other Back to the Future movies! Maybe I can watch them!"" I got them for Christmas last year, and I've enjoyed both of them! Your Future is Whatever you Make it!"" -Doc Brown Fritz Siegel"

16.09.2015,,"Had to have been one of the greatest films I have witnessed. Watching this when I was younger had such a great impact on my life growing up. By far, this is the best movie to ever cover time travel, and maintain a realistic path. I encourage any movie goer to first watch this film before any that bend the time barrier. Some of Michael J Foxx and Christopher LLoyd's best work. This is when Universal Studios and Sony realized that there was something to control in order to move the people and they ran with it. This film is one of my top 10 to watch and re-watch. Timeless and for the ages will forever be watched/remembered. I will be sure to show this film to my children. If they do not witness this movie, they may never know what it feels like to travel through time and still connect to the present. I thank producers for making movies as such. These days, movies do not hold the same honesty, innocence, or writing as a movie like this one. Big ups to writing and casting staff."
14.09.2015,8.0,"Back to the Future (1985), an eighties classic, is already celebrating its thirtieth birthday this year which makes it the perfect opportunity to review this 'popcornflick'. Back to the Future was written (together with Bob Gale) and directed by the now famous Robert Zemeckis. Together with Spielberg they proved that eighties films could have cheese all over it while still being a whole lotta fun. Assisted by a top-notch cast in the likes of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, Back to the Future became the quintessential 1980s flick that inventively combined a funny script, with action, science fiction and romance, that brings joy to both children and well... big children. It's present time, or at least it was in 1985, and we are introduced to the teenager Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, who lives together with his rather nerdy parents. Though his household sometimes feels like a funhouse, Marty tries to escape from his boring life through his friendship with the eccentric Dr. Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. Dr. Brown appears to be some sort of inventor and can only be described as the lovechild of Einstein and Stokowski. With the time-traveling DeLorean created by Dr. Brown, Marty is send back in time to make sure his parents will still fall in love... again and to stop his own existence from being endangered. Back to the Future plays with the fact that teenagers believe their parents were never teenagers. How could Marty's parents have ever been teenagers if they don't understand their own son? Luckily Dr. Brown has the perfect solution and Marty travels back in time to meet his 'teenage' parents. Without spoiling the plot in detail it's quite the encounter. Let it be faith or luck, it seemed almost as if Michael J. Fox wouldn't become synonymous with his role of Marty McFly. Due scheduling clashes it was nearly a certainty that Eric Stoltz would play the now famous part. Although Stoltz is very capable in his own respect it's a blessing they found a solution to Fox's busy schedule. Michael j. Fox plays Marty with an unique and energetic charm for which he is known and it works brilliantly. In addition, the chemistry Fox and Lloyd share on screen is one of a kind, their friendship feels so natural that it is a true pleasure to withhold. This friendship is indeed one of the reasons why Back to the Future works so well and still holds up to its time. But even more importantly for its success, is the way in which the film has fun with the paradoxes and difficulties of a kid meeting his own parents. And if this alone wasn't enough we are faced with many running gags of the changes that happened in 30 years.In 1985 Spielberg gave us besides Back to the Future two other productions: ""The Goonies"" and ""Explorers"". It leaves us wonder if Spielberg, at the peak of his science fiction/adventure heyday, tried to imitate the great studio executives of Golden Hollywood, who were known for matching the right director to the right film. Robert Zemeckis and Back to the Future proved to be a match made in heaven. His big breakthrough is the perfect blend of everything cinema stands for. It's made with such an unforgettable spirit you only wish they made more like these today. Too much nostalgia? Oh well..."
05.09.2015,8.0,"Besides Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure Back To The Future is my second favorite time traveling comedy because it's loaded with great special effects, awesome tunes including Huey Lewis's Power Of Love and a entertaining story.Michael J. Fox is funny & talented having seen him perform on television and in film, his character Marty McFly is a typical 1980's teenager whose about to go on the most unexpected journey of his life. Other cast members include Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, Wendie Jo Sperber, Thomas F. Wilson, Claudia Wells, Marc McClure, James Tolkan, Billy Zane and Christopher Lloyd as scientist & inventor Emmett Brown.Back To The Future tells the tale of a 17 year old boy who gets transported back to the 50's via a time machine, he meets his teen aged parents and must somehow get them to fall in love or else the existence of him and his siblings will be in jeopardy. What follows is a hysterically, scientific adventure as Marty must enlist the help of 1955 Doc (Lloyd) in order to return home to 1985.This 80's treasure has become one of my favorites due to the hilarious fun and memorable lines."
04.09.2015,10.0,"One of the most iconic movies in cinematic history, where, in 1985, young Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels back to 1955 in a time machine (named the DeLorean) invented by his scientist friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). In meets his high-school-age parents and inadvertently disrupts their first meeting; therefore, he must unite them in order to save their eventual courtship and marriage, and ultimately, Marty's own existence.Despite being an '80s film, the special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean.The direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film engaging throughout, from Marty traveling back in time to save Emmett Brown to him meeting his future family. Seeing the transformation from the characters in present time to the past with Marty trying to patch things up in the past for a better future outcome are things that make time travel films brilliant. I also especially liked the dialog from the 1955 time-line, ""He's teasing you, nobody has two television sets!"" Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson. They all made the film fun and entertaining. As a time travel film, this plot really has a race against time element that makes this movie that much more exciting and an edge-of-your-seat experience. A must-see for sci-fi fans! Grade A"
31.08.2015,10.0,"This may not be the best movie of the eighties. But it is the movie that I deem to best represent the cinema and spirit of the decade. If you're wondering, that movie for the fifties is Rebel Without a Cause. For the sixties, it's Planet of the Apes. For the seventies, it's Apocalypse Now. For the nineties, it's the Truman Show. For the 2000s, it's The Dark Knight. For the 2010s, it's... I don't know. The Social Network? Anyways; let's dive in to this film, possibly my favorite true action-comedy of all time. If I want to be entertained for two hours, this is the film I'll pop in. There are two kinds of excellence in film; the kind that appeals to what 'normal people' want in movies and the kind that appeals to those who deal probably deal far too much in the esoteric. While I firmly belong in the second group, I am a film-goer, and as such, I do enjoy the first kind. And no film offers more of the first kind than this one.The comedy, the action, the tone, the stylings; they're all here. It does not try to be a big, emotional artsy movie. Instead, it just takes you for an enjoyable ride. The eighties did this kind of movie better than any decade. When you think of eighties movies, you likely think of these movies. This is the best one, but the likes of The Goonies, Ghostbusters, Gremlins, and likely any other movie in this decade with the involvement of Steven Spielberg comes to mind.Not to say that the eighties didn't try to make serious movies too. they just weren't very good at it. If you're interested, look up a list of Best Picture winners. Watching them is a bit weird; they have some eighties stylings but are dead grim and often depressing. It's like watching a film from a different dimension. Some were fine (Terms of Endearment) some were not as good (Out of Africa).I like the lot of them as a whole better than most. And the ones that people really like (Amadeus, Platoon, etc) that people love, I likely love more. But I will admit that they aren't exactly foremost on most people's eyes. There's a reason that there aren't talks to remake Driving Miss Daisy. And it's not because it's artistic blasphemy. They would remake The Godfather if they thought that it would make them money.Here's a novel idea: how about I actually discuss Back to the Future? A high school kid named Marty McFly, down in the dumps from his high school life, where he is bullied by Biff Tannen and is under the control of the aptly named Principal Strickland (strangely, growing up, I had an insurance agent with that last name around by neighborhood. It was weird.) His home life isn't much better: his dad is a wimp, his mom is prudish enough to make one shrivel up, and his siblings are layabouts. But his life changes once his friend Doc Brown makes a time machine (2015 here. still waiting for one). As he stole plutonium form Libyan militants, they chase and kill him. While escaping in a DeLorean, Marty transports them back to 1955.Thus begins the best use of nostalgia for the fifties in an eighties movie I've ever seen. Their cleverness in weaving in it is matched only by what they do with their setting. Where as a lesser movie would just throw up scenery and call it a day, this film uses every opportunity to use its setting for purposes both comedic and dramatic.Whereas films like Dirty Dancing couldn't even immerse their film completely in one decade (if you're gonna be a fifties movie, don't use an eighties soundtrack), this movie somehow manages to immerse you in two decades. Their version of the fifties is solid and fully fleshed out. It does not use pandering or too many rosey tones but still manages to capture the sensation of time traveling there.All this is only likely noticed on a third viewing. The first time, you are too immersed in the perfect blend of action and comedy, a trademark of Zemeckis at his best, from Forrest Gump to Who Framed (not Killed, no matter what my brain thinks) Roger Rabbit, as well as in the tight writing. The second time, you are two invested in the characters and one of the best and catchiest soundtracks of the decade. But if you watch this movie as much as I do, you notice that it is there.What else is there to say? there is a reason that I have such a personal attachment to this film. The only bad thing is that we don't have a time machine that would allow this film to be watched an infinite amount of times without any real time passing. But maybe someday. After all, where we're going, we don't need roads."
26.08.2015,9.0,"Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a typical teenager growing up in the 80s. He hopes to make a man out of his milquetoast father, the middle-aged George McFly (a deliciously funny sad sack as played by 20-year-old Crispin Glover) who is still groveling at the feet of his former high school classmate, a perpetual bully named Biff. Marty's prim mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) appears to be drowning her frustrations in vodka. The movie does not really catch fire until, when testing out a souped-up DeLorean as a time machine with his eccentric, wide-eyed, wild-haired stork of a mad scientist friend Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (played by the hilariously frazzled Christopher Lloyd), Marty is whisked back to 1955. Here, he comes face to face with his nerdy teenage dad and also his unrecognizably gorgeous mom. After inadvertently causing his own mother to become infatuated with him – who finds him an absolute dreamboat, it is left up to Marty to repair the course of time and ensure that she falls in love with his future father, George or face being erased out of existence altogether. To do so, he gets in touch with a young Doc, who is as much a fish out of water in the past as he is in the present, and persuades him to send him back to 1985. Can he put things right and return to the future before it's too late?Director Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future represents that rare perfect matrimony of everything a film needs to succeed, from the adroit direction, the immaculately styled performances and the scintillating visual effects that never swamp the film. The constituent elements would not operate without the film's biggest triumph – its screenplay – which is among the most economic and brilliantly composed, for there are no disposable lines of dialogue; everything spoken is either cuttingly funny and heartfelt (check Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as ""a rhythmic ceremonial ritual""), or employed to foreshadow a temporal event later in the film.Anchoring it all is Fox's stumbling charm. The boyishly good-looking Fox is charming as the lead, exuding cocksure – yet never arrogant – buoyancy. Lloyd, meanwhile, nails his Einstein-on-acid role perfectly, never venturing too far into caricature, yet spinning the archetypal mad scientist role with a wink and a nod, making it unquestionably his signature performance. Together, they make an idiosyncratic couple, for sure, but a perfect one at that.In Back to the Future, there is an effervescence to the filmmaking, a bubbling, giddy effortlessness that's almost addictive. It's ingenuity, time-traveling twist ups and wonderfully vibrant characters resonate in ways few films ever achieve. It is an unadulterated cinematic experience!"
15.08.2015,10.0,"This is my absolute favorite childhood movie. I grew up with it and i'm extremely excited for it's return to the cinema in October 2015. It tells the story of Marty McFly portrayed by M.J.Fox. A boy who catches his best friend Doc (Emmett Brown) building a time machine out of a Delorean. Unfortunately Doc presumably dies by getting repeatedly shot in the chest by a bunch of Libyans. So Marty escapes from them by using the time machine and goes back to 1955. I am not going to furthermore spoil the plot, but it definitely gets more and more intriguing. Considering this is only the first movie of a trilogy i can honestly say that it is my favorite of the bunch, because of it's originality."
05.08.2015,10.0,"When I was little, my mom bought this movie on DVD for my dad. He turned it on one day and I brushed it off as ""one of those weird old movies daddy likes"". Eventually, I came out, sat down, and watched it. And the rest was history. I was so in love with this movie, that for 80's day at my school, I dressed up as Marty McFly. Nowadays, I love the movie more than ever. My favorite thing about this movie is the relationship between Doc and Marty. Most of the time, when a kid or teen hang out with an older person in movies and TV, people think they're more than friends. How many jokes have you heard involving Batman and Robin's relationship? However, Marty and Doc's relationship is pure friendship. I'm really good friends with one of my drama teachers, so I know how strong that type of friendship is. What else can I say? I love everything about this movie! If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now. Like...right now. Stop what your doing and go see it."
03.08.2015,10.0,"I've watched this movie so many times, I can quote the entire movie. I'm not giving anything away by saying it was/is still ahead of it's time. Although the characters' belief that 2015 would be significantly different than our current 2015 actually IS, is irrelevant (actually, it's a comedy so the guesses at reality just makes it funnier!). Robert Zemeckis directed a legendary movie mocked and satirized in many movies afterward. That's the highest praise a picture can garner. This is as near-to-perfection as screen comedy/time travel gets in my book.To put the writing/directing in perspective, I will tell you what my screen writing teacher said about this movie a few years ago when she screened just the opening sequence for our class... She said the opening sequence of nearly five minutes long with few editing breaks sets the stage for what is to come. She said this was how professional screenwriters dream about opening a movie. It's just... flawless. The opening reveals layer upon layer of story themes with very few words, just visuals and a few key noises in the background. Without a single actor in the midst. It's just the setting and a moving camera. We have just been treated to circa-1985 without ever even seeing an actor walking across screen. THEN the actor walks in. It only gets better from there. Magnificence in direction.Watching it again last night made me realize how special of a movie it really was. I simply enjoyed the experience. It transported me back to 1985 all over again. Knowing everything there is to know about the story. And it STILL makes me laugh. The fact they set it in 1985 was a stroke of genius. People in 2015 can only joke about what they believed the future would look like. But the writers/director so very wisely chose to say ""1985"" and not ""Present Day"" -- a date-reference killer once a movie reaches an age where current present day looks nothing like the movie we're watching. That 1985 date also allows for a perfect anchor to bounce around in the future two sequels in the series.I remember watching this in the theater when it was first run in - yes, I was there - 1985. My best friend sitting next to me in the theater watched Michael J Fox stumble along 1955 Main Street and his comment at that moment in the movie was, ""Nobody could play this character better than Michael J Fox."" I have to agree. MJF IS Marty McFly personified. He carries the picture effortlessly and heroically, along with the hilarious and severely underrated Christopher Lloyd as the genius/basket case, Dr. Emmitt Brown. Two genius actors playing off one another, along with the perfect supporting cast, makes this a must-watch movie at any time in history. It is genuinely funny, sweet, nostalgic, witty, beautiful, and exciting. Every scene has something to do with another scene. There is literally not a single wasted frame in this movie. Later episodes of the series aren't as perfect as BTTF1 but that's a different story... If anyone ever creates a time-capsule, PLEASE make sure to include this movie. Future millennia of species will enjoy it too. :-)If you haven't watched ""Back to the Future"" before, regardless of your age or generation, please reward yourself with this near-perfect time-travel comedy. I loved it even more this time around. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. 10 out of 10."
26.07.2015,5.0,"Come on, Back to The Future isn't all that great. Yes it has its moments, courtesy of Christopher Lloyd's slightly crazy Doc, Michael J. Fox' wide eyed looks of confusion and some superb special effects but the pace falters, the humour runs dry one too many times and because of all the positive buzz, constant recommendations and reviews stating it to be one of the best films, and standing high in the IMDb top 250 I can't help but feel disappointed and underwhelmed. Robert Zemeckis is a good director, countless hit films especially Flight which is an incredible movie. But people hailing this as some of his finest work? No, seriously this is an average film at best."
24.07.2015,10.0,"Back To The Future is one of my most favorite movies ever created. Just everything about this film is pure golden I can't think of one thing that would make Back To The Future bad because it just one of those films that got something right from the start.The film gave us some of the most used and most creative catch praises that we are still using even more after the film's release. It's one of those films I can always sit down and enjoy because it everything that makes it a pure classic.The idea of Time travel is always pure interest and it made the film a hit from the Get go.The music in the film is just superb often times you'll find yourself thinking about the theme song because it really matches the film story throughout also ""The Power of Love"" from Huey Lewis and the News really works well to help with Marty McFly and his love for girl friend Jennifer.The cast did a excellent job with creating some of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema Michael J.Fox was brilliant as the film Main Protagonist Marty McFly he helped created a character that most could related to in their teenage years he was the right man for the job. Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown was no doubt the perfect choice, Christopher Lloyd has always been an amazing actor and like many grew up watching his performance in this film he was just phenomenal in this role one of the smarter casting choices ever he really brought the character to life. Thomas F.Wilson as Biff Tannen was quite the antagonist he just brought back all that we know and hate about bullies and makes you want to cheer for Marty.Using the DeLorean as the time travel car really gave the car it status as part of American motion picture history every time you see the DeLorean you think of Back To The Future. The effects in this film are nothing short of being magical and even today remains impressive.Back To The Future is like a fine wine only gets better with age that's saying something for this classic masterpiece I give Back To The Future a 10 out of 10 Great Scott! When this baby hits 88 miles per hour you're going to see some serious hit"
21.07.2015,10.0,"As a child, I used to watch this movie religiously. I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!"
20.07.2015,7.0,"You should not watch Back to the Future looking for serious, intriguing thought experiments regarding time travel. You should watch it for what it is: a Hollywood blockbuster that seeks to make money through people's entertainment. And the profit-seeking motive is quite clear from the beginning: you see brand placement EVERYWHERE. Back to the Future, then, has all the ingredients for a Hollywood blockbuster: funny characters, unlikely plot denouements that you see coming way before it happens, very cliché characters such as the town bully, the timid nerd that becomes a hero, the damsel in distress. Also, as a 1985 blockbuster, it includes racism and sexism that would probably not be tolerated nowadays, such as the main actor shouting ""the Libyans!"" as a synonym of ""the bad guys!"", or the main character literally planning to abuse of a girl, which happens to be his mother.That being said, the movie does achieve it main goal: it is truly entertaining. I'm not the kind of person who laughs out loud when watching comedies, but in this case I couldn't avoid it. There are truly remarkable situations, especially with Marty's mother. The doctor's character is also particularly well-made, and the actor's performance is notable. In general, the creators did a good job in showing all the different funny situations that would arise from bringing an 80s kid to 1955, such as him playing rock'n roll in front of an awed audience, or Marty saying that a TV program that is just being aired is a classic that he watched in a rerun.So once you understand you shouldn't have high hopes for this movie, and that you should only look for having a good time, this movie will be very satisfactory. There are more artistic movies, better written plots, better directed ones, even funnier ones. But very often, these movies don't remain in the collective imaginary in the way this did it. The way this movie is part of today's pop culture should not be understated."
04.07.2015,10.0,"Now here's a film that manages to engender nostalgia for two different decades, while still remaining timeless. You don't see that every day. Strip away the ILM effects, space-time wrinkles and polished veneer and ""Back to the Future"" is really just about a kid witnessing his loser middle-aged parents during their high school years. It's such a novel idea and the movie that builds on that is just so precisely tuned. This was never a big effects movie and never promised huge Summer spectacle, but it does offer the honest thrill of going on an adventure. And that's tough to beat. It's got everything: action, science fiction, comedy, a teen movie subplot and (most importantly) an endearing relationship between two memorable characters (and let me say this right now: Christopher Lloyd steals every one of his scenes).For me, this is the total package of pure entertainment. It's lodged itself into the cultural lexicon and for very good reason. ""Back to the Future"" has been my favorite for years, and I just don't see that changing anytime soon. This is my idea of a perfect movie.10/10"
03.07.2015,10.0,"I literally made an account just to give a review to this movie and express my appreciation. I have to start by saying that the actors were absolutely amazing. They captured perfectly that revolutionary atmosphere of the 80's. I actually feel what is like to be a teenager in that period just by looking at the way they act. The script and the way it is made OMG i seriously don't know where to begin. All the jokes and punchlines are so carefully implemented, this movie has so many references to both real things like the joke with Ronald Reagan and things from the bttf universe, to give an example it would be the continuous repetitions that are always placed cleverly and even if you get a feeling of what is next you always end up satisfied. What this movie really tries to emphasize is that history repeats itself and that we create our own destiny. The amazing thing about this movie is how Marty travels back in time, a place where we believe we know everything about and we are somehow still mind-blown by every character and action and feeling .You just cannot not get that chill when u think of how irreversible time is and the way this movie captures all these emotions is simply extraordinary. The best movie experience i've ever had!!!"
20.06.2015,10.0,"That's because they are mirror versions of the same movie, showing how ""the time-warp continuum"" effect changes everything, both in the past and the future. (An unproven time travel theory ""made fun of"" in several movies, including ""Milllenium"". Also de-bunked in the 2 new ""Star Trek"" movies as old Spock meets young Spock face-to-face.) A genius of an idea born out of necessity, as ""George McFly's"" actor failed to ""sign-up"" for Part II! The DeLorean auto was a great choice as a time machine. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Lea Thompson carry the entire series. Mary Steenburgen in Part III is wonderful. ""Einstein-the Dog"" deserves a canine ""Oscar"" award! Basically a ""fish-out-of water"" classic, if follows the mis-adventures of two bumbling ""nerds"" as they stumble through time, in three different movies, from 1885 to 2015 with a constantly malfunctioning time machine, leaving behind messy continuity errors that need to be cleaned up to avoid disastrous events in time. Clever use of special effects (all optical) abound throughout. Much use of split screen as in ""Parent Trap"". Michael appears as his own ""daughter"" in drag (part II) and looks wonderful (though more than a bit creepy!) A few almost-innocent racist comments and situations, including two lines edited out (on the DVD version) involving the timeliness of the words ""colored and black"" in 1955. Easily Fox and Lloyd's best movie roles ""of-all-time"". ""The Power of Love"" is still a great song!"
14.06.2015,10.0,"The best and most influential film was. I just love every scene and my favorite actor is Michael J. Fox. The second part was very good too and I loved the laces coming long ago, yet it is mainly small but still enjoy the movie when I hear or see a good bit of Power Of Love Music. However, the third part. Infolog should then was good but unfortunately he became weak and boring in my opinion. If you do not want to have to get more money out of scratch it then do not go straight for one year it was sold out of the third one. But even which well animated movie beats. What is the worth of a good animation is a good CGI is an action movie when the story was rich does not tie up the man. So Back to the future : 10/10 Back to the future part 2 : 10/9 Back to the future part 3 : 10/7"
03.05.2015,,"a lovely movie.or maybe more because, generation by generation discovers it as fresh. for the mixture of themes, for performances, for Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, for the realistic atmosphere, music, cars, the spirit of 1955 or 1985 and for romanticism, for the travel in time and the form of miracles. a film who has status of cultural phenomenon because it reflects a large sphere of expectations from the public. a film for each age and for each period. short - a smart Zemeckis, right doses of adventure, science and humor. its secret - the wise use of universal ingredients of a good popular film. and that could be all. nothing complicated by seductive at all."
22.04.2015,10.0,"What else needs to be said? Anyone that knows anything about filmmaking knows that this is the best film ever made. Try watching certain movies over and over and see how quickly you get sick of it. This movie is different. The depth and richness of storytelling, the characters, oh my, the characters. Doc Brown is easily one of the best and most memorable on screen characters in any film ever. Biff, Griff, Buford...best on screen bully ever! Compare this movie to other epic movies, such as Star Wars - while those types of movies are great in their own right, Back to the Future is different. There is a warmth and comfort to the way that Bob Gale and Bob Zemekis crafted this screenplay. It's pure genius. And for all of you fans that always have to mention ""plot holes"" or ""minor flaws"" - please make sure you have seen every second of the 25th Anniversary set of the trilogy that has an entire bonus disc, as well as more bonus features and two different commentaries on the main discs. Bob Gale is aware of every little detail about his script and talks about it in the commentaries. My true love of this film came as a result of watching all the behind the scenes material - which if you haven't seen, you must see it if you're a fan of this movie. It will give you a whole new level of appreciation for this film. As someone that is into filmmaking and a total nerd about directing, cameras, technical details, I can't get enough of watching and listening to these guys talk about how everything came together just right for this masterpiece to happen. I can't say enough about this film, its actors and all the people involved in making it. Truly something not to be rivaled and we will probably never see anything close to it ever again."
12.02.2015,9.0,"Fresh off the success of ""Romancing the Stone"", Robert Zemeckis parlayed his newfound clout into the highest grossing movie of 1985 - ""Back to the Future"". A combination of science fiction and nostalgia, the movie touched a chord with contemporary audiences and continues to resonate with viewers thirty years later.The movie's protagonist is Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time thirty years. After he unwittingly prevents his parents' first meeting he must make things right or else he'll nullify his own existence.Although the premise is science fictional, the treatment is more or less fantastical, with only a superficial attempt to explain the technology behind time travel. Regardless, the souped-up DeLorean and its flux capacitor make for an iconic time machine.Meanwhile, the Oscar-nominated original screenplay offers something for everyone. In addition to the overall element of science fantasy spectacle there's action, adventure, romance, comedy & even surprising dramatic depth at times.However, the story may not have come to life so vividly without the movie's well-assembled cast. Replacing Eric Stoltz after shooting had already begun, original choice Michael J. Fox was thankfully able to accept the lead role at that juncture. Today, it is difficult, if not impossible, to envision anyone better suited to the role of Marty McFly. In support, Christopher Lloyd is likewise irreplaceable as Doc Brown. The icing on the cake is Marty's parents, enthusiastically played by the lovely Lea Thompson and the always interesting Crispin Glover.Zemeckis's direction also leaves little to be desired. The movie has an attractive look throughout and even the thirty year old special effects have held up pretty well. Musically, the movie benefits greatly from Alan Silvestri's rousing orchestral score. The pair of soundtrack contributions from Huey Lewis and the News are also memorable.Overall, ""Back to the Future"" offers high concept thrills backed up by considerable film-making prowess. Iconic in many respects, the movie is among the best, and the most entertaining, of the 1980's."
05.12.2014,,"The story line: Marty McFly, a typical American teenager of the Eighties, is accidentally sent back to 1955 in a plutonium-powered DeLorean ""time machine"" invented by slightly mad scientist. During his often hysterical, always amazing trip back in time, Marty must make certain his teenage parents-to-be meet and fall in love - so he can get back to the future.Review: The movie is so hilarious because it is predictable and weird.""Your future is whatever you make it."" You will get power and hope from the movie. This movie has an amazing ending. You will enjoy it.And there are (Back to the Future II) and (Back to the Future III).Just because of this, we can know how an outstanding movie it is. But its score just has 8.5, it is underrated.Above of these three movies are so excellent. The serial films of (Back to the Future) are worth watching."
03.12.2014,9.0,"You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all."
19.11.2014,9.0,"A young man (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all."
04.11.2014,10.0,"Steven Spielberg is a genius for Produce Back To The Future, he strikes the perfect balance between superior quality and self- depreciation. Robert Zemeckis directs with brisk pacing, making every scene count and sharply defining the key characters. While the film never aims for more than two dimensions, Marty is eminently likable, and Lloyd makes Doc Brown, with his wild white hair and perpetually wide eyes, one of the more memorable mad scientists in movie history.Lea Thompson gets the least showy but most delicate role. The film handles the potentially precarious covetous relationship between the young Lorraine and her teen-aged son with a playfully steady hand, and steers it to an unexpected but in retrospect obvious resolution.The DeLorean leaving flaming tire marks as it launches into time travel is one of my favorite scenes and i love Elisabeth Shue :)"
27.10.2014,10.0,"An outstanding sci-fi adventure - one of the coolest movies ever produced. Yes it's great to watch if you enjoy good comedy, science fiction and are interested in the concept of time travel.I was 13 years old in 1985 and, like most kids who watched this film, I wanted a really super cool time traveling delorean just like Doc and Marty. The idea of time travel will get you thinking and wishing you could go back in time. It seems like a lot of fun but the paradoxes that time travel could create might be a bit bizarre just as Doc (Lloyd) and Marty (Fox) found out.This sci-fi is a wonderful classic and is still great by today's film standards.10/10"

Marty's dream is to become one of the best guitar players in the world but he thinks about giving this dream up when his band is rejected for the high school prom night. The same day, Doc calls Marty and asks him to come at 1 a.m on a car park in town and at this point, the movie knows an unexpected turn... This movie is one of the best ""sci-fi comedies"" that I ever seen because it has all the elements to make you laugh and give you some suspense with an extraordinary soundtrack."
22.10.2014,9.0,"Contemporary high schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) doesn't have the most pleasant of lives. Browbeaten by his principal at school, Marty must also endure the acrimonious relationship between his nerdy father (Crispin Glover) and his lovely mother (Lea Thompson), who in turn suffer the bullying of middle-aged jerk Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's dad's supervisor. The one balm in Marty's life is his friendship with eccentric scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd), who at present is working on a time machine. Accidentally zapped back into the 1950s, Marty inadvertently interferes with the budding romance of his now-teen aged parents. Our hero must now reunite his parents-to-be, lest he cease to exist in the 1980s. It won't be easy, especially with the loutish Biff, now also a teenager, complicating matters. Beyond its dazzling special effects, the best element of Back to the Future is the performance of Michael J. Fox, who finds himself in the quagmire of surviving the white-bread 1950s with a hip 1980s mindset."
11.09.2014,8.0,"When I review films or shows I rate them on what they should be, in my opinion.Back to the Future is funny and has a great story line. Yes it's cheesy in parts but only a little. The 2nd and 3rd are very good as well but the first is definitely the best.Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in it. He portrays a mad scientist very, very well. Best time machine film I've seen.Michael J. Fox plays Marty, a cool kid who is eager to get into the music industry very well as well I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!Back to the Future=8/10"
03.09.2014,8.0,"Back to the Future. Remarkably clever, witty and hilarious sic-fi ever made. When Marty played by adorable Michael J. Fox is accidentally sent 30 years back in time, he needs to make sure his teenage parents fall in love in order to save his own existence. When you go back in time where you were not supposed to be at all, you actions can change the course of your own future. This concept creates lot of hilarious situations and full credit goes to writer-director Robert Zemeckis and his team for consistently imaginative screenplay, excellent music and back ground score, witty dialogs and emotional connect between characters. All supporting actors have done a pretty decent job especially Christopher Lloyd playing the crazy scientist and Crispin Glover playing Marty's timid father. Don't miss this cult sci-fi classic. It is one of those rare clever and really funny comedies."
27.08.2014,10.0,"Time travel and the possibilities it offered, of altering the past, knowing the future, meeting people/beings from the future, has always fascinated people. Renowned authors from H.G Wells and Isaac Asimov to Charles Dickens have given their interpretation of time-travel. Hollywood too brought out movies like Terminator and the Star Trek franchise. They had all used it on a grand scale, to explore things like ethics and/or future societies. Nobody thought of placing it in a simple high-school setting and using it to comic effect until Back to the Future came along.A teenager, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally transported to 1955 (which is 30 years ago since the present day for this movie is 1985). There he interferes with the moment his high-school-age parents meet, to fall in love later, thereby endangering his own existence. To prevent that from happening, Marty has to play match-maker to his parents. What we have is a very entertaining comedy full of enjoyable characters like the eccentric scientist, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), the school bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) and his sidekicks, Marty's parents, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover) and the school principal Strickland (James Tolkan). It also manages to have a few tense moments towards the end. It's funny, it's intelligent, and it expands the scope of time-travel by focusing on smaller events."
16.08.2014,8.0,This is the first good time traveling movie i can remember. It is for all the family and it's success will last for more than 2 Generation. Both sequel are great as well. After this trilogy time travel movies were never so fun. The characters are well played in this movie and all the sequels. And the interaction between them are great. I wish there will be another trilogy some day. Maybe with MJF son. Enjoying these movies as a child and as an adult sees it all. just enjoy over and over again. This is defiantly on of the best movies of the 80's. Marty McFly is a the main character and by trying to help his friend Dr. Emmett Brown he jumps back in time. this take him to an Adventure in which he must not ruin the future as he knows it while trying to get back to his time. doing that he interact with his family once they were younger. Will he succeed or will he stuck forever in the past. will he change history forever? it all depend on his friend Dr. Emmett Brown younger self which only he can help get back home
13.08.2014,10.0,"I have been re-watching this film for the past few decades and it never ceases to disappoint, proving to be a timeless classic. Is one of the few films that have tackled the impossibly complicated theme of time travel in an easy to understand manner.The BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy is also one of the few special set of three films that tie in perfectly together. They were not tacked on as a result of the first film achieving box-office success. Rather, they exist as perfectly complimentary films, vital for the complete story arc of each character to unfold."
09.08.2014,6.0,"As much as I like back to the future and the trilogy the films don't make sense as many things are time paradox's although not as present in this film as the 2nd it does have many mistakes which make you think ""great Scott"" how does that work.The storyline is good as it has made several parodies and we even get a second glance in the second film the casting works well although going back in time is something new plus martyrs reaction to the 1950s is like going to new country they do things differently theirThe film where the storyline makes sense is interesting where Katy is forced into last resorts to get his parents together but in the end he has destroyed his life as he no longer knows what as happens in his life it is different nowAll in all the movies good but it like I said has several plot holes which need filling."
25.07.2014,10.0,"One of the best movies EVER! Back the The Future is movie on time traveling. Time traveling has always been exciting and fun. I've watched this and About Time which are movies about time traveling and both are awesome. BTTF is TOO Awesome. Couldn't believe this was a 1980s movie.BTTF trilogy is an incredibly awesome adventure taken by Marty McFly and Dr.Emmett Brown. Dr.Emmett Brown a crazy, funny scientist invents the time machine, the biggest dream of his life. And Marty who is his friend gets to be a part of this awesome adventure by mistake. The best thing about this movie is how it shows whatever happens is bound to happen whether you want or not. And how with change in your attitude or with some help you can completely change your whole life. ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" - Dr. Emmett Brown Back to the Future is an amazing movie. This 1985 movie is so much better in quality as compared to the movies nowadays which have a shallow impact on the audience. You will actually feel connected to the movie and glued to your seats till the end There are not many movies of 8.5-like rating which are packed with Comedy, Drama, Adventure of such level... It's a MUST WATCH for all.Hope you all enjoy it too. Cheers!"
15.07.2014,9.0,"Lots of tongue in cheek. Some great characterization. A chance at redemption. These movies showed Michael J. Fox to be a wonderful comedic presence. It is sad what happened to him, but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in ""The Good Wife"" as the slimy, underhanded character lawyer he plays, I love that I can ""not like"" a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie, Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father, a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then, of course, there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel, there is a kind of suspense that works very well. It's pure fun and is the best of the three films in my opinion."
07.07.2014,10.0,"I think this is one of the best movies of all time. The story is about 17 years old Marty McFly, who lives in 1985 Hill Valley, California, who is accidentally sent back to 1955 in a DeLorean turned time machine. Stuck there, he must seek out the younger version of his friend Dr. Emmett L Brown to ask for help returning to 1985.However, his problems are about to get worse, as he prevents his first meeting and has to try everything he can to get them together, or he cease to have existed.It is a fun-filled sci-fi comedy adventure, and it is at the top of my all-time favourite movies list.The music and characters are just perfect.Story: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Satisfaction: 10/10Overall: 10/10"
25.06.2014,8.0,"Movie starts with a casual commoner's story escalating to his love story and craze for science. A guy that happens to be a scientist's assistant falls in the limo of bad consequences leading him to traveling into the past (that car is invented by the same scientist who actually wanted to show the boy an achievement of his lifetime). Boy fled back to the history where he had to search for the doc to get back to his time, but he bumps into his parents causing disruption in nature's time continuum. He finds scientist and convinces him to make the boy travel back to his time, but scientist says firstly fix the disruption you caused or else you will falsify your own existence. Movie is a whole quest of boy in fixing time machine and getting things settled in order to avoid his own disintegration. In 20th century you must watch this movie to know what science was, a decade ago"
16.06.2014,6.0,"It is extremely weird that i am disappointed by a movie that i enjoyed thoroughly. Back To The Future is a master piece concept which is also ful of fun but yet there was grossness and absence of ""extraordinary"" in the script.I am sure the director never thought that this movie can be such a success and that is why he never paid much attention to make it overwhelmingly smart, appropriate and courageous. No doubt one can enjoy the trilogy and feel satisfied but i see a lot of doors left open untouched which if were cared, would have given the shape of metropolis to the grandeur. The movie is awesome but not beneficial or thought provocative. I rated it less for miss or less-using and then stabilizing the special concept which leaves no ground open in the viewers to allow something scientific and technically correct. Being a great person it becomes responsibility to take care of many aspects for others which i didn't find in this movie.The amazing points of the movie includes two characters, the guy and the scientist, the most fitting comic faces to let you understand that whatever you are going to watch is going to be enjoyable. Next is the memorable vehicle that can travel in time. Third is the amazing area and landscape used to avoid the time travel giving clumpsy look. That is something intelligent film making."
14.06.2014,9.0,"My brother is to blame for my love of this film he used to watch it none stop on VHS back in the day and you get dragged into it just simply by being in the room. I think I have now watched this movie over 50 times if not more and it still keeps it's appeal even now as a young adult I still enjoy watching it and I don't get tied of watching it! The other 2 movies are also well worth watching but you can't beat the original. I love the story line and you get to know each character quickly and you can relate to each one of them especially Marty played by Fox, I understand he was working on family ties and back to the future all at the same time wow he must have been tired.I would like to point out how cleaver this movie is because of the time travel element this is not easy to pull off but they do it so well. This is one of my all time favorite movies and I am sure I will still be watching it when my grand kids are around."
09.06.2014,9.0,"So I guess I'm not the first person to say this, lmao, but I love this movie! It's such a gem. It has a really sweet sense of humor, and romance, and adventure to it that you don't get in movies that much anymore. Well maybe that isn't totally fair, but you know what I mean.And for a Time Travel movie, it doesn't really mess up too badly in terms of continuity or paradoxes. The movie handles it all pretty much in stride. I can get kind of nitpicky about stuff, and I never felt betrayed or hornswaggled by the filmmakers on this one.I will always suggest this to friends, and if you haven't seen it then put it on your list!"
08.06.2014,7.0,"My favorite movie is ""Back To The Future"" which is made by Robert Zemeckis. The main point of the movie is time exploration using time-machine. It was memorable from beginning to end. I think the moment that Marty tries to make the link was moving. Because the link could holds two people together. At that moment I thought what would happen to them if Marty does not make his parents meet? I cannot imagine. It is not really predictable. I want to watch other sequels if I have free time. Therefore, I want to recommend that you watch the movie, Back To The Future."
05.06.2014,8.0,"After you forget about science and logic, this movie is really enjoyable. You don't have to consider the fact that it's a thirty years old film,to understand the magnitude of it's success as a sci-fi comedy. I don't think even today they couldn't make this any better. The performance from Michael J. Fox was memorable. The poster looks really bad-ass. Special effects were not unbelievable. All the characters were likable, even the bad guys. The best thing I liked about this film is that it is different than any sci-fi comedy in every way possible. Even 30 years from now this film will make the new watchers laugh the same way as now."
28.05.2014,9.0,"If you wanna watch a very intelligent time travel movie, this one isn't it. However if you wanna see the beginning of a fantastic, adventurous yet well interwoven, grafted and entertaining time travel trilogy this one is the ticket. The thing that makes this movie stand out and endure the test of time is the classic elements that makes a movie such as this memorable with likable characters. And a mission you actually care about as the audience members. Michael J. Fox is just great a Marty McFly who may seem like a typical 80's main teenage character, but there is certain aspects about him that makes him a cool and stands out from the rest. Maybe it's his capability to stand up to bullies even if he is smaller in stature. While also having the courage to follow his dreams and how he conducts himself, despite his flaws of not being able to turn down a challenge. But Christopher Lloyd is the guy that just plain downright nailed it as the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown. Even when it came down to the main villain Biff played by Biff Tannen, who is basically a generic bad guy of this trilogy, but certain elements makes him kind of a stand out villain for me. Maybe because you can see different versions of him, even if he is the bad guy all the way through. Watching this movie was like watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie with a touch of Spielberg's elements, except this trilogy will go down as a classic trilogy. This may seem like a typical 80's movie from the surface, but it has a lot of elements that makes it brilliant. It's difficult to describe in words, but this movie, this trilogy just works and will stick with you. When it comes to the story it's actually very simple, but sometimes the simple aspect of a film makes it more worthwhile sometimes even if it deals with time travel. Watching this even now I can understand why a movie like this can be a timeless classic and give kids a colorful imaginative ideas. I for one tried to build a time machine with my brother when we were younger after watching this movie and had a blast! 9/10"
11.04.2014,10.0,"When you're reviewing a film that you love, it's hard sometimes to describe all the things that you love about it. Which is the greatest challenge I have in reviewing this. I'll try not to go into too much detail, but I will also try to go in as deep as possible as to why I love the film. When the film opens we're introduced to the Character of Marty McFly. He's a typical 80's teen, but also good natured at heart. Marty has dreams and aspirations of being a rock star, but is too unsure of himself to pursue them. He is best friends with the eccentric but lovable, Dr. Emmett Brown. We don't know how Marty and Doc became friends, but we can understand why they are. Doc is always guiding Marty to do what is right, and indirectly showing him to never give up. Their relationship in the film is one I really love, Because Doc is not just a mentor to Marty, he's also a somewhat surrogate parent. The plot is simply this: Doc calls Marty up, and asks him to come help him with his new invention: A Delorean time machine. Things go wrong, and Marty ends up sending himself back in time to 1955. Shortly afterward, Marty accidentally interferes with his parents meeting. So Marty must now try to repair the damage he caused, while Doc tries to find a way to send Marty back home. So, what do I love about the film? To begin with, everything! I love the film's concept: If I knew my parents in high school, would I be friends with them? When you're a kid, the only way to find out how your parents acted when they were your age was to ask a grandparent or relative, but think how different and exciting it would be to actually see it! I love the film's message: ""Never give up, and never stop trying."" I love the performances that all the actors give, and I love the re-creation of the '50's atmosphere. (I'm a big fan of '50's movies, music, and TV shows.) I just love the film all around. Would I recommend this to someone who hasn't seen it? YES, absolutely! Back to the future is one of those movies that you can watch multiple times, and with each time, it still holds as much magic as the first."
05.04.2014,9.0,"Back to the Future is everything good about movies. It's almost flawless, from casting, music, acting, set design, pacing directing et al. But the whole is so much better than the sum of it's parts. All these elements combine to create an experience bursting with excitement, adventure and wonder. It is a pure example of a wholeheartedly fun movie.Most of the movies charm comes from it's simplicity, we are presented with these few ever so memorable characters; Marty McFly, Doc Brown, Biff and a (time-travel aside) simple, thrill filled plot line. We are then hurtled through a joy ride of an adventure, filled with suspense, wonder, spectacle and a host of other emotions, coming out the other side in awe.It is endlessly re watchable in it's simplicity, but is never dull."
25.03.2014,10.0,"The movie takes us on a great time travel where a teenager McFly meets his parents when they were teenagers. He both needs to get back to 1985 but before that to get his parents to fall in love with each other so he doesn't get erased from the existence.The movie is absolutely great. It has so much energy and there is always something happening. It is also great to look into the past. Nowadays 1985 is old times as well so the movie has twice the charm when we get to see both the 80's and the 50's. And the writers did a great job to make jokes to show us the differences between those times. Even as somebody who hasn't lived in the 50's I could get them, and the jokes about let's say Marty's 80's vest are even more hilarious to us now. So the movie aged very well, if it didn't even get better.The casting is also perfect. Michael J. Fox is the right actor for Marty. He was not the one cast at first but I am so glad they got him. Even though Eric Stoltz is a great actor, but the footage with him from Back to the Future had a more serious feeling to it, it kind of was losing the charm I love so much. Maybe then there would be no other sequels.Christopher Lloyd created a great persona as Doc. If I see a picture of him I would always recognize him. He always has this great crazy scientist in him. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover who played Marty's parents made a wonderful performance by being them at different ages. The make up artists also contributed to the success of it.I loved this movie as a kid, I love it now. It has everything that I like for such a genre: great cast, a fun story, great lines, well connected plot and perfect time setting. One of the movies I can watch again and again."
23.03.2014,10.0,"I love this movie. Since child. This film is very good, Michael J. Fox, was perfect for the role of Marty. The characters are unforgettable, Dr. Brown with his crazy ideas, a plot that makes you want to keep watching until the end. some amusing scenes, others that became classics. The best science fiction movie of the 80s. My 9 year old nephew loves this trilogy. I'm only 23, but I grew up watching this film, my favorite is the second. It is impossible to watch and not like. I think it's cool how everything connects this film. Marty is a cool character, like me and perhaps you, is an ordinary guy. It is the dream of every human being, able to travel in time, and we have fun when we see it in a movie. My score for this film is: very cool, best science fiction movie of the 80s. Never get tired of watching"
13.02.2014,10.0,"Back to the Future is one of the best movies ever made. It has a great stroy, has funny lines, and has great characters as well.Marty travels back in time accidentally by using Doctor Emmett Brown's time machine. There he must figure out a way to get back to the future and also get his parents to fall in love since he accidentally interferes with their first meeting.The story is great in this film. Time travel is a tricky thing but I think that this film does a simple job of explaining it so that general audiences can understand it more. However it still has a lot that confuses me but I guess with time travel in a movie the more that you think about it the more that you will have your mind boggled. So it is best just to accept what happens and not over think it.Marty is a great leading character who people can probably relate to. Michael J. Fox is awesome as him. Also Christopher Lloyd is amazing as Doctor Emmett Brown, this is probably his best acting performance in a film. Overall the relationship between Marty and Doc is believable and well done and it is one of the major things these films have going for them.The main antagonist Biff is also great. He really is just the type of jerk that seems to exist in a lot of 80s movies.The conflict of the story is great and it really keeps you at the edge of your seat. No matter how many times I see it, this film still keeps my attention even though I know what will happen.The score and song selections in this film are also well done.I highly recommend this film. If you have not seen it, do so right away and you will not be disappointed."
08.02.2014,10.0,"This is one of the first American movies I had ever seen when I was around 10 years old. And now it is the only one movie which I could watch over and over again without getting bored. It is just perfect, the energy of the actors and the whole action is incredible! I can't understand why I'm not getting tired of it and the only explanation I have is that this is a real art and a real talent gathered together. This movie is an evidence of magic that exists on this planet somehow and that the magic can come in our hearts right from the screen in the cinema! My huge dream is to become a part of something as significant as ""Back to the Future"" movie in my life!I will make sure my children will watch it and will love it as much as I do! Thank you for a tremendous work, guys! God bless you all :)"
06.02.2014,10.0,"If you only ever see one time travel movie in your life -- this would be the one to see. It's got everything you could ever wish for in a movie of this genre: fun and imagination, action and drama, thrills and spills, love and family, mystery and science, music and dance, heart and soul.Great for the whole family to watch together, young and old, and repeat viewing is a pleasure each and every time. It never gets old.Do yourself a favour and allow yourself to be swept up by the moment, and dream of the possibilities.Rarely does a movie give you the satisfaction of sheer enjoyment as this."
30.01.2014,10.0,"Honestly, I could watch this into my grave. I saw this first when I was about 10 years-old and fell in love with it ever since. My first boyfriend asked me out by showing me this movie. Basically what I'm trying to say, is that this movie is fantastic. Back to the Future has elements for everyone, and is great for watching with the family or relaxing by yourself. The DeLorean has become such an icon, and it's no wonder! The film sets up great jokes and entertainment throughout the entire story, and fantastic one-liners. ""Great Scott!"" ""Man this is heavy"" and my personal favorite ""Why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?"" are some of the best in movie history. This 80s classic never fails to disappoint, and is always going to be my number one movie."
23.01.2014,9.0,"Lou: You going to order something, kid? Marty: Ah, yeah. Give me a Tab. Lou: I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Marty: Right. Give me a Pepsi Free. Lou: You want a Pepsi pal, you're gonna pay for it. Within that one single exchange between Back to the Future's (1985) protagonist Marty (Michael J. Fox) and the neighborhood soda jerk there are so many things going on. Marty has traveled back thirty years into the past and is slowly coming to terms/panicking about where he is and how he got there. Studebakers and old Mustangs drive by the window, the future mayor of Hill Valley (played by Donald Fullilove) mops behind him and a younger version of his father (Crispin Glover) sits right next to him. Yet all the audience is supposed to pick up is that the lingo in Hill Valley circa 1955 is completely different than what he's used to which leads to this hilarious exchange.While Pepsi Free no longer exists and Tab iswell Tab, the fact still remains that Back to the Future remains the epitome of a timeless classic. It's a classic based on its plot: a teenager who has befriended an oddball scientist (Christopher Lloyd) goes back into the past with his time machine and has to get back. It's a classic based on its sub-plot: said teenager messes up his mother and father's first meet and has to make the two fall in love before he's never born. It's a classic because of its state-of-the-art special effects which really haven't aged all that much and it's confident direction led by Robert Zemeckis. Finally it's a classic because of its humor and heart. How many times have you seen time travel in a movie and ask yourself honestly, whose done it any better?Back to the Future made full fledged movie stars out of its likable leading man Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Lloyd's Doc Brown is an unforgettable character that is permanently etched in this writers head. He's the gold standard of mad scientist that all future lab-coated eccentrics have to reach before I can deem them worthy. Fox's lovable Marty is smart, creative and surprisingly full of energy. Up until that point Fox had a regular gig on Family Ties (1982-1989) and had to work both projects averaging five hours of sleep for three months to finish the picture; it's a wonder he doesn't look like a wax statue.It is said that Robert Zemeckis had tried for months to get a meeting with Steven Spielberg before finally bursting into his office unannounced and showing him his USC student film. Spielberg (German for childhood hero) would go on to executive produce his first few movies including the solidly acted box-office failure Used Cars (1980). Around that time, Spielberg also produced films by Joe Dante, Chris Columbus and Kevin Reynolds, but it was Robert Zemeckis who left the biggest mark on cinematic entertainment. It was his attention to detail and early adoption of computer generated special effects in Back to the Future that established Zemeckis as a technical wunderkind. Zemeckis would follow the success of Back to the Future with the equally inspired Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and has since become a producer/director himself.Yet Back to the Future remains a timeless package of an auteur at his zenith. A tight, clean story told with energy and panache. It has no equal and will likely never be pushed off its perch as the king of unfettered quality entertainment. In the realm of childlike wonder, Spielberg may be king but his best film is arguably not one he has directed himself but one he produced. And that production is 1.21 gigawatts of awesome.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

I think it is funny how people thought 2015 was going to be. and now with it being 2014 and nowhere near as futuristic. Besides the Breakfast Club, this is my all time favorite movie. and my favorite 80's movie. I give it two thumbs up. everybody should watch this at least once in their lifetime. that's all I have to say. I don't have enough to write ten lines. i'm really just writing this because i want to get rid of that annoying side bar on my profile to be completely honest. 5 stars. 10 out of 10. two thumbs up. it's the bees knees. it's cash of the crop or whatever. it's the cherry on top. it's the bomb.com. it's the extra cheese on the extra-large pizza from pizza hut and you are home alone watching net-flix.... so yeah."

A charming and unique story with a blend of comedy and action. The acting is top notch, the pacing and character development are wonderful, and a film with such a unique and fantastical story are expertly directed and handled by Zemeckis and is handled in such a manner that it is entirely believable. The film taking place in two different times is handled very well the world of the squeaky clean 1950's is made very believable and the nostalgia factor is very high. The score and soundtrack not only assist the film but strengthen it and make it that much more beloved.

Fox's career took off with this futuristic Sci-Fi adventure,, I remember as a kid I loved this movie,,nd still do to this day,, sure it's dated, but I think that it has aged well,, Christopher Lloyd has always been one of my favorites and he did a great job in this.. Lea Thompson,, and Crispin Glover are very good in supporting roles as well.. basically time travel is explored in this movie,, and if it is possible,, there are some pretty cool looking futuristic cars in this movie,, like the DeLorean for example.. I just wish that Hollywood would make more of these kind of movies that stand the test of time,, instead of some of the dreck that seems to have came out over the past years."
27.12.2013,10.0,"When I need to watch anything related with travels in time, this is one of the movies that come to my head, and for be the first in the trilogy is the best!In that year, I'm really sure that things like science fiction were things of the future, but for be really far of the actual things, that was a great job.In my travel in time movies experience, I'm really excited with this great history.Thanks to all the production with this spectacular movie!I hope a reboot or remake is coming in the near future."
15.12.2013,10.0,"this is the best movie series i have seen yet. awesome concept and direction. this movie (especially the second part) could have become very complex and confusing, but very well thought and written and so everything is explained with no loop holes. all the characters have became legends for me since i watched this movie. In the second part, when the Dr. was explaining the time traveling concept to McFly, we all (me and my friends) went totally mad, paused the movie and discussed it on paper first and then continued with the movie. I am ever ready to watch this movie again and again with people who haven't seen it yet and discuss with them about the movie."
08.12.2013,9.0,"Back To The Future is one of those films that is universally loved and is one of the most referenced contemporary films of all time. Has there been any other time travel film that has created such an impact as this film? Not that I have seen, but it is arguable as I have not seen many time traveling films.Back To The Future is written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I am just get this out of the way and say that both are not the greatest of writers but they did have created an a concept that is so ambitious and at the same time so accessible that it is hard to not appreciate their writing contributions. Back To The Future's premise is the reason we watch this film and it's the reason that we keep getting hooked to it. Back To The Future's plot is ambitious, at times too ambitious that certain plot holes may be present in relation to the impact of Marty's influence, and the film also has an abundance of humor scattered throughout the film. The humor is one of the main reason that the film is so accessible and beloved, the jokes can be related to both the younger generation and the previous generation even if either generation is from the 50-80s era. The story of just having Marty's mother be infatuated with him, and lightly touches on Freud's Oedipal Complex, is hilarious and ridiculous that it still has it's effect with every viewing. Back To The Future also manages to create the most unique of friendships, a high school student and a slightly off scientist, because these characters are so well written that I didn't really mind the unbelievability of their friendship. Both writers have created a protagonist that is very close to a real teenager during the 80's and made him so appealing that every adolescent males want to be him and all teenage girls want him.Robert Zemeckis now is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary directors and Back To The Future is one of the reasons why that is so. Zemeckis was able to execute a film that has such an ambitious plot while maintaining a campy coming of age tone that can appeal to a multi-generational audience. Back To The Future and Romancing The Stone definitely made Zemeckis an important director and those become a stepping stone for him to create films with more artistic license. Back To The Future was able to create this sense of nostalgia and walk a tightrope between two generations of adolescence. Zemeckis was able to project that ability to recreate a time of adolescent youth that is relatable and fueled by references that defined that time period; Zemeckis has definitely created something that was similar to what George Lucas did for American Graffiti.Dean Cundey started off as a cinematographer of the most popular Horror films of all time, including Halloween and The Thing. After working with Zemeckis on Romancing With The Stone, he did a complete turn around working in much more light-hearted and optimistic films. Cundey did a decent job here and was able to juxtapose two different looks for the film, the dark and dirty look for the 80s and the warm and colorful look of the 50's. Cundey's photography isn't as in your face with nostalgia, like The Godfather, as it consistently takes a more contemporary style throughout the film. Cundey shoots this film to serve the plot and maintaining that accessibility and light hearted tone that Zemeckis wanted instead of drawing attention to itself. The cinematography for this film may not be as loved as the film's writing or musical score but Cundey doesn't slouch with this film.Alan Silvestri was brought in to compose the score for Back To The Future and what a wonderful job he has done here. Silvestri's score here is one of the most memorable film scores that competes with other films like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It has the ability to stick under your skin and will have you bobbing your head when it comes on. Huey Lewis' ""Power of Love"" is so catchy that it just stands out and had me singing the lyrics every time it comes on. The song is able to blend in with Silvestri's score which prevents me from drawing too much attention to it and feeling like it's out of place.Michael J. Fox is the star of this film, embodying this character who is a product of a rebellious and erratic generation. Fox brings personality to McFly by acting like how cool teenage adolescents were like in his time period. When he is sent back in time, Fox was able to portray this fish out of water kind of personality and emotion that makes his entrapment believable. Christopher Lloyd plays the slightly intense scientist who has created time traveling. Lloyd definitely has given such a memorable performance and nobody else was able to capture his performance in any other film. Lloyd was able to balance humor and the seriousness with such flourish that he was to place weight in the story of the scene. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover play Marty's parents and both do a very good job and was able to embody both their young and older self, though at times Glover at the start of the film was quite over the top and had me cringing a couple of times. Thomas F. Wilson was good as a cliché looking bully ""Biff"". He was able to give off this toughness quality that is able to make the McFly's feel inferior.Back To The Future by now is regarded as a classic and I can see why. This film will appeal to every generation and it's legacy will continue to grow as time passes. Back To The Future is still Zemeckis' best film and will forever remain as a timeless piece of cinema."
21.11.2013,10.0,"Back to the Future is the first movie in a series of 3. The film was written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. The film's origins stemmed from musings by Gale in that he wondered if he were to go to high school with his father, if they would have gotten along (Vs. what most Canadian boys think about ""gosh I wonder who my father is""). The movie went on to production only after Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone, as it was previously rejected before-hand. Back to the Future was produced through Universal Pictures by Steven Spielberg.Back to the Future is about a teen, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), who lives at home with his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson), father George (Crispin Glover) and siblings Dave and Linda (Marc McClure and Wendie Jo Sperber). With the unintentional aid of eccentric friend, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), Marty is sent back to the time of his parent's teenage years in a time machine that is powered by Plutonium. Marty then has to bring his parents together again while diverting his mother's romantic interest in Marty, making it very awkward, so he and his siblings would still exist.Back to the Future was the biggest movie for the year of 1985. Back to the Future was an all-time kids favourite and also enjoyed by adults, as I still watch the movie from time to time and thoroughly enjoy it. There have been other movies in production that copies the time travelling concept but hasn't come close to the greatness of Back to the Future."
01.11.2013,10.0,"I love this film and it's 2 sequels, I watched one on TV some years ago and loved it and went straight out and bought the Trilogy. It's a must watch for anyone at any age, I'm 16 and I love it and this film definitely has a long shelf life. As for the storyline,it's fantastic and Michael J. fox and Chris Lloyd have such a great friendship and they really do make the film. The fact they chose the Delorean as the time machine is even better. This is my favourite Spielsberg film by far and truly is one of my favourite films of all time. Also this film really manages to overcome the big loopholes which are very common in time travel films, but this film addresses these issues and discusses the ways of a paradox and how it's dangerous to change the past as it may cause danger in the future. WATCH IT! NOW!"
29.10.2013,9.0,"I was never born in the 80s but I call myself a product of the 80s, and this is my favorite part of it! Back To The Future as humor and action which I love about it! Michael does a great job acting as a teen aged boy how is crazy for the ladies and is the first time traveler ever! Chris plays the crazy Doc. who invented the time machine and made a mess in the first place! (Stealing some... well better not spoil it for you all). And the make this deal worth all your cash is there is three in the series and personally I think the first is the best the second and third is just as good, funny, and action packed!! In the second don't try and not want a hover board by the end of the movie and the third you want to visit the old west! If you love the 80s, or need something good to watch then pick up these movies now!!!"
28.10.2013,10.0,"The movie is more than excellent. There is a lot of hidden detail in the movie and you will only see them once you watch the movie again multiple times.The whole cast did an excellent performance, the music is awesome. This is not a movie, it's one of the 80s classics.I remember the first time I see it, when I was 5 y/o more or less, after that I just want to be Marti McFly and travel through the time, skate and drive a DeLorean. After more than 20 years, I've saw this movie at least 50 times and I'm finding new details, it's incredible the work behind each scene."
22.10.2013,,"This is how a film should be! It has everything you could ever want to see in one. Great, original story, fine acting and characterisation, fast pace, perfect musical score, satisfying ending, ah, I could go on and on.The chemistry between Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd is quite unlike anything I can think of in any other film. It is so natural, like they'd been working together for years.I tend to judge films by how many ""memorable moments"" it has, that is, outstanding scenes that you remember and want to see again and again. This film has many such, more than any other film I can think of.If you are not a film fan, or not seen this one, watch it and you'll be hooked - forever!Incidentally, the Blu-Ray rendering of this film is easily the best I have seen for a film of its age. Absolutely stunning."
14.10.2013,9.0,Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an average teen from a lower middle class family. His friend Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time traveling DeLorean. Dr Brown is about to travel back in time when the Libyans attack. Marty only escapes by using the DeLorean to go back to 1955. He changes history and must change it back before he disappears all together.Robert Zemeckis has woven together a wonderful charming story. It's perfectly constructed time loop. It certainly is one of the best feel good movie. Michael J Fox is the perfect guy to play the boy next door character. His interaction with his mother Lea Thompson in the past is wonderfully hilarious and Christopher Lloyd is perfect as the oddball scientist.
13.10.2013,10.0,"this film i would have to say is a must see, as no matter how old you are this film will entertain you for a very long time. the best sci-fi film that i have ever seen in my entire life, the way Michael j fox just tells out his characters story is amazing no matter what era he is be it the past or the future he just sells it 100%. you don't see films made to this standard anymore. the way each scene is set out in the future is amazing, to be honest i would love to have the imagination that Robert Zemeckis has, as his directing and also writing skills truly shine in this fantastic unforgettable film. the hover boards are an amazing piece of technology i would honestly have to say that i would love one of them. also just the way Marty get asked his name in the wild west and says hes Clint Eastwood is just amazing."
18.09.2013,8.0,"Robert Zemekis directed this hugely entertaining Time-travel adventure comedy as Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back in time 30 years in a De Leorean converted Time machine invented by his eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Once in 1955, he accidentally intervenes in how his parents met, resulting in him being threatened from temporal erasure! He enlists the aid of the younger Dr. Brown, to help him put things right, and get back to his future...A fine cast, witty and inventive script, and inspired direction make this a most entertaining adventure, very exciting and funny, and filled with charm, and good-natured humor about the differences in culture that 30 years can bring."
14.09.2013,9.0,"I first watched this film when I was young, it having been recommended to me by my mother, and it remains a favourite still today. The storyline is, of course, a favourite to many, and I just loved it. The idea of time travel and the 'butterfly effect' is portrayed extremely well throughout the film, and Marty's difficulties sticking to the rules of time travel (not helped by certain characters he encounters) never fails to entertain me. The links between the people he meets in 1955 and the people in his life in 1985 are shown so well, and the comedy about the differences in technology always makes me laugh. The film was great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I was younger, as well as later on in my life."
07.09.2013,9.0,"Back to the Future is a movie about high schooler Marty McFly who has befriended a scientist who has a discovery worth a look. Doctor Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at the mall, where he reveals a Delorean... made for time travel. The Delorean is the vessel for Marty's adventures in this very well put together trilogy. In the first movie, Marty goes back to 1955, the year his parents met. Marty tries to get back home, but the Delorean won't start, so he has to live in 1955 for a while. In 1955, Marty finds Emmett Brown, and has to convince him that he helped him travel back in time 30 years later. Emmett is Marty's only hope in getting back to 1985, but Marty's being there in 1955 has changed a few things; so even if he does get back to the future, things could be different. Can Marty get everything back to normal and get back to 1985? Find out! Once you watch the first one, you'll HAVE to watch parts II and III."
03.09.2013,10.0,"Back to the future is probably one of the best movies if not the best movie I have ever seen. This movie is just fantastic, awesome and flawless. The action and suspense of this movie still excites to this day. You can watch this movie over and over again and still be thrilled. Most likely This is easily one of the best movies ever made. A must watch movie for anybody, any age, even if they aren't a very big movie person. Not much more to say.The movie has almost no flaws at all, and will not disappoint anybody who views it. A true classic that will endlessly entertain anyone. Overall a truly entertaining, memorable and amazing movie with very few flaws. Ten out of Ten stars."

Funny and full of adventure..everyone can go watch it over and over...beside it,s for all ages film.about the Co-start Doc Smart..supposed be genius and a lot of knowledge his character was fitting on his personality.

By the way I am a member Screen Guild Actors its nothing to loose, trying to be in this Hot film Back to the Future...with Hero Michel J. Fox and Vejouhn to the Next Generation..."
15.08.2013,10.0,"Maybe the most rewatchable movie there is, ""Back to the Future"" is great family-fun and one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox) is a teenager living in the 80's who's accidentally sent back in time to the 50's and after complicating his mother and father's soon to be relationship he must find a way to re-unite them for his own existence depends on it.If only for the skateboard scene only, this movie provides some of the funnest scenes you will ever find. The performances are very energetic and are hard to take your eyes off. It's a 116 min roller coaster ride you'll want to get on again once it ends.By the way here's an astonishing story I found online (I'm not sure whether it's true or not): ------------------------------------------------------------ I worked at Amblin' in the 80's when all this went down, and here is what really happened.Bob Zemeckis was given a firm start date by Universal. This was before he had any real power in the business; they said 'you will start on this date or we won't make the picture'. Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz.Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule.To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him. He was struggling with Bob Gale (who also wanted to direct), and going through a rough patch in his marriage, among other things.I've kept my mouth shut over the years because this is how the business works- it's not for the faint of heart.However, I find it a bit reprehensible that they are now making even more profit off this ugly little event by releasing the footage that by design was never meant to be good in the first place.Harvey Keitel shot a considerable amount of Apocalypse Now, but why don't we see Francis Coppola releasing that footage?Because he's got class. The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy."" ------------------------------------------------------------Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J. Fox, he's just too fun to watch.I'd recommend it to anybody, specially anyone who liked ""Star Wars"", ""Groundhog Day"", ""Looper"", ""Wall-e"", or ""Jurassic Park""."
09.08.2013,10.0,"You can't beat this film.Marty McFly goes back in time, in a DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown.The movie, in fact, resembles Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" more than other, conventional time-travel movies. It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another side of it.Because the movie has so much fun with the paradoxes and predicaments of a kid meeting his own parents, I won't discuss the plot in any detail. I won't even get into the horrifying moment when Marty discovers his mother ""has the hots"" for him. The movie's surprises are one of its great pleasures. Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit."
31.07.2013,10.0,"This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read ""IT"" by Stephen King or watch ""Twin Peaks"" by David Lynch for examplesThe next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom.The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !"
25.07.2013,9.0,"Where do I even start with ""Back to the Future?"" Director Robert Zemeckis has been known for sensational movies such as ""Cast Away,"" and ""Forrest Gump."" But ""Back to the Future,"" is by far my favorite of Zemeckis's movies. ""Back to the Future,"" is about a man named Dr.Emmitt Brown and his teenage friend Marty McFly. When Dr. Brown makes a time machine out of a 1981 DMC DeLorean, Marty accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past. When he meets his teenage mother, to Marty's disbelief, he notices that she is more interested in him other than his father. Marty now must plan out an event with his teenage father that he believes will unite them and his existence will then be saved. The overall feeling of this film is quite exhilarating, there is some action, some romance, and quite a bit of nostalgia that I think is essential in all great movies. Not to mention some memorable quotes such as ""Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that you made a time machine... out of a DeLorean?"" and ""Roads... where we're going, we don't need roads."" Overall, ""Back to the Future,"" is an instant classic and it has potential to be enjoyed by moviegoers of all ages."
18.07.2013,8.0,"A short review of Back to the Future (1985)With one Academy Award and a place in IMDb's Top 250 greatest movies of all time, Back to the Future has one on the best movies of the 1980s. Popular with the younger generation because of how it's about the younger generation and also popular with older people because of many reasons.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod are the stars of this movie about an 18 year old boy who has mostly everything going for him. a hot girlfriend, talented musician but not brilliant in his school life with a certain teacher who has a dislike for him because of his family who went to that school before. Until his friend the brilliant, but a bit mental scientist Dr. Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at 1am to show him his latest invention, A time-machine, but something goes wrong and it results in Marty ending up 30 years earlier in 1955. His only hope of getting back to the future is to get help from a younger Dr.Emmett Brown. While in 1955 he runs into the younger version of his parents and makes a mistake which could erase his own existence.It's a bit of a confusing storyline which still confuses people to this day. But that is just good writing. Written and Directed by Robert Zemecks and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg.It won an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing and was nominated for three others, with a rating of 8.5/10 puts itself at number 45 in the Top 250 and is critically acclaimed as one of the best movies of the 80s this movie is my 2nd of all time favorite and without a doubt one of the best movies ever made."
09.07.2013,10.0,"I'm a fan of all the Back to the Future movies. I love them because they are very cool and exciting, and they incorporate the styles of plots that I love most, comedy, action, adventure, and even a little romance.Anyone who watches this movie will not be disappointed, the actors are really awesome, and the plot idea is great. This movie is personally my favourite of the three. Marty (played by Michael J. Fox) is sent back in time to 1955 from a time machine created by scientist Doctor Brown,(played by Christopher Lloyd)where he interferes with the past, and has to make sure his teenage parents end up together."
15.05.2013,10.0,"This movie is an awesome movie! not just for families or kids but for adults to, this does have some funny moments and its just a great fun awesome movie , Coming from a director , Robert and Steven did an excellent job on this move , So STOP Reading this and watch it ! OK so here is the review AKA story line . So a teen named Marty McFly (Michael j Fox0 lives in 1985, his great friend Doc Brown (Christopher Loyd) A Cool Funny Wacky Scientist Builds a time machine from a Delorean . So that's all I'm going to say I don't wanna spoil :) so hurry up and go watch this movie. This is still one of my most common questions , No its not just for kids and families so hurry up and go watch it."
14.04.2013,10.0,"This is one of the few movies my nerdy sci-fi self never cared about if the science was right or wrong, or about any plot inconsistencies or whatever, because it is just an incredibly fun movie from 00:01 to credits. I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times since I was a kid. I can tell you which clock in the opening sequence had the wrong time on it. I can tell you Doc Brown's address both in the past and the present. I know what kind of dog food Einstein eats. I know this movie better than ""Holy Grail"", and that's saying something. This one, part 3, and to a lesser extent part 2 are three of the best comedy/adventure/sci-fi/feelgood movies of all time, in my opinion. One simply cannot watch this movie and be disappointed. Whether you are ten or sixty, you will enjoy this movie, and continue to enjoy it every time you see it. Another Z-man classic. Go '80's!"
07.01.2013,10.0,"Back to the Future is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. I never grow tired of this film, I know the story inside and out now and I still happily watch it every time, laughing at the same parts, watching at the edge of my seat with others, it never gets old for me, it's a pure eighties classic, and one of the few movies that all generations tend to enjoy. The cast is fantastic and one of the most vital parts of making this movie work, they didn't seem like easy characters, particularly Marty and Doc, they have a lot of layers and certain requirements for portraying them accurately, but every actor nails their role, the script has some very funny bits, but also dramatic parts, and the cast succeeds in all areas of acting. The story is quite complicated, it has the concept of time travel involved, thrown in with a complicated love story, as well as a lot of necessary character development, but it manages to perfectly bring all of this together in a movie that isn't even two hours long, and it dosen't manage to feel any bit cluttered or overlong. Memorable lines, historical movie moments, outstanding performances, a beautiful script and stellar directing from the great Robert Zemeckis, I consider Back to the Future to be my favourite movie, I think all moviegoers should see it, it's a must watch. After ending up in the year 1955 through his friend Doctor Emmet Brown's time machine, Marty McFly must make sure his parents get together to ensure his existence after ruining the moment they fell in love. Best Performance: Christopher Llyod Worst Performance: Wendie Jo Sperber"
28.12.2012,8.0,"Back to the future is one movie that contains excellent visual effects, a nice story plot and the directing is just excellent. The movie has a beautiful screenplay, and the movie puts the full stop in the statement, ""never a dull moment.""Michael J Fox was the desired man cast to play the lead role Marty McFly, but he turned it down due to scheduling conflicts, so Eric Soltz was cast in his place. After filming had begun, Zemeckis and Spielberg felt Soltz was not portraying the character well enough and knew this was a casting error, so they had to re-cast and ask Fox to try and make time to be in the movie. So Fox had to re-arrange his schedule time to be able to shoot Family Ties (TV Series) and the movie at the same time, this recasting meant, an extra 3 million production cost, as all the scenes that Eric had done had to be redone and Fox was so busy, that it was said that he only got 5 hours of sleep a day at the time.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager from the Eighties who befriends a slightly coco scientist Doctor Brown (Christopher Lloyd). During one of their meetings Doctor Brown mistakenly (due to an accident) sends Marty 30 years into the past, 1955 to be exact. Marty while in the past, mistakenly interrupts his parents meeting and he must find a way to fix it or else he will no longer exist. He also has to help the Doctor Brown of 1955 get him (Marty) Back to the future.Back to the Future was a financial success the movie's 100 days production cost was 19 million dollars (including the recasting cost) and it made over 380 million dollars in the box office. It was also a critical acclaim winning an Oscar for Best Sounding Editing.The balance in this movie is what makes it a most watch the movie's transgression from comic to science fiction to romance/drama, is what makes it such a most watch, it takes its time to explain even the complexity of time travel, that at the end even with the slightest of details that made no sense I actually was convinced and doubted not that Doctor Brown did it.Back to the Future is a movie hit for all to see and enjoy, it was that good that two sequels were added to it, Back to the Future II and Back to the Future III although the release dates for the sequels were 1989 and 1990 respectively all maintained the time of 1985 when the first time travel happened. So in the end of Back to the Future III, we were back in 1985.www.lagsreviews.com"
09.11.2012,10.0,"""Back to the Future"" good film or astonishing film?""Back to the Future"" is a film loved by many. Specifically, ""Back to the Future"" is exciting and adventurous. Moreover, it has great acting. Subsequently, the series of events was so good they had to make 3 movies to fit the whole plot of the story. ""Back to the Future"" is a brilliant movie.Fundamentally, ""Back to the Future"" is extremely thrilling and venturesome. Presumably, the main characters Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) go back to the future. Accordingly, the main character, Marty McFly, goes to the past in a time machine made out of a DeLorean. Ultimately, he causes a lot of issues and starts to fade away. Significantly, the main attraction that people look for in a good film is the acting. Furthermore, when the director of ""Back to the Future"" ( Robert Zemeckis), hired actors such as Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson and Claudia Wells, you won't get anything less than superior. Additionally, the characters in the movie do not leave in the second and third; each piece to the puzzle overlaps and you'll find characters in the same place that they were left in the very first film. On the other hand, time travel isn't real and is initially impossible. Some may find it childish and absurd. Conversely, isn't that why people watch movies? To get the feeling that they went somewhere else; to feel as if they really preformed the action the character just attempted. ""Back to the Future"" is an adventure like no other and is suspenseful throughout the entire production. Comparatively, most films have an easy plot and the story line is plain yet dull. However, ""Back to the Future"" is not like that at all. To demonstrate, the first movie of the series was spectacular. Initially, it had a great special effects and left you on a cliff hanger in the end when Dr. Emmett Brown says ""roads, we don't need roads"" and the DeLorean takes off into the sky. Henceforth, the characters go through three main settings; The Past, The Future, and The Wild West. The very end of ""Back to the Future"" is astounding and inspirational. Predictably, I would greatly suggest seeing this movie. Therefore, are you into suspenseful adventures? If they are you're thing, I would say that you need to look into seeing ""Back to the Future"". Ultimately, you will not regret it and you certainly will love what you have seen."
21.10.2012,9.0,"Recipe for fun: take one teenaged boy from 1985, a ""mad"" scientist who's obsessed with finally getting his 30-year experiment to work, and a very special Delorean--mix in some family troubles and a complicated love triangle; cut in some quotable dialog; heat it up with plenty of action; remove from the '80s and let cool in the '50s; and top it all with Huey Lewis and the News.There may be one or two people left on the planet who don't know the plot to Back to the Future. Okay: Young Marty is accidentally sent back in Doc Brown's Delorean from 1985 to 1955 and has to contact eccentric Doc's 30-years-younger version to help him get back to the future. (See what I did there? Clever, right?) Marty's biggest challenge is to not change anything in his past that could adversely affect the future -- say, preventing his mom and dad from falling in love, which would jeopardize his very existence. OOops! That's already messed up, so now he must correct the mishap or he'll disappear before he can get back to 1985.Every element of Back to the Future works to create the coolest comedy of its decade. The comic situations that result from Marty trying to play matchmaker to his own parents are very well-played. Of course the best fun comes in when we get to experience (and in some cases, re-experience) the '50s from an '80s perspective. All these good times are helped along by having the easily likable Michael J Fox in the lead and the incomparable Christopher Lloyd as the hyperactive Doc -- a role he was born to play. Unflagging, quotable dialog powers the plot wonderfully.Back to the Future is the kind of movie that can appeal to anybody from ages 10 to 100. When I saw this in the theater in '85 it was an instant hit across all cliques from the nerds to the jocks -- my generation's primer on time travel movies. I remember laughing right along with my mom and my little sisters. Not that many films manage to pull off that kind of magic, then or now."
19.10.2012,7.0,"Since the beginning of time we have wondered, what it would be like to rewind time, and undo those things we either did not intend to do, or to do something we should have done in the past. This could alter our lives, in the present or future as we know it. The movie Back to the Future (1985), allowed me to live this fantasy. Although, the plot was based on a realistic scientific possibility, I know it to be just a fantasy in realization.The plot was Doc Brown, (Christopher Lloyds) creation that a DeLorean could indeed travel through time. However, during a bad transaction that had taken place with the Doc, and some extremists, the Doc was shot and killed, while Marty (Michael J. Fox), the lead character escapes the shootout in the famed Delorean automobile. The car would travel back in time, to 1955, as he was driving away at a heightened rate of speed in the automobile. The thrill of this movie for me begins when Marty travels back in time, and he accidentally gets hit by his grandfather in his own car. He was then taken to his home for care, where his young mother, falls in love with him. This would create a chain reaction, which would prevent his mother and father from ever meeting and would put his own, existence at stake.Throughout this movie his whole mission was to find the old Doc, so he could help him get back to 1985. This strategic maneuvering would ensure that his mother and father met, and inform the Doc about what happens to him in the future, so he could hopefully prevent it. After all this was accomplished the goal was to dodge the character of the story, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), the young man who was head over heels for Marty's mother. Biff wasted no time clobbering Marty every chance he got, in order to make Marty's mother not like Marty, by proving that Marty was a non-worthy wimp. Overall the idea of going back in time was awesome! However, the whole idea of my mother being attracted to me was very creepy. I believe that many of the movie goers would agree with me. Yes, the technological twist, drama and theatrics were great for its time (1985); but the close relationship, between mother and son, was a little over the top for me."
15.10.2012,9.0,"There are though films, that you need to force yourself to pay attention to, before the payoff (the ultimate example being Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev) and there are films that you can simply enjoy effortlessly, such as Back to the Future, one of the best films ever made! Yes, that's right, it surely belongs to the top 100 best films ever, perhaps top 30. I would rank it as among the top 5 comedies ever made and among the top 10 science fiction films ever made as well!Why? It is so freaking good! The 1980's were indeed the peak of pop culture: films and music only got better and better until they peaked in the mid 1980's and this is the peak right now: the coolest film ever made. It is way better than Raider of the Lost Ark in delivering fun!"
10.10.2012,9.0,"""Back to the Future"" is one of my all-time favorite films. It is one that the whole family can sit down and watch, but isn't one of those stupid childish animations that comes under ""family"" but is actually just for kids 2-8. It is one of the few films I never get tired of watching, and by now I must have seen it at least 50 times (no joke!). I've never gotten tired of this film as it is so original in the way it is presented. I've never seen another film where a DeLorean is a time machine, or one where a son is hit on by his mother for that matter... Anyway, this film is timeless, as it is so funny, clever, and you never know what is coming round the corner. The film is based in 1955, although it does start off in 1985. Marty McFly, one of the main characters, travels back in time and runs into his parents (George and Loraine), which starts off the whole story, involving a time machine, some messing with history, and pretty awesome music. This film is brilliant and gets an easy 9/10 from me!"
05.09.2012,8.0,When I first looked at this movie I was hesitant because I was not into classics at the time. I actually found myself surprised that I actually liked the film. I did find a few flaws in it but they were pretty minor. The script was solid; The acting was right on point; the characters were very well thought out and the storyline was very rich. Now I will say that this film could have used a little improvement but other then that it was very entertaining. To be honest I am not a very big fan of time traveling films but this one caught me by surprise. Not a perfect film but no film is. Anyone who is a fan of classics should give Back to the future a try. 8/10
06.08.2012,10.0,"This movie was my very first movie I have ever bought. I remember seeing previews for this movie when it came out in theaters. The line that was shot from the trailer was when Lorraine said, ""Isn't he a dream boat"". Til this day, I can watch this movie over and over again and I can say the next line. That is how well I know this movie. I would love to write the novel for this movie. That would be very interesting. The other two were also gems. Have all of them. Michael J. Fox is a great actor and can play it so well. I recommend this movie to every family out there who has children. My son also loves the trilogy movie of Back to the Future."
03.08.2012,10.0,"Back to the Future is just one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen every time you flip by it when channel surfing you always stop on that channel and watch it again. I've probably seen this movie a 100 times since I was a kid but if I stop on HBO and its playing I just can't help but at least watch a few minutes of it before returning to my channel surfing.Michael J. Fox was the absolute best actor to choose to star in this movie, he has great screen presence that whenever he's on TV he grabs your attention. It's such a shame the health problems he has had that such great skills are going to waste.The movie has so many great lines that I still quote to this day."
03.07.2012,9.0,"This will be my very first review. A review I've been going over in my mind for almost 30 years. That is how long I have been considering this movie as my absolute favorite one. So emotion is involved, but that is always the case when you talk about art. Because that is what this movie is; a work of art. It is the perfect blend of all ingredients a movie needs.
I rate it 9 though, because I don't think anything can be a 10."
17.06.2012,9.0,"Before Robert Zemekis had Forrest Gump teaching Elvis how to dance, he had young Marty McFly inventing Rock and Roll for Chuck Berry. A classic time travel original full of light romance, sci-fi action, and good humor, even if a bit too much salty language. The supporting cast is perfectly raptured in their stereotypical high school roles and the revisiting the of 1950's is just precious. Oh, there's also Christopher Lloyd interrupting the terminal cuteness of Michael J. Fox. It's that combination that revolves around a tightly written screenplay which carries endless plot reference not to be missed. Full of ""what could go wrong"" only trumped only by ""what else can go wrong?"" Great Scott!"
10.06.2012,10.0,"If you cut this movie in half you'd see the word ""Quality"" stamped right through it!!Drove my parents mad as a kid watching this over and over again, and all these years later I now get to drive my wife mad with the whole trilogy.Possibly one of the best time travel movies that you'll ever see, even with the lack of special effects that you might expect to see if it were made today... It's simplicity is what makes it compulsive viewing.Enjoy!!"
28.04.2012,10.0,"How many movies can you honestly say you would never get tired of seeing? Most movies, no matter how notably excellent they may be, lose at least a little bit of their charm, their ability to thrill, when you've seen them a number of times. Back to the Future is one of those precious few movies for which the thrill is never gone. There's so much here. Action, adventure, humor, drama, romance. The story is fabulous. The performances are fabulous. The music is fabulous. Great characters, great dialogue, great effects. Pretty much great everything. And even if you know the movie by heart, and at this point I pretty much do, it doesn't get old. Not a bit. I'll go back in time with Marty McFly over and over again. What a fabulous journey Marty goes on. Lucky are we who are along for the ride.The story is wonderfully simple and yet incredibly intricate. Teenager Marty McFly is sent back in time, from 1985 to 1955. In 1955 the most beautiful girl you'll ever see falls for Marty. Lorraine Baines is the dream girl any guy would fall in love with...if she weren't his mother. Yes, Marty's mom now has the hots for him instead of his father. Marty has prevented his parents from falling in love. If he doesn't fix that he will be erased from existence. Of course there is also the small matter of getting back to 1985. Thankfully Marty has a friend in 1955 who can help, Doc Brown. Marty and Doc, one of the great pairings in movie history.The movie starts a little slowly as it sets itself up. But then Marty and Doc come together in that shopping mall parking lot and the magic begins. From the moment Marty hops into that DeLorean and revs it up to 88 this movie is sheer perfection. Michael J. Fox, playing Marty, is obviously the glue holding the whole thing together and he is magnificent. But Christopher Lloyd, playing Doc, may be most indispensable of all. Could there be any other Doc Brown? With gestures and reactions and facial expressions Lloyd brought this character to life in a way nobody else could. He can say it all without saying a word. Of course when he does say something that's memorable too. 1.21 gigawatts! If having the kooky Lloyd playing the exceedingly kooky Doc Brown weren't enough we also get Crispin Glover playing Marty's father George. Or would-be father once Marty screws things up. Glover is a performer quite unlike any other and he makes George his own. What a fabulous job he did. Thomas F. Wilson makes for a great villain with Biff, hated in two generations. And Lea Thompson as Lorraine? Now that's a girl worth getting run over by a car for. Thompson certainly looks the part of the dream girl but she proves to be much more than just a pretty face. Her performance is perfect. The sweet, innocent 1950s girl. Or is she really that innocent?This is a story which had to be worked out meticulously and it was. Any missteps unravel everything. But at heart it's still rather simple which makes the story, and the characters, so easy to embrace. Director Robert Zemeckis tied it all together brilliantly. The story, the characters, the actors...it was a perfect storm which came together to produce true movie magic. This is a movie which is not just enjoyed, it is beloved. And it should be. What's your favorite Back to the Future moment? Is it one that makes you laugh? One that makes you cheer? Or one that makes you want to get up and dance? Go, go! Go Johnny go! Yeah, even the music in this movie is perfect as Marty desperately tries to get back to 1985. Ah yes, 1985, that glorious moment in time where if you wanted to put a really cool rock star in your movie you went out and got Huey Lewis. Everybody, Huey included, plays their part in this glorious movie. By the time the end comes, with one of the greatest closing lines in movie history because this movie is perfect right to the end, you want to stand and cheer. No matter how many times you've seen it. No matter if you're all by yourself in your living room. Stand. Cheer. You know you want to. And this movie deserves it."
22.02.2012,9.0,"Back To The Future was a film I grew up on. It is one of those that I always remember watching as a child and one that never failed to entertain me. I was completely shocked however when I watched it recently and couldn't remember most of it. That being said I was right in remembering one thing, it is a damn great film.This is one of the only roles I really remember Michael J. Fox doing. Here he play Marty McFly, an iconic name to many out there today. He is a typical teenager, running late for school, eyeing up the girls and hating his family life. His father is a wimp, who is bullied by his boss, Biff and his mother is an alcoholic. His siblings also hold down poor jobs and aren't particularly lookers. Due to this Marty chooses to spend his time with Doc (Lloyd), a mad scientist who is planning an experiment at a shopping mall car park in the middle of the night and needs Marty's help to film it. The experiment is to do with Doc's latest invention, a time travelling DeLorean, much to Marty's shock and amusement. However during the experiment a group of Libyan terrorists barge in and shoot Doc for stealing their plutonium. Marty jumps into the DeLorean and drives at speed to get away but ends up blasting thirty years into the past.Once in the past Marty comes across his parents, and accidentally prevents them from meeting, meaning his own existence would eventually cease to exist. He enables the help of the younger Doc who sets out on finding a way to get Marty back to the future whilst he must find a way to make his parents meet and have that all important first kiss.The premise is fairly simple but has a lot of depth, the writing is just brilliant. The film drops in hints all over of everything that is going to happen. The opening ten minutes alone references the past constantly and ultimately sets us up for what is about to happen. Everything is sewn together at the end also and nothing is left loose, except for of course the very end but you will see for yourselves. All tiny plot lines are relevant and everything that is said has huge relevance, even the repetition of dialogue which mimics the characters in different eras of their lives. The dialogue at times is great and there is a fantastic reference to Star Wars and Star Trek. The writing, and the direction are a large reason to the great success of the film.The acting is also a big reason. Fox is great as the teenager we all will on to win. He is a character we can all relate to and all want to be. Right from the offset we want Marty McFly to succeed. Christopher Lloyd is also great, it is as if the role was specifically designed for him. He plays the crazy scientist with ease and he is a lovable character despite his tendencies to do the wrong thing. Marty's parents (Thompson and Glover) are excellent, Glover maybe more so. They both portray the elder parents and the teenage versions of themselves as if they are the age of the role they are playing. In fact they are the same age as Fox and were cast based around the story in the past and made up for the story in the future. Glover is just brilliant as the bumbling nerd and the hair style just works on Glover and Glover alone. We also get a bully in Biff, played by Thomas F. Wilson, who is also so pivotal. The acting for Biff is also top drawer and you really do hate him.The film has everything; humour, action, family fun, love, you name it, it has got it: even the creepy thunder storm and lightning strike. It will please any sort of movie fan whether it be the typical movie buff or the guy who only tunes in every now and again. It is a film not to be missed.My slight negative about it though is the relationship between Doc and Marty within the past. In the present we really believe they are friends but they don't spend too much screen time together in the past and I didn't quite believe that they were going to 'miss' each other like they said they would. I would possibly have liked to have seen a few more minutes of them two together. Maybe that is just me but it is my only negative with the film.I understand that this will probably make little sense. The referencing to past, present and future within this review is confusing. One thing I have thought about though is this: surely if you are watching the film Marty is always in the present? If there is a continuing time line on a constant loop will you ever be in the past or future? Wouldn't you just always be in your present? Just one to think about but do it before or after the film as it is one you just need to kick back with and enjoy.4.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"
02.02.2012,10.0,"Back to the Future is one of the time travel movies that does things right. The story of the film is basically Marty Mcfly(played by Michael J.Fox) is living in 1985 and his friend Doc Brown(played by Christopher Lloyd) ,who is a mad scientist shows off his new invention: the time machine. Something crazy happens that causes Marty to go back to 1955 in Doc's time machine and is stuck in 1955, and to make matters worse, the time machine is broken! On top of that, he stupidly alters his future and prevents HIS OWN BIRTH! Crazy huh? But, its up to Marty and Doc(played by Christopher Lloyd) to not only get Marty back to his present time, but to also fix the wrongs he has caused to his future! I will not spoil this movie because you must go see this magnificent piece of film-making! The performances in this movie were all fantastic! Especially the best villain in that movie: Biff. He is a mean bully that picks on everyone and has the most hilarious lines in this movie!""Well look at what we have here."" Robert Zemeckis did a superb job in establishing the characters and the plot-line.Not to mention, its a blend of other genres besides time-travel. There is romance, high school, sci-fi and action all in one movie!WOW! Hoow did they manage to do that you may ask? Well, it just works because the script cleverly sets the movie up. Plus, the story runs very smoothly during transitions of scenes. Usually, when time travel is involved as a premise to a story, it would fall completely apart. But, thankfully they didn't do that! The story is actually not as complicated as people think. But, it does make your head spin of all the things going on in the movie! Its very consistent on switching to those scenes. Plus, the special effects were jaw-dropping back in the 80's but today it kind of looks outdated. However, this film has a charm that makes this film a spectacle in the time-travel genre. Now, what I liked about this film was the way the story was presented and the hilarious interactions between the characters:""Oh what are you looking at butt head?"" Oh and the special effects! ""If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 mph, you're gonna see some serious s**t!"" See I'm already quoting the movie, thats how good it is! That line always makes me think of BTF so much! But anyway, there is really nothing wrong with this film. Now, its not my favorite of the series.(OMG HOW DARE HE! HOW DARE HE SAY BTF IS NOT HIS FAVORITE!!!! TROLOLOLOLOLOLOOLOLOLOLLOL) Yes, it is not my favorite IN MY OPINION! However, this is a fantastic piece of work from Robert Zemeckis! As Doc Brown says:""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" I have lived with that quote in my head in my entire life to never give up on what you fight for! Overall, I think this is a fantastic film in the time-travel genre and deserves to be on the IMDb Top 250 List! ""So, why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here!"""
24.01.2012,9.0,"This movie is magnificent. The directing and actor are superb. originally director Robert Zemeckis had chosen Eric Stoltz to play the part of Marty McFly and I think we're all glad that he then chose Michael J. Fox to play Marty instead. This movie really makes you pay attention to detail and takes you into the realization that Marty is hanging out with his parents when they were kids, and they play off that whole not fitting in with the time with his clothes and making the film funny by talking about him, his family, and the future. This movie shows something that everyone wants to do in their lifetime, which is time travel and this is a great way to show it. Back to the Future is definitely a movie that will never get old and will always be enjoyable."
27.12.2011,8.0,"About once a decade a film emerges that is so original and new that it immediately raises the bar for the rest of mainstream cinema to aspire to, films that are both critically espoused and well supported at the box office.The 70s brought us Star Wars and The Godfather (1 & 2), the 90s The Matrix, Toy Story and The Sixth Sense gave us the 'big twist' ending (for better or worse), the dubbos The Lord of the Rings trilogy (seriously, how many times has it been ripped off already?) and perhaps Avatar, and this decade so far has Inception, which although flawed is an admirable attempt at breaking the mould and creating something distinctly original.The 80s was all about the adventure (Indiana Jones), Blade Runner must be mentioned and the introduction of the macho action hero (Arnie, Bruce, Sly) but at equal 4th on the IMDb Top Ranked 80s titles is a 'little' film called Back to the Future, it didn't need big explosions, huge car chases and thousands of rounds of ammunition, just a creative plot and some likable characters to inhabit it.And really that's the entire Back to the Future (BttF) trilogy in a nutshell. The films don't have a huge number of jokes, the action is OK but not mind blowing and there is essentially zero sex and violence. What it does exude in abundance is charm, charm which starts with the most likable 5 foot tall guy of the 80s and 90s, Mr Michael J Fox.Fox plays Marty McFly, a typical 80s 'teen' from Hill Valley obsessed with girls (namely his girlfriend Jennifer), skateboards and music. His family are also typical and loving, his Dad (Crispin Glover) is a nervous and timid wallflower and his Mum is slightly strict but well meaning. The entire family – especially Dad – is pushed around by a local moron named Biff who has tortured him since school age.To blow off steam McFly has a friendship with a local eccentric scientist named Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc's dabbles in everything scientific and has hundreds of wonderful inventions, none of which have set the world on fire.But all of that is about to change.Doc's latest creation is a time traveling car (a DeLoreon to be specific) that when gunned to 88mph can FF or rewind to any pre-programmed point in history. McFly is dubious but he agrees at the insistence of Doc Brown to show up at an early morning (actually late evening) trial run in a supermarket car park.Using Doc's dog Einstein as the test pilot they give the car a try, and lo and behold the thing actually works! But before they even have a chance to high five and discuss how this new invention will benefit the world Libyan terrorists unexpectedly show up and gun down the Doc, with McFly only just managing to escape in the DeLorean.This one act sets in chain a series of incredible and intricately plotted events that span 3 centuries and several generations of McFly's (and 'Biff's' for that matter) Marty initially is transported back to 1985 where he is hopelessly out of place. While there he manages to meet his two parents before they even have a chance to get together, his actions inadvertently prevent this from happening, meaning that he must somehow play matchmaker to his own folks else he remove himself from existence altogether.There's a whole lot more to the original BttF, aside from literally justifying his own existence Marty manages to invent skateboarding and rock 'n' roll in his limited stay in 1955, all the while striving to avoid actions that somehow alter the future along the way.I obviously can't go into too much detail but the ending was excellent as well.Now some 25 years later time travel in films is commonplace – even Red Dwarf and Futurama have produced excellent episodes dealing with time travel paradoxes – and yes I know about The Time Machine and the 'classic' older films dealing with the topic (that I can't name). Back to the Future managed to take a science fiction core and make it interesting to the everyday movie watcher who just wants to be entertained for a couple hours (I am trying to say 'non-geeks'), the original BttF was/and is immensely original and creative, with solid performances plural by Michael J Fox as, well many McFly's.It isn't laugh a minute or gasp inducing but you'll go a long while before you find a mainstream film this innovative and enjoyable, and the sequel was even better! Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. Somehow I admire the 2nd film more, but without the elaborate set-ups structured in this film that wouldn't be near as effective, and this film is effortlessly entertaining in any case."
12.12.2011,8.0,"I haven't seen this movie in 27 years. I decided to watch it again after playing Back to the Future: The Game, which made me nostalgic.As I remembered, it's a funny, entertaining, ingenious movie that never flags. But what I could appreciate now, since even after 27 years I remembered the story remarkably well, was how nicely constructed the movie was. Nothing in it feels like a coincidence, or like a stretch. Everything is put in place. Everything Marty needs is there, but there's a good reason. Every crazy event follows a logical chain of circumstances. The movie is not simply wonderfully filmed but wonderfully designed, an example of a movie where everything has been thought out and nothing fudged. Sure, the story has the sort of time travel conundrums that make all time travel movies susceptible to criticism for being ultimately impossible, but if you accept the basic sci-fi premises, everything else makes perfect sense.If you've never seen it, watch it just for the entertainment. If you've seen it before, watch it again just to notice how nicely put together it is."
02.12.2011,9.0,"There are always decade-defining films. They may not be the best films of the decade, but they capture the feel of living in them. Back to the Future IS the 80's. It's funny, charming, sweet, and completely enjoyable. Dare, I say, it's one of the most enjoyable films ever made.There had to be a point during the writing process when someone said, ""This is it."" The plot is movie magic. Teenager goes back in time to save his future by fixing the past of his parents? Brilliant! And it works so well because of the phenomenal, tightly written script. All the little things are important and all tie together. It's so cool to see the same scene happen in two time periods, but the action is exactly the same. Like the diner with Biff/ Marty's house with Biff. It's laugh out loud funny, with plenty of period gags (Reagan, who the hell is John F. Kennedy?), and sweet, with goodbyes and relationships that clearly inspired modern film and TV (Lost Season 5?). The pacing is perfect, with a constant sense of movement, and Zemeckis can weave suspense whenever he wants, be it the first 88 mph or the super- tense climax.In this cartoon world are cartoon characters, and Back to the Future is filled with gems. Marty McFly, one of the most iconic teenagers,is pure charisma. ""That's heavy stuff!"" We wish we were Marty. He's too cool. Doc Brown, with his great phrases and even better facial expressions, is just so dang lovable. And the first time I saw this, I completely overlooked George McFly. He is hilarious. Brilliantly pathetic.It's impossible to not like Back to the Future. Sometimes it crosses the line into cheesy (NOOOOO!), the CG looks fake in some places, and personally I don't like the role reversal of George and Biff at the end (he became what we hated in the beginning), but those are small things. Back to the Future is one of the best 80's movies, and has undeniable charm. You have to see this one. 9.3/10"
26.10.2011,,"Today isn't the anniversary of the release of this movie (that was back in July) but today is the twenty-sixth anniversary of the day Marty McFly went back time in it which makes it the same number anniversary as this date! So keep in mind all the glory and powerful image this story has evoked for everyone over the years since 1985 and the further impact it will have for generations to come. You know I'm a child of the 1980's and think that this was an awesome decade in which to grow up. While of course every time period has it's ways for being defined this way I hope that all you out there will take a chance to view the particular attributes the 1980's had for shaping society and try to notice the positive impact and images you can make out of them. I mean it took things like friendship, love, warm feeling, innocence, and even comic relief and mysticism very profoundly and emphasized that anything can have some form of bright side, and that every possibility is endless! These movies with a new generation in special effects (which was as I've heard launched by Star Wars in 1977) began about 1980, or to a more exact point 1982 with the theater release of E.T. (the first movie I saw on the big screen) and continued for the rest of the decade which went well given that it was just in time for the positive image as described above. One thing I know is that for the rest of my life I'll be in the process of keeping this era alive as much as I can, and showing the world what an extraordinary icon every member of society can make of themselves and the world around them. Transcendence is the key as outlined in these many incredible pictures and pop culture icons (and countless other forms) of the 1980's to making the world a better place and the limitless potential that everyone and everything possesses shine!"
17.10.2011,,"This time travel turkey has all the adventure of a snail with motor neurons disease. I can't believe people would find this entertaining. And what's with that car? how can a Delorean be a time machine given its spacial design? And if you can stomach th performance by George Dichcenzo who play Marty's grandfather, then your up for some kind of endurance trophy. Marty should have been sent back to biblical times so that he can be lynched and put to death on the cross. It is an utter waste of talent that director Robert zemeckis should have involved himself with this crud not once but three times. Thank god he redeemed himself later with 'death becomes her'."
13.10.2011,10.0,"One of the most entertaining science fiction movies of all time, since ""E.T."" and ""Star Wars"". ""Back to the Future"" tells the story of Marty McFly, who accidentally gets transported into a time machine, built by a wacko-genius scientist named Dr. Emmett Brown, and accidentally gets sent into 1955, and interacts with his parents as teenagers. Know he must get his teen parents together before the space-time continuum can mean the end of the world, and he must get back home to 1985 quickly. Now, I'm a big fan of science fiction, and this movie is a gigantic time-travel masterpiece. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd both lead an all-star cast with incredible and hilarious performances. The cast also includes the many great performances of Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and Crispin Glover. Robert Zemeckis does an amazing job of putting the movie together, and he joins Bob Gale in writing a well-written tribute to science fiction. The sound is super and superb, the visual effects are groundbreaking, the cast is incredible, the soundtrack is awesome, the score is amazing, the characters are well-memorable, and everything about this movie makes me wait for more, and I'm always entertained by this movie, even when watching over and over again. ""Back to the Future"" is science-fiction genius, and it's one of the many groundbreaking cinematic achievements in history. ""Back to the Future"", in my review, ""an incredible science-fiction tale, filled with entertainment to enjoy""."
03.10.2011,10.0,"Back to the Future is the one the best movie I've seen in my entire life! The main reason I liked it was the plot, characters, well everything! I won't reveal it since it's not fair to some people that have never seen it. For first timers: I guarantee you will not regret watching it and will want to see it, over and over again! Even though it's been 25 years since they released it, the classic never died. Every time I watch it, the movie still feels like new! I once heard a rumor they may do a remake and they might use Bieber as Marty McFly (I pray to god he won't be in it!!). I don't want to see a remake happening, not just Bieber, because it destroys the classic. But that's just my opinion."
29.08.2011,9.0,"Back to the Future' is Absolute Entertainment! An engaging, funny, lively & arresting film, that, in many ways, is Time-Less! Easily, Amongst The Finest Science-Fiction/Adventure films to date.'Back to the Future' tells the story of Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955. He meets his future parents in high school and accidentally attracts his future mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents-to-be to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, he must find a way to return to 1985. A Terrific idea, translates into a Terrific Film. Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale's Screenplay is so engaging, lively & fast-paced, that, it holds your attention from start to end. Also, the entire track of the bad guy Biff, is superbly handled. Zemeckis Directs this Terrific Film, with style. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is razor-sharp. Art Design is fantastic. Special Effects are neat. Performance-Wise: Michael J. Fox immortalizes Marty McFly, with his impeccable performance in here. The Immensely Talented Actor looks the part to the T, and is lovable throughout. Christopher Lloyd plays Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, remarkably. Crispin Glover is outstanding as George McFly. Lea Thompson as Lorraine Baines McFly, is very good. Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, is convincing.On the whole, 'Back to the Future' rocks! A Highly-Entertaining Film, that shouldn't be missed by cinema fans. Two Thumbs Up!"
27.07.2011,8.0,"I see Back to the Future has grossed $350 million. I wonder how much it would have made if I had directed it?While Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd deliver impeccable performances, and it is impossible to imagine the movie without them, most of the rest of the acting is pretty bad, sometimes way, way over the top, such as the 1985 revised apologetic Biff. Anywhere else, audiences would have cringed. I cringe every time I see it.But you can't argue with success. Did the movie succeed because of the over-acting, or despite it? Perhaps teenagers were amused by the silliness. But for adults, the movie is strong enough that they seemingly overlook it.Back to the Future has many strengths, such as drawing you into the fantasy of what it would be like to travel back to the 1950s. There is enough detail and authenticity to the recreation that you are able to imagine you have gone back in time with the movie. I like movies that get young people interested in understanding what it was like before they were born. Yet, if you are going to go through all the trouble of recreating the 1950s, the time-travel fantasy effect would work better if the acting were more believable. On the other hand, they overdo the sin-city decay of the 1985 present, for a small American town/city. There are some echoes of Bedford Falls without George Bailey, from It's a Wonderful Life (which would make a nice companion viewing). And speaking of connections, I believe this is the same town set used in Harvey with James Stewart, and for Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (?).The bottom line is Back to the Future starts with a cute concept and gives it several layers of action and irony that keep you amused. It succeeds in the rare accomplishment for a comedy of working just about as effectively upon subsequent viewings. This is because the humor is not based on crude jokes or bad language, but on the manipulation of the tension in the awkward, off-balance relationships between the characters. Part of the genius of this film is the way these awkward relationships are resolved to the audience's immense satisfaction.These strengths are why I still enjoy this film, despite the over- acting. But producer Steven Spielberg is certainly no fool, especially when it comes to hitting the bulls-eye with younger viewers. So I must assume this is what he was aiming for. What do you think?"
24.07.2011,9.0,"Marty McFly's first ride is still every bit as charming and entertaining as ever, although the soundtrack seems to get more dated every time I hear it - I caught no less than five different instances of ""Power of Love"" in the first ten minutes of screen time. Despite the inherent plot issues involved with any time travel film, this is still a great adventure with a diverse, likable cast and career-defining performances from Christopher Lloyd, Michael J Fox and Crispin Glover. Even though I could recite several lines verbatim from the dark recesses of my memory, I still caught myself laughing at the jokes like they were brand new, and grinning like a fool from start to finish. Like many high profile BR discs, the picture on this was almost *too* stunning - you can actually see some of the ""old person"" makeup flaking off around certain characters' necks in the '80s scenes. A few early moments are excessively grainy, but once the plot gets moving, that clears up for good."
02.06.2011,8.0,"Marty, a young slacker is sent 30 years back in time, and now has to worry about not only returning, but not changing events that have already happened, including that his parents met and fell in love. Whilst this is rather 80's(and granted, that has a charm of its own... it can, however, also be really off-putting), it does stand up well enough, with few jokes and gags having aged poorly. ...is one of those bullies seriously wearing 3-D glasses? The characters tend to be well-done, if there are some really obvious stereotypes(but it seems intentional). Humor works pretty well, if it can be really silly and goofy at times. The dialog is good, some really memorable lines. You always understand the ""science"" aspect, without a lot of wordy explanations, and there is no technobabble. The music is catchy. Acting is great, other than some over the top performances(again, they didn't happen by accident). It's a fun, rewatchable High School comedy flick with time-travel. The climax is also surprisingly tense, for how predictable parts of this can be. I recommend this to any fan of the decade, the cast and the concept itself. 8/10"
10.02.2011,10.0,One of the best movies ever i have many dreams to make this movie come true i wish to have time machine to change the future maybe i can make it better place this movie have changed me i wish this movie to be re predeceased in new graphic and new special effects or to be new series who can imagine that boy can turn back in time and meet his mother or be closed to marry her this is great seen when he helped his father to marry his mother and when hiss uncle duck helped him to get enough power to turn the car engine every body wont to get the same opportunity to change the past to have better future and help his family to have better life also the seen of his car broken and his uncle get back with his flying train to show him that he have better life and changed his own future this was amazing and really helped to have better understanding of my future and make me know that today that makes tomorrow and every day create your history
05.02.2011,10.0,"Robert Zemeckis' Back To The Future is a highly entertaining, well imagined classic of a blockbuster. The 80's spawned a rich variety of franchise films and the Back To The Future series can be considered one of the better ones. Central to the success of the film are the performances, this is a science fiction blockbuster relatively light on special effects and more concerned with character and plot. All the actors are great, Lloyd and Fox of course,but praise must also go to Crispin Glover who plays his wet blanketed nerd with a heart role to perfection. The script is sharp and the production design is outstanding with a picture postcard image of the 1950's well realised and the Deloreon time machine a great touch. Zemeckis' last film Romance In The Stone proved how well he could handle entertaining popcorn movies and he succeeds beyond expectation here with a highly energised, fun packed time travelling adventure to remember."
20.01.2011,10.0,"(This is my First review on IMDb. I had to write it for the sake of humanity and space-time continuum ;)Theme & Genre: The first thing which strikes me in BTTF is the theme, which is by far the most puzzled idea ever conceived by human mind - ""Time Travel"". Every true science fiction fan (or for anybody for that matter) have always wondered, if he could change the past. What if he could visit the past and see what was it like to meet your parents when they were your age? Its a truly wonderful idea, and with all its anomalies and paradoxes, still never fails to amaze the audience with the possibilities. In Particular, BTTF cant be put into just one Genre. Due to Time travel, its Sci-Fi, but its comedy, Romantic, as well as, a thriller, with many hair raising experience. The beauty of BTTF is the combination of all these genre with an awesome fusion, without overdoing anything.Story: The most important thing for a movie after the theme is its story. And it hasn't been compromised. BTTF part 1 has an exceptional story line, which only becomes more interesting in subsequent parts. Because of the time travel theme, you get to again witness a plot in part 2, that already had been happened in part1, which is why time travel is interesting, in the first place. (Even writing about it now, is giving me goosebumps.)Effects: Imagine at a time sans GUI OS (Like Windows), how can you imagine the creation of a 3D holographic shark coming out at you, or a flying hover board, or a flying De-Lorean in the midst of air traffic... I could go on, but you got the point..Music: Don't even get me start on this. But I want to :) The music is nothing short of epic. The grand nature of music, just compliment the grand nature of the plots. Romantic song, ""Power of Love"", a more superb romantic song ""Earth Angel"", the groovy ""Back In Time"".. and then the BTTF score by, the Outatime Orchestra, makes me feel like I am a part of something big, a part of the movie itself.Conclusion: Well, everyone have a different taste, but I am talking about the movie, who have a fan base of more than half a million on a Facebook page alone. (as of the time at writing this review). A movie which has been released on Blue Ray on its 25th Anniversary, along with re-release in select theaters, and a movie which has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry! A movie which is timeless, which never gets old, no matter how many times you see it, that is, you had to had a taste in Sci-Fi though.And to say, its just a movie which is ""25"" yrs old! For some, its more than a movie, its a genre in itself."
11.01.2011,10.0,"This is movie magic at its finest.This movie is is fun, funny, captivating, enthralling, suspenseful and all around amazing.Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox are perfect in this movie, and the supporting cast are spectacular as well. Huge shout out to Tom Wilson who plays Biff as well, for being the best movie bully of all time.Now, this film- while being the best thing ever made- ever- is not without its flaws... the opening amp sequence is a bit goofy and out of character with the rest of the film, and Crispen Glover's performance may be too outlandish for some people (personally, I love him in this movie).I'm not sure that this movie is going to stand the test of time- You may have had to live through the 80s to fully appreciate the contrasting attitudes and behaviors of Marty and the people of 1955. I think the film holds up fine right now, but I wonder in 20 years if people will still appreciate its subtleties. In brief, this movie is the most fun thing I've ever watched. Perfect, happy, blissful escapism. Movie magic. Pure movie magic."
15.12.2010,7.0,"Anybody who hates this movie probably hates babies and laughs at people when they're a few dollars short at the grocery store as they're picking through their groceries to see what they can put back until they get a little more money. What else could be said to sell Back to the Future in a review? It's an 80s movie but it's really timeless, winding up as a 50s period piece as much as anything else. Flux capacitor's owe their success to Doc, and 88 miles as hour became forever a part of American folklore. If you haven't seen this movie you need to. It's not a piece of art, or a script with many layers of emotional discovery, but it's a fun movie and is something that can be re-watched time and again. Rating 30/40"
09.12.2010,10.0,"After watching a horrible movie (I don't like to mention the name of that movie!), i saw (or enjoyed to be exact) this flick, and it completely changed my mood. It made me laugh and sustained the laughter throughout the film. Further, it made me watch the other two sequels, consecutively, and i completely enjoyed all the three parts!The storyline is bizarre and different, and it gives enough room for the humor quotient to fill in. Writers Bob Gale and Robert Zemicks, have made sure that the film goes on at a brisk pace. The entire film makes u laugh, and enjoy thoroughly. Speaking about the performances, Michael J. Fox, fits into the character of Marty like a 't'. His perplexed expressions are quite funny to watch, and tickles u. His confused looks, especially in the scene where his mother (in 1955), is about to fall in love for him, and the way he tries to dodge and escape her, deserve special mention. Christopher Lloyd is the man to watch out for; it is his body-language and performance which contribute to the humor factor mostly. His dialog-delivery, body- language, looks and expressions are sure to make you laugh!The Background score by Alen Silvestri, is pretty apt, and especially in the climax scene, his background score maintains the pace of the film and keeps you engaging. In a nut-shell, if you seek for complete enjoyment, and want to ache your own stomach, laughing, then Back to the future, is the one to go for!!!"
25.11.2010,,"25 years on, and back to the future is still seen as one of the best films to ever exist. And i completely agree, because this film is a masterpiece - yes i said it a MASTERPIECE!!! so is it as good as everyone says, oh undeniably , but just what makes it so dam good? well they have that catchy and nostalgic theme tune that just brings a smile on my face every time i hear it. They have the wonderful duo of Christopher Lloyd and Micheal J. Fox who are just hilarious together on screen, and then of course is the story.To keep this really short and not spoil anything for those who have not (and should) seen this, the story is about a Young teenager Marty Mcfly ( Micheal J. Fox), who accidentally gets sent back to the past in the year 1955. he travels back in time in a delorean invented by the brilliant Doc Brown ( Christopher Lloyd). Marty must somehow find a way to get back to the year 1985 and try not to change the past for the worst. that is all i am willing to say because this really is a film you must see without not knowing whats going to happen.I think my 2 favourite characters have to be the villain of the movie Biff ( played to perfection by Thomas F. Wilson) and Lorraine Baines ( played by the beautiful Lea Thompson). I Love Biff just because of how big a prick he can be but still funny and charming at the same time. I can guarantee that once you have seen this movie Biff Tannen will be on your personal list of favourite bad guys , because he's high up on the list on mine . I also love the innocent and sweet Lorraine Baines because.......well, because shes so gorgeous , absolutely stunning. i really like the character but in all honesty, iv always had a thing for Lea Thompson so thats probably why i like that character so god dam much haha.So if you are unfortunate enough to have not seen this epic masterpiece then i advise you do. Robert Zemicks and Steven Spielberg have created a franchise that leaves a warm and happy feeling in the hearts of the viewers, which never leaves. The sequels are both just as good , as back to the future isn't just the perfect movie, its the perfect first chapter, to a perfect trilogy.By Scott Dewhurst"
20.11.2010,10.0,"My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack.A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids of their own, theirs will too. And theirs, and theirs, and theirs..."
06.11.2010,,"After viewing all 3 (and I still love them after all these years) it's just so obvious the franchise is every bit as ""alive"" as the time circuitry and flux capacitor although Marty McFly of course for all the right storyline reasons pronounces it ""dead.""I hope Spielberg/Zemeckis decides to leave the property, all possible licenses to continue the story -very dead. But although most fans disagree with me, I totally of am the strong opinion Zemeckis/Gale highlighted the (in joke of in jokes) ""broken"" flux capacitor that well, isn't really dead but yes, broken but ... har har.. in any future sequels ...even more quirky when used with the wholly intact Mr. Fusion. Remember - Mr. Fusion operates the time circuitry and flux capacitor. The mode of transportation is of no consequence. Only that ""it"" achieves 88 mph. It's my personal wish that this series ends. But the 80s are now our current ""Happy Days/Wonder Years/That 70s Show."" Will they cash in for that reason and a few others? Without including Michael J. Fox and I just don't see how that's possible given his condition, just leave it an 80s American cultural icon. Anyone selling a DeLorean cheap?"
01.11.2010,10.0,"Back in the decade of 'In space no-one can hear you scream', Lightsaber swashbuckling Jedi and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger cradling that not so delicate pump-action, bad-ass necessity; it seemed only appropriate to throw time travel in the mix of a genre that was starting to expand more and more with some good ol' computer technology, which back then, didn't have to become the primary tool in a directors box of apparatus.So when Back to the Future spurted the fiery paths of tire grinding, followed by a once handsome DeLorean turned four wheeled ice block, the questioned was: what made it so much different, better, cooler? Simply, whereas other sci-fi's that demonstrated so effortlessly the compulsive need to slap audiences jaw drop levels further down to the ground, explosion by explosion, Back to the Future arguably took a more humour through simplicity approach.Example, body language. Nothing that will be spoilt of course, but the deliberate motions of characters (especially in the diner) can tell an audience all they'd need to know about a character, before their identity was fully revealed through this interaction. Funny, yes. But not till it scratches the surface more deeply do things start to get more than standard slapstick, especially where family is concerned.That doesn't mean the film lacked, an albeit Michael Bay need for some wanted explosions and top techno talk to remind us throughout it was a sci-fi (""1.21 gigawatts? 1.21 gigawatts? Great Scott!""), and hadn't took the 'Humour of his mum fancying him' path too far and sloppily. If anything, science is more of a focus than anything else.Not for the obvious fact it's a science fiction (Bravo) but more that Marty is as confused with 'Docs' long winded trails of scientific calculations with himself as we are. And ironically, he understands the ins and outs so easily his madness seems ordinary. It's all Marty's dumbfound confusion and the audiences comfort of knowing 'We never need to know what on earth a Flux Capacitor is so let's go along with it'. This all makes the baffling intellect more of a reassurance everything will work, rather than a panicky and frantic turn of heads to understand every little detail as to not get lost in its 'family friendly' plot. And that's what it's all about. It never needs to go into drawn out explanations that only scientific universities would host, it's a thrill ride, Marty's ride, our ride; with two more stops yet to go."
30.10.2010,7.0,"I like this movie okay. It was not something that I would really want to have in my DVD collection as I am more into horror than comedy, but this movie was entertaining. This is mainly due to Christopher Lloyd than anything else, the man brings real energy to his role. Michael J. Fox was good to in the lead role, one has to wonder if ""Family Ties"" held him back a little as he had some rather successful movies during the 80's and could have done more without the television commitment. This one is about time travel, time travel to the past. The next film would feature time travel to the future and the past. That one is a film I can not watch, it is just to hard to for me. It also has not aged well as the future they paint is a future of the 80's, as fashion is never going to be like that I am afraid. This one though has a guy use the professor's time machine and ending back in the past where he kind of interrupts the first meeting of his mother and father. This in turn makes it so he may no longer exist shortly. Thankfully, the professor is around and so he has to work on getting the time machine, which is a car, in working order and Fox has to work on getting his parents back on the right track. Like I said, this one works, as you can recreate a time that is past, the second one doesn't because you can not see what the future is going to be like. The third one though was okay."
26.10.2010,10.0,"""Tell me, future boy! Who was President of the United States in 1985?"" And Marty quipped, ""Ronald Reagon."" ""Ronald Reagon? The actor? Who was vice president? Jerry Lewis?""Honestly, who doesn't love Back to the Future? I mean, seriously, who doesn't love Back to the Future? It's one of those rare movies that after you watch it, it just isn't enough, you have to watch it again. It's been 25 years later, generations had come and go, and even the new generation has fond memories of this remarkable movie.I think a lot of it is in its plot device and imagination. The imagination is so deep that it's almost plausible that you can travel through time with a little plutonium and a flux capacitor at a speed of 88 miles per hour. It could work! But part of the fun is its whimsical charm, and the humor laced into a sort of innocence and lightheartedness felt throughout the movie. The plot alone required some tongue and cheek humor as we find Marty mistakingly going back in time to 1955 - accidentally running into his parents in the process - and discovers that he made a crucial error of taking his dad's place and subjecting himself to his mom falling head over heels for him. Because of this, he created a time paradox that if he doesn't bring his parents together, he will cease to exist. Not only that, but he has only one chance to get back to the future, or be stuck in the past forever.As great as the plot (and especially the script) is, there is one vital importance to carry this film, and that is the performances. The Bobs made a wise decision casting Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly in just the way his mannerisms are, and how animated he is in his expressions. Just watch the scene in the beginning when Marty and Jennifer are outside Hill Valley, and Marty gets a hard on for that new truck. It's a scene that could bore you to tears but it was the writing and the performances that really put those finishing touches. To further demonstrate, just check out the scenes between Marty and Doc Brown (played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd). Their chemistry together is like pancakes and syrup. Neither one of them steals a scene from each other, because they play off each other so well that they almost need each other to sell the scene.As a kid I was inspired to go skateboarding after that scene where Marty outsmarted Biff and his gang on the streets of Hill Valley. To this day, it is a classic scene. But as an adult, I appreciated the action in the ending because of the cinematography. It felt like a terrible night from hell, even if the sound effects are a little outdated. The way everything went wrong and Doc managing to fix the situation in the nick of time that zapped Marty back to 1985. It was all breathtaking stuff, and accompanied by a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and the wonderful direction of Bob Zemeckis.I really can't give a high enough praise for this timeless film. Since 1985, a lot of the dialogue became catch phrases. ""Hello, McFly!"" was a common use of explaining someone was an idiot in my family. I think the world used that too. That might have explained Crispin Glover's lack of involvement for the sequels. I guess he wasn't fond of George McFly. Now that's heavy!"
23.10.2010,10.0,"I just got back from a 25th Anniversary Screening of ""Back to the Future"" at The Puente Hills Mall. Which is the same Mall that was used for the film. It's like stepping into a time machine and going Back to the Past.As a child I used to watch The BTTF Trilogy all the time on video. My favorite ride at Universal Studios was the BTTF ride. And I got really excited when the Trilogy was released to DVD.Now as a teenager, I got extremely excited when I read that there was going to be a Re-Release. The showing was awesome, there were so many other fans, there was clapping during just about every scene.Now for the film. The film follows a really simple plot (which is rare for most time travel adventures). The jokes seem new every time I watch the film. They're always hilarious. And I have to credit the Amazing Cast and Writers for that.For a Comedy, the movie packs a lot of suspense, the climax is beautifully put together with its race against time situation.And what else can I say that hasn't already been said? The movie is one that every person in the world should see. It's really one of the Best Movies of All-Time 10*** out of 10***"
03.10.2010,10.0,"One evening, during my early teen years, I turned on the TV and watched the 1985 classic 'Back to the Future', and my only regret is that I hadn't seen it earlier...The film tells the story of a skateboarding, guitar playing teenager named Marty McFly (played by Michael J Fox) whose life is far from perfect. That is until his eccentric, scientist friend Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) builds a time machine and sends him back to 1955. From there the movie really accelerates into exhilarating fun that get more complicated as it goes on but will keep you entertained until the very end.Pretty much everything about 'Back to the Future' works from the interesting characters, to the clever humour, to the magical experience of going back in time. But without giving too much away, I'm going to let you go see it for yourself. A well worth purchase and a classic for generations to come."
06.09.2010,9.0,"My brother owns the trilogy so when I visited him I sat down and watched the whole thing. Honestly, an excellent use of my time.I loved the story. It had a very interesting plot fueled by original and entertaining characters. To sum it up, a kid gets sent to the past on an unplanned trip via a time machine constructed by his eccentric inventor friend. I don't want to give away any more than that. This is truly one of the best films to come from the '80s. It's colorful, exciting, funny, and filled with a gold mine of amazing '80s lines. The music went with the film perfectly, of course, just fun music when it was a good time, and music to work up the audience when stress was needed. Director Zemeckis did a great job. I could watch this movie again and again. It had no low points, no slowing down. It was genuinely interesting the entire way through.My only problem is one prevalent in many films: overactive coincidence. Sometimes the conflicts were resolved way too easily, and I felt really unsatisfied. Maybe I was taking it too seriously, maybe I was expecting too much, I don't know, but a few moments of the film I was disappointed. No worries though, because the greatness of the film made me forget the hiccups. I still thing it's a super fun ride.This is a perfect movie for family movie night, or hanging out with friends, anything. I can't think of a scenario where viewers wouldn't have a good time watching this movie, except for stuffy, boring people who have no imagination who perhaps just came from a funeral, or something like thatbut you probably shouldn't be watching any movies with people just coming from such a sad event, and you probably shouldn't be hanging out with boring people anywayso yeah, I stand by what I said. No scenario exists where you will not like this movie. I plan on buying it sometime when I get the cash."
03.08.2010,10.0,"Back to the Future isn't just a fantastic sci-fi. It is also a funny comedy, a high school movie, and an action movie. This film takes all these genres, puts them together, and makes a classic. There is so many famous lines in the movie that everyone can have their own favorites. There isn't one joke that falls flat, and there is multiple side stories to it. There is the main story of Marty trying to get back to 1985, the story of him trying to get his parents together, the story of Biff Tannen the bully, and many more. All these side-stories are either predictions in 1955 of what 1985 will have, or they add tension. Marty has to take care of all these problems before he can go back to 1985. Due to the fact that he only has a certain amount of time to do these things tension builds in the climax. It is a great movie, and one of the best of the 1980's.4 stars out of 4"
24.07.2010,10.0,"Well, at this point in time, what more is there to say? When Back To The Future first came out in 1985 I saw it three times at the cinema. Back then it blew my mind and it still does. Great special effects, a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and great costumes. You couldn't imagine any other actors in this. Michael J.Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson are all fantastic. Some people tell me it looks dated now because of the 1980's costumes. My reply is ""That means the 1950's costumes must as well"". If you excuse the pun, this movie is timeless. I've seen this dozens of times and will continue to in the future. Steve Rice."
24.06.2010,9.0,OK this my first movie review so don't be going mad if i don't talk about everything. OK the plot is about this teenager named Marty who's life is going pretty good he as a girlfriend who i forget her name and hes friends with a man called doc brown who never invented anything useful except a time machine which takes Marty back to 1955 and hes has to get back to his present time. think that would be enough to base the movie around but no he accidentally stops his parents from meeting .OK you think you think that's enough he as to stop the doc from being shot my head gets dizzy from thinking about it and i forget the bully biff he is my favorite bad guy of all time and he is such a asshole
13.06.2010,10.0,"This is a great movie, pure and simple. The story is brilliant. Marty McFly gets into a time machine, made out of a car, and created by a man named Doc Brown. As soon as he gets into the car Doc. Brown is shot by people with guns, in a hurry Marty gets into the car and drives away, but because of the fact that it is A TIME MACHINE! He is sent back to the 1950's. He ends up accidentally stopping his parents from falling in love, the Doc Brown of the 50's tells Marty that he must fix them up, of he will cease to exist. The lines and characters of Marty, Doc Brown, and Biff are very likable and-or memorable. Some of the lines that these 3 characters say are some of the most memorable lines. Since ""No Luke, I am your father."" The acting in this motion picture, although not Oscar worthy, is in fact fact great. Michale J. Fox and Christopher Loyd give good performances as Marty and Doc Brown. The best part about this movie are the effects. They are beautiful. Sure today they are not mind blowing, but still good. Now time to wrap this up. So in the end this is a very good Sci-Fi flick, and I recommend it heavily."
08.06.2010,9.0,"I watched this film many times when I was a kid, so now, in 2010, I decided to give it another viewing, if only for the memories of the '80s and the 'flux capacitor' science. What a delight! Sure, there are plot holes, but the sheer awesomeness of almost every scene, the ""well, the flux capacitor is fluxing"" attitude, the not taking itself too seriously make this movie great. The facial expressions and emotions of the actors are wonderful in every scene and the dialogue is amusing. The science of the movie is completely bogus but is not very relevant to the plot and is very believable. I am a big fan of ""Contact"", also by Zemeckis, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is also one of his films, and you can tell by the wonderful soundtrack.Well done!"
06.06.2010,10.0,"Anyone who lives on the planet Earth has got to love this film. It's one of the the greatest sci-fi classics of all time. Director Robert Zemeckis, along with producer/director Steven Spielberg, and many other great movie makers, invent the greatest comedy of all time.However you look at it, whether as an action film, a comedy, a sci-fi, or whatever, it will look excellent no matter what. The effects and sound effects are spectacular, but the hook into the film are the hilarious and lovable characters, the terrific performances, and the editing job put into the film. The story is one of the greatest screenplays ever.Marty Mcfly is an average teen in 1985 whose friend, Doc Brown, invents a time machine out of a Dolorian. Marty accidentally activates it while running from terrorists, and travels to the year 1955, where he meets his parents-to-be as teens, screwing up their first meet. On top of getting them back together, he teams up with the past Doc Brown to fix the time machine to be able to send him back to his time period. The conflicts and plot of the story are all spectacular and work brilliantly to the core.Has tons of laughs along the way. The doc, played by Christopher Lloyd, is without a doubt the best character. His crazy scientist ways will have your gut busted with laughter. The clever irony works terrificly as well, especially with scenes with Martie's teen parents. Conflicts arise, and the film gets more and more entertaining by the minute. Another great character is Biff, who was an old bully of Martie's dad, who becomes one of the main antagonists in the film, as he plans to take Martie's mom, and dispose of Martie's dad. Although he's evil, he still makes you laugh hard.Ends happily, but without spoiling anything, its a simple masterpiece that must be seen."
23.05.2010,5.0,"I saw this movie 10 or maybe 15 years a go. Naturally I liked ""Back To The Future"" as every kid did. So, after a decade and a half last week I've decided to see it again, and man was it a cold shower.OK, let's be honest, Back To The Future films are meant to be a fictional comedy and you can't expect any complexity or dramatic twist. A cool kid with ambition and a classical nutty professor type join their forces in a time traveling adventure. Sounds like a cool plot for the 12-15 generation, but that's as far as it goes. I still find it entertaining yet the simpleness of the whole story does kill the excitement a bit. Also, the commercial aspect of the movies is insultingly obvious. Come on... Pepsi, Delorean, Nike, Toyota... it all shouts of sponsorship and it's placed without any effort of subtleness. It's like the whole budget was dependent on the good fortunes of the sponsors, thus making a movie into an expensive and long commercial. Overall, entertaining, relaxing but that's about it.And another thing. This is not SF!Science Fiction - Fiction based on scientific facts. Flux Capacitor and time traveling dogs are hardly supported by science. Very few films dubbed SF fulfill the standards overall. Adventure, fantasy, comedy, fiction... ""Back To The Future"" is all those things, but SF it ain't!"
27.04.2010,9.0,"I wasn't excited to review Back To The Future because it has become a very popular film, but, after watching it again, I took out my pen and some recycled paper to get it over with. Before writing my review, I read and watched a number of materials about the making of the film. In my opinion, Back To The Future is one of the best science fiction films, even if it is a product of a big Hollywood studio (in this case Universal Pictures). It's one of the founding films in the special effects action blockbuster genre, though few of its successors have half its wit, charm or grace. The entertainment industry now realizes how important it is, and, therefore, the film has been promoted in the media and at conventions. But that's fine. I like it too. So, why do many people like Back To The Future? Firstly, it's an entertaining science fiction comedy. Secondly, its message of changing one's life for the better with a courageous act appeals to the masses. Thirdly, it's a well-cast and well-made 1980s movie. Back To The Future is simply pleasant to watch. Americans can watch it and be reminded of better times - the 1980s and especially the 1950s. Robert Zemeckis directed two good films before Back To The Future - the comedies Used Cars (1980) and Romancing The Stone (1984). In Back To The Future, Zemeckis demonstrated his technological savvy and attention to detail. The DeLorean DMC-12 time machine looks fantastic. The car was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a flying saucer believable. When it comes to the excellent cast, the friendship of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) works very well. It's entirely believable, and it works even better in the sequels - Back To The Future II (1989) and Back To The Future III (1990). The eager, likable Fox is actually good when it comes to the comedy. Also, his upbeat approach to his roles made him perfect for the part of Marty. Lloyd, as the irascible, sardonic Doc Brown, offers sterling support. Another excellent performance is by Crispin Glover as George McFly, the cowardly, nerdy father of Marty. In fact, Glover's performance may be the most effective in the film, and he's funny when it comes to George's nerdy mannerisms, such as his shaky hands. Lorraine Baines-McFly is actress Lea Thompson's most famous role. Zemeckis wanted her for the part after he saw her in The Wild Life (1984), opposite Eric Stoltz. Stoltz played the part of Marty before Zemeckis determined that he had been miscast. It turns out that Thompson is good at impressions. I found her body movements and facial expressions interesting as she played the somewhat shy 1950s teenager Lorraine. She's especially effective in the second half of the film. In addition to the lovely plot and perfect cast, Back To The Future features a wonderful music score by Alan Silvestri. The rock band Huey Lewis and the News provided two catchy songs - The Power of Love and Back in Time. So, there's a lot to like about the film. It's an appealing slice of bourgeois Americana. I have a few issues with its messages, but I definitely recommend it."
15.04.2010,10.0,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
01.04.2010,10.0,"Back to the Future could just be one of the most perfect movies ever made. I'm not one to bash other people's opinions, no matter how much I disagree with them, but I can't understand how you can't like this movie. Maybe think it's overrated, but if you live on this planet, you should like this movie. It isn't my favorite movie of all time, but I can find more flaws in movie's I like more than this.Really, all I can do is nitpick the movie, like how Biff is more of a serial killer than a bully, but what would be the point, it would still just be nitpicking. So yes, it does have some small flaws, but that doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece.OK, the good stuff now, first, there is something in this movie for everyone. It has comedy, it has romance, it has science fiction, it's a high school movie, there isn't much action, but that skateboard chase is pretty awesome. So basically if you want any of those types of movies, you will get it with this film.The characters are so much fun, and very memorable. Marty is extremely likable, Doc is hilarious, Biff is such an asshole yet you still can't help but enjoy him, Lorraine is hot, and George has some great moments. And I love the story, time travel is one of those things that has been around for years and will never get old. Everything works, and I love the little background jokes it does, like how Marty meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, goes back, knocks down a tree, and comes back and it's the Lone Pine Mall.The special effects are great, it's funny as hell, and it's just a lot of fun to watch. It really is one of the most perfect films ever made, the only way to criticise the film is to nitpick, and if you have to do that, then is there really any point in criticising at all?"
25.03.2010,,"This year, John Hughes died, and we were reminded of the depth of his insight into subadult suspension. Being reminded of his work impressed me. What will we think when Zemeckis dies?Certainly we will be reminded of how he balanced fantasy and reality in all of his projects. Possibly it will be noted that he softened the Spielberg approach by unintuitively adding incoherence.I think I will remember two films: this one and ""Roger Rabbit."" These both are deceptively trivial. Was this the first mainstream movie that played as cleverly with time travel conundrums? It was not intended to spawn a sequel, and you can see that certain conventions were established that hurt the successors. But seen by itself, the idea of superimposing actors, characters and times in the same package works well. Makes this a gem.Notable is once again the scientist. You have only two types: pipe smoking, chin stroking blackboard thinker who explains, or what we have here. Lloyd is wildhaired, wild-eyed. A hardware guy, not an idea guy. An active risktaker, frantic in demeanor, but with apparently no sense of scope. For instance, he spends more time on a model of how to explain catching lightning than on the apparatus itself.The film revolves around his instabilities and mirrors those as instabilities in the world. It all starts when he bumps his head getting off the toilet, folded into his minute of death from jilted terrorists. Everything that follows is his wacky vision, joined by Marty when knocked out by the nuclear guitar amp.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
19.03.2010,8.0,"I really don't believe it's possible to not enjoy this movie. It doesn't matter who you ask, I can nearly guarantee everyone has great memories of this film. It's a classic; most people would agree. The story is well-known but for the 1% of you who may not be familiar: Marty McFly is an average teenager living in 1985 until his friend Doc Emmett Brown invents a DeLorean time machine. When problems arise, Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 and he realizes that his actions may have prevented his own existence unless he can correct his mistakes. By now, everyone knows the deal: the car, the characters, and the countless memorable moments.I can't get enough of that DeLorean. It will forever be my favorite film car. Despite having been released in 1985, the effects in this film hold up surprising well. Every time I watch the DeLorean sparking up as it leaving through time, it's like watching it for the very first time. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are two of the most fun characters in cinema history in the form of Marty and Doc. They're perfect; I honestly can't imagine anyone else having been cast in those roles. Honestly, that extends to the supporting cast as well...Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Tom Wilson. I'll always love Glover's performance as Marty's father George and its a shame he didn't return for the sequel.Everyone's got a favorite moment from this film, as it's loaded with fantastic scenes. Mine would have to be Marty's initial reaction to finding himself in 1955 and his guitar performance of ""Johnny B. Goode"" at the dance. Seriously, there isn't much a person can say about this film as just about everyone's seen it and knows how fun it is. It was the start of one of the most entertaining film trilogies and it's a worldwide phenomenon."
26.02.2010,10.0,"This summary perfectly describes my feeling after seeing this movie.The movie is pure....genius. The plot is entertaining till the last minute, the great effects, the exceptional acting from Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lyod.This movie has great qualities for any sci-fi fan. Time-travel, alternate-universes, and DELOREANS! Furthermore, there is little to no errors in the film. There may only be a irk or two in the plot, but it still doesn't take away from the incredible film experience that Steven Spielberg chose to call ""Back to The Future""! An easy 10/10!"
07.01.2010,10.0,"1986 may be the month of July when i was at vacation form my school my bros brought this film home. For the first time i saw Michael.J.Fox , at that time i enjoyed the movie but not that much until when i turned 18 this very same movie was aired on a local channel here in my home town Lahore-Pakistan. At time i was able to understand the subject matter of the Hollywood movies better. That was so funny and also enjoyable watching but imagining your self traveling through time to same place and location where you belong 30 years backward the time in which you don't even exist. Then suddenly you happen to meet your own father who is same old you are now (shocking to unbelievable extant) than ending up inside a home being unconscious lights turns on , a young lady taking care of you sits in front of you ,you scream and become speechless because she will give you birth as your own mother. Meeting than your own grand parents and also meeting especially your youngest maternal uncle who is just a baby but in the future he will become a symbol of humiliation for whole family. Michael.J.Fox now tries to bring closer his parents together , but in a new manner as his future father is quite a weak personality and under confidant ,his mother was inside regretting her decision of marrying him ,another problem is their course met who is after her mother he is kind of jerk and also want to be dominating as his ancestors. But the most funny thing is that his mother falls for him (her own future son she does not know yet). On the other hand i found the most funny but cute character Christopher Lloyd the man who invented the time machine, he introduces Michael Fox to the machine(another funny thing , his dog name is Einstien). My whole family and circle of friends admired it very much and even it became popular in our country(it was also presented in theaters in 86-87), some people here were wondering is it possible. In the future it could be but it demands a lot of energy of solar stars ,BBC once predicted in sci-fi program hosted by X-files Gillian Anderson But it will take years maybe centuries till then keep on enjoying and imagining such cute fantasies."
02.01.2010,10.0,"Back to the Future is a fun comedy about a teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) who has a less than perfect family and is friends with a scientist, Dr. Brown(Christopher Llyod) and he accidentally time travels back to 1955 when his parents are in high school. His mother falls in love with him and he needs to get his parents to love each other, otherwise he will be erased from time. The film, although not completely reliant on special effects, has very good time travel effects. The acting is very good too, more specifically Llyod's performance because he is just hilarious. Biff(Tom Wilson) is also a good villain THe movie is funny, exciting and weird, which make for a great film that anyone would want to see!"
26.12.2009,10.0,Sometimes a film comes along and the timing of its release turns out to be absolutely perfect and in my opinion this is one of those films. Everything about this film feels right and it is nearly two hours of inventive comedy and pretty much anything else you would want from a really entertaining creation. All of the people involved in the making of this film should be congratulated on a job well done. I always enjoy watching it again and I will never lose my enthusiasm for this film. The film could have been released five years before or five years after 1985 and for some reason I do not think it would have had the same effect. We will never know but suffice to say that it is a splendid romp that does not fall into the trap of being too serious and therefore works remarkably well. I would recommend this film to anyone providing they are prepared to tune into the humour and if that happens it will be guaranteed to be an enjoyable experience.
15.11.2009,10.0,"Of course it's not the most serious or deep movie in the world, but it's 1 hour and 48 minutes of pure fun and excitement. This movie was a a classic when it was new, and it has dated well. Even people who don't like old films have both seen and loves this movie. The acting and casting is spot on, the effects are revolutionizing for it's time and the story is brilliant, not very logical but who cares.Michael J. Fox is great as Mary McFly and Christopher Lloyd is at his best in the role as the quirky but genius Doc Brown. And the rest of the cast is just great especially Thomas F. Wilson as Biff who we get to see more of in the two sequels.I really don't think I need to give you a synopsis, if you're one of those who haven't seen this film, just read the IMDb synopsis. but don't bother just watch the film.This movie is exiting and hilariously funny, this is a movie perfect for anyone. It doesn't matter what kind of movie genre you like it's hard not to like this film. I'm not quite sure what more I can say but; if you haven't seen it, Watch it now! Buy it, rent it, download it, whatever just see it. And don't forget it's a trilogy. I can't recommend this film enough. I give it a 10/10."
14.11.2009,10.0,"It's 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn't capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn't get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.It's honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable. Finally it's the cast that seal the deal for why this is as good as it gets for fantasy escapist cinema. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson & Crispin Glover are the perfect quintet, each feeding off each other and doing justice to the excellently constructed story.Made for $19 million, Back To The Future went on to make a worldwide gross of over $381 million, and those are the kind of figures you really can't argue with. It's snappy, happy and down right funny, so really, if you don't like Back To The Future then seek medical help immediately. 10/10"
05.11.2009,9.0,"Marty McFly (Fox) is sent back in time to the year 1955 where he must make sure his parents meet and fall in love, otherwise his existence is in danger.This renowned Oscar winning sci-fi has everything you need for a entertaining viewing, whether with family or a quiet solo night in. Action, comedy and adventure this ticks all the right boxes and is a film we can look at and say is a fine depiction of time travelling mischief and bravery.There have been numerous films to attempt to unravel the complexity of time travel. From The Terminator to the Butterfly effect we have robots and unexplained seizures telling a theory on how travelling through the void can happen.In this 1985 release the complexity of the lexis is weighed down to a comedy level to fit the mood of the moment, and through the wonderfully buoyant Emmet Brown we see his theory of the flux-capacitor and the use of plutonium to achieve the unachievable is brilliant appreciation of the target audience. There is no over the top scientific knowledge as we take Dr Brown as he is an overly knowledgeable protagonist, and doesn't Christopher Lloyd do well? The star shows a very eccentric style to portray a subtle madness and delicious exuberance to deliver one wonderful mad scientist that gives the film, and trilogy, its main source of comedy and resourcefulness.Lets not forget Michael J Fox in arguably his most profound role from his illustrious career as the unbelievably cool teen who gets wrapped up in events. Fox's appreciation for cool is never over the top and fits even today's modern teenage stereotype. But to associate him with today would be unfair. He is way too cool for any kind of label. He skateboards, he has an attractive girlfriend, he plays the guitar and drinks Pepsi, what more can you say? He is the coolest kid in time.Whilst the plot is easy to enjoy and relaxing unconditional fun there is a level of importance of attention to be maintained as the plot's intention of science bases itself on a few key rules. Such as what can alter the future, saying the wrong thing and the difference from the present and the future. All run however thoroughly and with plenty of zest and humour to satisfy any viewer's entertainment requirements.The opening sequence with the clocks is fantastic panning and good timing (no pun intended) as Marty enters and blasts the stereo. This sets the tone for the coolness of the main character and builds everything around the complexity of time.This really is fantastic fun with wonderful characters and a springy adventurous minded script that never hinders on the past, not literally obviously. Parts II and III are well balanced fun, but this was where it all started and what a fantastic beginning it was"
03.11.2009,10.0,"I'm a tough guy to please, but this timeless (pun intended) film is simply a total joy from start to finish and on every level you can imagine.A perfect script, wonderful performances from every single cast member, immaculate inspired direction and absolutely perfect pacing make this one of the few films that you will never ever tire of.Once in a decade or so, someone has an idea for a story that is simply genius. This is one of those stories. It is astonishing that what is actually quite a complex tale of time paradoxes becomes so accessible and easy to follow. You will be swept along on a wave of pleasure.Every time I see it I marvel at the imagination, the humour, the sheer joie de vie of a film for which no audience member could fail to be moved and thrilled.Truly a cinematic masterpiece and a treasure for all ages.(And the sequels are great too!)"
03.10.2009,10.0,"Hard to find fault with this film in any way. This is the only film I have watched in the Cinema where the audience broke out in spontaneous applause at it's conclusion. Michael J Fox was perfect for the part and all the cast and Christopher Lloyd is exceptional, creating one of those characters that you will always remember. The 2 sequels are both good but nothing matches this first film and the excitement it generates. My only small criticism was the Johnny B Goode scene where a supposed relative of Chuck Berry says to him on the phone 'I've found that new sound you were looking for' .... When will black music artists start getting credit for giving us all the great genres of music? OK I know it was tongue in cheek humour but it just annoys me. Rant over! It is still a 10/10 movie."
05.09.2009,10.0,"Back to the Future is a film that for people of my generation would have growth up with, along with other important films like the original Indiana Jones films, Stars Wars trilogy, the first two Alien films, the Rocky Series and Mad Max 1 and 2 (just to name a few). Here is a fun family film that has stood the test of time.Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), is a 17-year-old teenager living in Hill Valley, California. He has a loving family, a good girlfriend and helps a mad scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). But he lives in a geeky family, his dad George (Crispin Glover) is bullied by his supervisor and avoids confrontation, his mum Lorraine (Lea Thompson) has conservative values and doesn't like Marty's relationship with Jennifer (Claudia Wells), and Marty's brother and sister are generally geeky. One Dr. Brown, aka 'Doc', asks for Marty's assistance and records the experiments with his next invention, a time machine (in the design of a DeLorean DMC-12). The test seems successful until Libyan terrorists kill 'Doc' and whilst on the run Marty ends up travelling back in to 1955. Whilst in 1955 Marty meets both his mum and dad as teenagers, and interferes with how they met. By doing this he messes up the time-space continuum and risks his own existences. The younger version of Lorraine falls for Marty, not know he is her future son; adding both to comedy and general creepiness. It's a race against time, both to get back to 1985 and to insure destiny is fulfilled by his setting up his parents.Back to the Future is a family sci-fi comedy which is a symbol of its time. It works as a fish out of water comedy, teen comedy and a general look at time travel. They is a simple plot and theme about Marty finding out who his parents are and looks at the similarities and differences of live in the 50s and 80s. The aim of the filmmakers was to make a fun film, and Robert Zemeckis does this. He is a protégé of Steven Spielberg and he keeps the story simple and entertaining. He also shows his skills as a special effects director which in this film were very good. The special effects help the story, but don't overshadow it. They is a very good script to this film, mixing drama and comedy, and hasn't dated badly. The film is humorous and light-hearted. The humour is not crude, like it it in some family films. There is a strong story and with good messages for kids about standing up to bullies and respecting your parents. Michael J. Fox was perfectly casted for the lead role and there are many excellent supporting cast members. Lea Thompson was perfectly pretty as Lorraine and Crispin Glover was fine as a needy kid. Christopher Lloyd and Thomas F. Wilson were really excellent as the mentor and the villain.Back to the Future is an influential family film. It is a mark of pop-culture with this movie being parodied in Family Guy and Futurama. It is Robert Zemeckis' best film (though Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a close second)."
05.09.2009,8.0,"Since first seeing this classic in 1985 and thru the years from premium cable, TV network, video, DVD, and cable showings ""Back to the Future"" has always been an enjoyable film. I've saw it enough many times and whether it be with family or by myself I still enjoy. Clearly the film is well liked for it's theme even though time travel is fantasy, still when blended with adventure and great sci-fi special effects ""Back to the Future"" is without a doubt a memorable classic.Directed by film master and genius Steven Spielberg along with special effects wizard Robert Zemeckis they helped make this film one of the most groundbreaking works of all-time. And the story is a catch even though mostly wrapped up in fantasy still the time travel plot sells to all of our hearts making us fall in love with the time travel fantasy. 1980's TV star Michael J. Fox(""Family Ties"")stars as teen Marty McFly a down on his luck and out of touch high school slacking teenager who's only hope of escape in his present day 1985 is his love of rock music and being buddies with his sidekick wild scientist Dr. Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Yet both feel history is about to change as Doc Brown has created a time machine inside his DeLorean car. Oddly this is groundbreaking yet both become mixed up in a time shattering chain reaction that could keep them stuck in the past with a vaporized future.Strangely they travel back to 1955 at a critical time when Marty's parents had yet to meet. During this time conflict and danger is abound as Marty has to be careful not to expose to much of his identity to his important past, because that is his critical future that he must protect from obstacles. In the past it was fun to see Marty having to force his parents to get together, and plus putting up with old high school bully Biff was entertaining and comical.Lessons learned from this movie is time travel though fun and interesting like seeing the past of your hometown and the fact that you would get to meet your parents before they conceived you would be great, still when facing the conflicts of identity exposure and dealing with past pest(Biff) and unexpected events would be very dangerous and risky. Still ""Back to the Future"" is now an immortalized pop culture film classic coming along in a time the mid 80's that showcased and interesting fantasy plot of time travel that filled our entertainment thirst. As it was such a memorable and well liked film for showing that it would be nice and such a dream for anyone to go back and see important things in their past while in the meantime it's such a good feel to be able to shape things in your past that lead to a happy future just like Marty's character did in the film. The adventure and action special effects blend in well with the fantasy theme to make ""Back to the Future"" a film that's unforgettable, memorable and one that will certainly stand the test of time!"
05.07.2009,10.0,"I first caught Back To The Future when i was very young, one Christmas at home. I was only born in 81, so i was hooked from early childhood.I have to say that i never have got bored of this film, no matter how many old VHS tapes i wore out through watching. With the sound off i could tell you every word, and hum along to every tune.The combination of Lloyd and Michael J Fox is inspired, with the youthful cheek of Marty and the crazy flare of the Doc. Every scene is full of rich acting, maybe not the heavy Oscar winning performances, but i think better, in that it just feels real. I will never get tired of how Fox can act so naturally.Another element for me is the iconic Delorean, being a car fan i think its a great choice, and at about 5 years old it just looks amazing! I have read one of the early release scripts from about 84, where the Delorean was going to be an RV, and the Doc was a womaniser. I'm very glad it did not come out that way.It is also one of just a few films unspoiled by its sequels, even if II did loose a little in story depth, III helps to just bring them all together.Just thinking about it now, I think i'll have to break out the DVD box set."
03.07.2009,10.0,"What teenage boy didn't want to be Marty McFly (Fox) if they grew up in the 80s? I certainly did. He had it all: someone he loved and loved him back, a best friend that could literally send him on adventures, played guitar in a band, a carefree spirit – using vehicles to accelerate his skateboarding, including a cop's and to be able to time-travel – catching his parents in future lies. I grew up on 'Back to the Future'; I must've watched it 50 times as a kid, never knowing I was taking for granted how much this comedic adventure masterpiece was completely unique and rarely a movie such as this comes around. Watching this now, having watched 1000s of movies since its release 24 years ago, I appreciate it all the more. The movie has great, pitch-perfect lines/comedy, extreme adventure, a heart, still well-made special effects and it certainly reminded me of how great movies used to be made: pre-CGI. Nothing against CGI, a lot of movies today benefit from the effect, but you have to appreciate the 50s town they recreated to scale, making me believe I was there. Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955 by his best friend (played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd) Doc Brown and after a few scenes to convince him he's really back in time, he seeks the aid of Brown to get, well, ""back to the future."" At the same time, its damage-control with the paradox he creates that almost erases his own existence. Sure, it had minor flaws: Fox definitively didn't look like a teenager in the sequels –he barely pulls it off here and of course there's the typical 80s numerous product placements, down to the DeLorean itself – ironically, not enough to save the doomed car. Still, an absolute must-see."
26.06.2009,10.0,"Christopher Lloyd stars alongside Michael J. Fox in the fantastic Back to the Future. Essentially, the plot revolves around time travel— Marty McFly (Fox) goes back in time, messes around, and accidentally causes his mother to fall in love with him instead of his father. He has to fix his mistake or else he may be wiped out from existence.Robert Zemeckis was the perfect man to direct this film. In it, I couldn't help detecting some of the spirit of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (one of my favourite movies). This movie can be thrilling or exciting, but the key element throughout is fun. This is simply a fun film to watch. Cultures from the 80s and 50s clash, Marty discovers his prudish mother was once a teenager like him too, and in general, the film proves to be enjoyable.The film's music (a fantastic score composed by Alan Silvestri) really epitomizes the spirit of fun that permeates the film. Its triumphant tones at certain key moments are not obtrusive; instead of adding to the awareness that one is watching a movie, it seems to engross the viewer even more.I will freely admit that the film's outcome is evident from the very beginning. However, the road that takes the audience there is full of fun, unexpected twists and turns.The Verdict: Plain, old-fashioned fun, and it can be the topic of discussion for hours (although I've avoided it here for spoiler purposes). A great movie.Overall Rating: 10/10"
15.06.2009,10.0,"That's exactly what I said after viewing this movie for the first time years ago. Back to the Future is one of the most successful films of the 80's, and today no film has done better at keeping you on the edge of your seat, and laughing the entire time. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, an average high school kid of the 1980's who ends up accidentally getting sent back in time to the year 1955 after his friend, Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. Now, trapped in time, Marty has to find a way to get back into his own time. There's more elements to the plot, but I don't want to spoil the entire movie for you. Most people have probably seen this movie at some point in their life, but if you haven't, it's a must see. It has everything you could want from a movie: comedy, action, suspense, and great special effects for it's time. I love Back to the Future. It's one of my favorite movies, and it definitely deserves recognition as one of the best movies of all time."
26.04.2009,8.0,"Okay, let's look at this objectively. The filming is the only thing that doesn't stand out. It does it's job to convey a point, and that's it. No eye boggling cinematography here.The music is memorable and enhances the scenes immensely. Great catchy, well varied songs that make you feel what the characters are: Earth Angel and Johnny B. Goode come to mind. 9/10 It's rare to have memorable characters in film since little details get washed over, but BTTF's plot is highly character based, which works in being entertaining as well as informative. You'll remember all the names of these characters. 9/10 The plot itself is quite simple, but well executed. It's fun with all the different genres. 7/10 The acting is excellent. Chris Lloyd's performance is very over the top and eccentric, but memorable all the same. Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson's performances are very honest and moving. 9/10In terms of entertainment I find all the foreshadowing (1985) a little dull, but it's impossible to delete it since it introduces all the characters. The script is very tight and well written, the tension builds as the film goes along.I've watched this a few times so I'd say the re-watch value is very good."
21.04.2009,10.0,"As you probably could've guessed from my username, Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future is one of those very special and rare movies that I would defend vehemently. One of the most inventive, adrenaline-pumping, amusing and eye-popping movies of all time, and one that's completely devoid of pretension, pomposity and self-consciousness, Back to the Future is a film that never fails to leave me feeling like I'm on Cloud Nine. Here's why.The year is 1985. Rebellious Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, a last-minute replacement for Eric Stoltz, who failed to exude the laidback charm Zemeckis wanted the character to have) lives in the quaint (and fictional) Californian town of Hill Valley, where he has a beautiful and supportive girlfriend named Jennifer (played by Claudia Wells). Marty despairs of his alcoholic mother Lorraine and pushover father George (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) and thus spends most of his time hanging out with Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), a goofball scientist who, as it turns out, has just invented a DeLorean time machine (the time machine originally was intended to be a refrigerator, but Zemeckis changed it to a car because he worried that after seeing Marty walk through a refrigerator kids would follow suit). During a test run, however, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955. Now, whilst trying to get back to the future, he encounters run-ins with his father's lifelong bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and must somehow make sure his parents-to-be meet and fall in love – which is not as easy it sounds when Lorraine falls head over heels in love with him.There is no department that makes a false move on this film. Firstly, the cast dynamic is flawless: Fox's Everyman affability has never been put to better use, Lloyd enjoys what is unquestionably the defining role of his career as the nutty scientist, Thompson and Glover revel in playing Marty's parents as teenagers and adults in middle-age, and Wilson brings menace and later even a little accurate lowliness to his role as the pathetic bully who finally gets his comeuppance. Technically, Back to the Future has aged like wine as well: the art direction is effective in its subtlety and accuracy to '50s culture, the editing is swift, but not to an extent that you can't make out everything that's happening on-screen, and although there aren't as many of them as you'd think given the type of film this is, the special effects are still superb by today's standards. Alan Silvestri's jazzy, electronic score is yet another element that raises the excitement enormously.But at the end of the day, this really is Bob Zemeckis' show. Firstly he and Bob Gale co-wrote an ingenious screenplay so bursting with invention and peppered with sparkling humour (see the 1955 dinner scene, most notably) and heart that the years have done nothing to lessen the sense of wonder it brings. Secondly, his direction of Back to the Future is perfectly executed, especially for a blockbuster (and even I must admit to having a love/hate relationship with blockbusters sometimes): Zemeckis' directorial effort here is energetic, slick, cunning and fast-paced in the action scenes and cleverly subtle in the slower moments, his passion for the story apparent in every frame. Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich, leave the blockbusters to the true masters and stop embarrassing yourselves.Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, one of the highest-grossing films of the '80s and a film that continues to have a huge impact on popular culture and film-making to this day, is a spectacular blockbuster that flawlessly combines dazzling and incredibly exciting action sequences with a sweet thematic centre that never ventures into cheesy territory, all the while being laced with wickedly funny humour. It's a film that, like very few of its contemporaries, has managed to avoid developing a negative reputation due to its large-scale success and continues to enchant new legions of young movie fans as well as remaining an all-time favourite of many older movie fans, and it will continue to do that for many years to come."
02.04.2009,8.0,"The opening shots of Back to the Future set up the film's ideas and general tone. We are treated to several inventions and gadgets and gizmos, within someone's kitchen and living area, designed to seamlessly ease into one another as the beginnings to a day are kick started. Maybe a television will come on; a robotic arm will pour dog foot into an already over stuffed bowl and toast will pop up when ready, but very burnt. The idea here is that this stuff can work, but to what negative effect? It's quite clear this area hasn't been occupied for a while and the dog food will surely leave a foul smell for when the owner returns but what's that compared to the fire hazards in both the TV and the toast? This is what the film will eventually branch out into; a piece about technology and inventions working but with what, potentially quite terrible, results.Back to the Future is one of those rare and special films that feel tilted more toward a younger audience and yet bear no harm in being revisited by others later on in years. The film can amuse and is able to sustain humour and interest, no matter how wacky the characters are or the predicament is. The film can frighten and additionally pay sly homage to history whilst it includes a fair few gags to how the protagonist's actions perhaps changed the course of history as we know, those being more directed toward the adult watching audience with Marty McFly's rendition of 'Johnny B. Goode' a great example. The film is a near masterpiece, bordering on greatness as it seamlessly entertains, humours, delivers a brilliant and inventive narrative whilst even feeling brave enough to touch on elements of a Freudian nature.Of Marty McFly, he is played by Michael J. Fox in what is a big-screen career defining role. The piece of brilliant technology that is used to a certain degree of negative effect is the time machine a certain Doctor Emmett Brown (Lloyd) built out of a DeLorean automobile. The film revolves around Marty using this invention to travel back to 1955, following an escape from some hostiles out for Emmett, and a consequential accidental changing of history equating in the danger of Marty himself quite possibly being scrubbed out of history.As a stand alone film, Back to the Future offers pretty perfect family entertainment. Its balance of fun and games mixed with a foreboding scenario, a scenario that lies at its very heart, is perfectly captured when McFly wanders down the Hill Valley street in 1955 following going back and witnessing how different his town was thirty years ago before the reality of the situation hits him in ominous fashion. Buried deep within Back to the Future might well be a statement on the condition of then contemporary America. Its two worlds of 1955 and 1985 exhibit the same facilities and general look, but offer very different outlooks on ways of living in the respective years. While porno theatres exist in the 80s, cinemas were playing the cream of Classical Hollywood back in the day; while shops and business' look shoddy, run down and some are even out of business in the modern age but they were clean and bristling with activity in the past.The film even pokes fun at mayoral promises, promising a bright outlook in the 1950s but we, as does the film's lead, know the truth of what becomes of the town. Without obviously pointing fingers, the film shares a joke with us to do with how remarkable it is that Ronald Reagan is the 1985 president. It enjoys telling us that Marty's home estate-to-be will be one of the 'best places to live' come development, but the harsh reality of it is that it's anything but. This is something the second film touches on more when the quality of living deteriorates even more when a powerful political figure (that would be this film's antagonist Biff) has a say in how the town is run, echoing Marty and Emmett's brief but poignant conversation to do with how unbelievable Emmett finds it that Ronald Reagen is the president in 1985.But while the film's political slant isn't its primary focus, you can't help but feel the film is a reference to how the author is very fond of the 1950s or the past in particular, something he sees to have been so much better than the present day. Marty's accidentally and ill advised attempts at changing history result in his teenage mother potentially falling in love with him, subject matter deemed too taboo for Disney and they rejected the film, but the ideas aren't played for sick laughs and the film doesn't linger on the actual notion as much as it does focus on Marty's reactions to all these realisations his would-be mother is having towards him. The 'park' scene in particular acts as an example as to how Marty feels about the situation with the overly dramatic facial expressions acting as an offbeat and drastic reaction to the predicament. It's additionally easy to forget that, by the end, his mother's attention turns more towards George, like history should be, highlighting what a vulnerable girl she is and how easily it is for this girl to fall for someone else at such a delicate time in her life.This factor deflects the idea of the mother falling too deeply in love with her own would-be son somewhat, as we realise how naive she really is to fall again so quickly. But the film is full of ideas and energy, arguably being the best of its 'type' at the time of release. Producers didn't think people would take to it due to its lack of 'risqué' but years later, it stands head and shoulders above all the other 'more risqué' teen films that were released at that time."

Since July 3, 1985 when the first film was released, fans from all walks of life can recall Hollywood history through the eyes of Marty Mcfly as he travels through time in the plutonium powered Delorean. The following fans are really the people to thank for keeping the BTTF trilogy alive. With numerous props, books, DVDs, VHS tapes, vintage McDonald toys, the eBay world is THE place to shop BTTF aside the online store from the direct web site. In the pilot film, Doc Brown introduces the Delorean time machine as the choice machine for time travel. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty Mcfly, the teenager who goes back,..... to 1955 where he meets his parents to be. Interfering with their first meeting, Marty must fix the relationship with the help of Dr. Emmett Lathrop Brown and get back to 1985 in time. From start to finish, fans all agree that Back To The Future is one of the largest film icons of the 1980s."
27.12.2008,10.0,"I don't care what anybody says...I love this film.I have watched it more than 80 times, and I still love.From the story, to the setting, the music, the effects, the casting, the makeup, costumes, set design---everything.This is the BEST movie EVER made.I've seen a lot...I like a lot...but nothing tops this...not now, not then, not before this was released at theaters.The entire crew - cast, - extras and everybody involved should be rewarded very handsomely for this...and the following sequels.There may be some flaws in the story...but I love it.There has not been one time when this was on screen that I ever switched it to something else.Nothing else comes close. As far as I'm concerned...nothing ever will.I am so impressed with this movie that I don't even know how to end this comment aside of to state that if all films were made of this caliber, every movie would be a blockbuster.23 years later and this is till my favorite movie. It withstood the test of time, it never seems outdated...it is so cleverly structured and developed that if anything else ever comes this close to it, there might be some slim chance in hell that movies will be somewhat entertaining.Whenever the theme music comes on the speakers, I crank it up.Wow...what can I say that is negative about it? Only that I was not part of it...and yet, maybe that's a good thing.VERY IMPRESSED!!!!!!!!"
05.12.2008,9.0,"My Take: A modern classic sci-fi comedy.Still stands out as one of the most creative and funny comedies of all time, as well as a creative piece of science fiction, BACK TO THE FUTURE is fun, funny as well as fast-paced and very entertaining. Greatly contributing from a clever screenplay and playful yet professional handling by director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg, BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic of its kind, and I think it's also one of a kind.The special effects have surely dated a bit, considering that the pattern for effects have advanced through the years. But they're still a lot of elaborate fun. Besides, perhaps the real ""special effect"" of the film is the clever screenplay. Written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, the script has dozens of very clever and ingenious ideas. The entire concept explanation of time travel remains original and brilliant until now, even providing some inspiration for other time-travel films 'ala BLAST FROM THE PAST.Michael J. Fox plays the teenage Marty McFly, who is accidentally whisked back in the year 1955 when he hops aboard a time-traveling Delorean created by the near-mad Dr. E. Brown, or simply Doc (played hilariously by Christopher Lloyd). Once there, he gets into trouble with his would-be parents, still teenagers, when her would-be mother (Lea Thompson) falls in love with him, instead of his would-be father (Crispin Glover), which sets the film's hilarious comedy with a difference.Despite some occasionally bad language, BACK TO THE FUTURE is perfect family entertainment, and I think it still is. It's fun and original, something that most recent, more expensive blockbusters can't do at the same time. And unlike most films that it could have been, BACK TO THE FUTURE doesn't get bogged down to a pure special effects exhibition. The film has a lot of fun with its actors and script, and values them as much as any million dollar effects thrown in. For those, very few, who haven't seen it, don't afford to miss it! Rating: ****1/2 out of 5."
01.10.2008,10.0,"Back to the Future is a very good movie, better than I thought it would be. Everything is just about perfect with this film considering it came out in the mid-80's. The story is about a guy named Marty and his professor friend Dr. Brown. Brown invents a time machine in a car and Marty uses the car to travel to 1955 after a tragedy happens. While in 1955 and after messing up the way his parents met, he must fix this problem to avert another tragedy. The acting and directing in this film is great. The story is funny and some lines made me laugh like a hyena. The music makes the movie sound like a true 80's movie. ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis is an instant classic! Overall, this a movie classic for the ages. I rate this film a 10/10."
27.09.2008,9.0,"It's hard to believe it's been 22 years since the original BTTF came out, so the fact that the movie is that old shows it truly is a CLASSIC in every sense of the word. I'm so glad they made this trilogy, what a wild ride it was. It certainly holds up to the test of time because it's just as fun to watch it now as it was back in '85. The world has changed so much since then and watching these movies is a nice escape from today's nerve wrecking reality. I wish I could get my hands on Doc's time machine so I could go back in time to fix the mistakes I made in my life... who doesn't!?! Cherish these movies and show them to your kids and grandkids... they will love them so much you can count on them sharing the adventure of Marty Mcfly and Doc well into their FUTURE!"
18.09.2008,,"What can I say; it's the usual Spielberg/Zemeckis sensibility; a little dumbed-down and ""B-movie""-ish, while delivering genuine humor and pathos.They're movies ""for the masses;"" the writing, scenario work, pacing, directing is carefully designed to fill in the blanks for our slower brethren, but it works on many levels and has something for everyone.After all these years, it's still a great trilogy.Which reminds me of perhaps the most amazing thing of all. In stark contradiction to the immutable law of sequels, the trilogy gets better with each installment; the third is a marvel, feeling like the storyline has reached maturity. Perhaps, by the time they were shooting the third, the money folks backed off a tad and let the creative people breathe: You can feel it. The hyperbolically directed leads are actually given some slack to ply well-honed stage-style theatrical skills, and it looks and feels well-rounded and true.Also, the film is simultaneously dated--'80s American youth values, without serious circumspection--and yet somehow timeless. Perhaps the feeling is that there *is* a kind of circumspection; that Marty, by story's end, has actually grown a little. Always nice to see some of that leak out of a ""pop"" movie."
15.09.2008,9.0,"The second movie is my favorite, where the gang goes into the future and experiences a world quite different from the mid 80's. I was a child from the 80's, and remember these movies well, and I also remember back in the day everyone thinking that the future would be exactly like this movie portrayed it to be like. It wasn't, at least not *yet* in the year 2007 (in the movie, they go to the year 2015, so unless some major changes happen in the next eight years, all those flying vehicles and life-like television screens will probably not be happening in our reality any time soon). It was just a lot of fun to sit there and think that back in the 80's, people really thought our world was going to change THAT drastically. Lots of fun scenes. Anyway, I haven't seen the second movie in quite a long time, and was surprised that the quality of the storytelling has held up extremely well through the years, and the movie doesn't look like your typical 80's film either (you know, with lots of dated-sounding loud saxophone playing, yuck!) I was also surprised that the characters actually went back to the year 1955 for quite a long time. Talk about telling a story with lots of twists and turns. Awesome! These are seriously some of the most exciting movies that have ever existed. The first movie is a classic, and the third one is really good as well, even though many people point to the third movie as being the obvious weakpoint in the series. Maybe, maybe not. I don't really know. I just know I love these films and wanted to comment on how well they've held up after all this time. A series of movies that are worth watching over and over again, and I normally only watch movies once or twice. Not in this case."
13.08.2008,10.0,"Back to the Future, starring Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Tom Wilson, and Claudia Wells was great. The director (Robert Zemeckis) and actors were dynamic. The writers (Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale) cooperated really well. When this movie came out in 1985, it was a huge blockbuster. It was the initial movie in the series of three. It covers many genres. This film wasn't adapted from a book. It was actually written in the writers' own words. Here's how I found out about it: I was at Universal Studios and I went on a ride called ""Back to the Future."" Then, after the ride, my parents told me about this picture. So I found out about it through word of mouth. Out of all the Universal movies that I've seen, this is the best!"
29.07.2008,,"Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics."
18.07.2008,9.0,"The majority of 80's comedies have aged very poorly. They are not all necessarily bad, but they have a distinct 80's feel. This is not as much of a problem with Back to the Future, probably because a large part of it does not take place in the 80's! Although it does have more of an 80's feel than its sequels, I think Back to the Future will be enjoyed by audiences for many more years to come. The film has a wonderful blend of comedy, science fiction, and action so that it works on many different levels. Robert Zemeckis and the crew were able to create a perfect 1950's atmosphere, with great sets, 50's music, and 50's television shows.Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents a time machine out of a Delorean (a perfect choice for its futuristic look). Marty travels back to the year 1955 and accidentally prevents his father from meeting his mother, endangering his own existence. He must enlist the help of a younger Doc Brown to repair the time machine and get his parents together before he literally disappears! Things go awry when Biff (Thomas Wilson), the bully who controls George McFly's life, interferes with Marty's plans at every turn.The relationships between these characters really elevate this film above its sequels. Lloyd and Fox have terrific chemistry and are always a riot in every scene together. Crispin Glover is hilarious as the nerdy George McFly, and Lea Thompson is a delight as Lorraine Banes, Marty's mother. Marty's scenes with his parents remind us that our parents were once teenagers too. Marty learns that he has more in common with his parents than he thought. He has the same fears as his father and his mother's rebellious spirit. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty that should be disgusting, but Thompson's charm and Fox's awkwardness make it hilarious.I should devote some credit to the film's special effects and action scenes. In order to go forward in time, Marty and Doc have to harness the energy from a bolt of lightning and channel it into the flux capacitor (which makes time travel possible) while driving the Delorean at 88 miles per hour. This sequence remains one of the most exciting scenes I have ever watched, in large part due to Alan Silvestri's score, and I love how they were able to give the clock tower a significant role in every Back to the Future movie. The time machine going back in time is just as impressive today.Back to the Future is my favorite film by Robert Zemeckis, and I doubt he will top it."
05.07.2008,10.0,"There are few things I remember in my life, my memory is not so good, but one thing i will never forget is seeing Back to the Future in movie theaters. It was an almost religious experience, even as a kid I knew I was seeing something special. And it stuck with me, something I have passed onto my daughter who now has a crush on Marty. Not what I was wanting, but its a start. Plus how can you go wrong with a movie that has given us so many classic quotes? Michael J Fox at his best, Christopher Lloyd at his funniest since Taxi and that theme song...I still get chills when I hear it. A great movie and a movie experience to be shared."
30.06.2008,10.0,"Back to the future can only be described as a 1980's culture epic. This seems to be the first of the director and writer Robert Zemeckis' bright idea's which seem to come along once a decade, other film's he's noted for include the 2007 3D-Beowulf and Forest Gump.The whole film can be seen as nothing short of spectacular family fun. A great treat for any kid or adult looking to have a nice time. Beyond the wonderful mask the film wears though it has themes of bullying, class, incest, love, and justice. All the while containing a perfectly paced film that never lets you down. It may not be the worlds greatest film ever made, though that is up to opinion. But could be seen as a shining example of a good film. It's plot is relatively easy to understand, but it never treats the audience as stupid.The acting isn't bad, (despite my hatred for Michael J fox: See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqUo8RaJ23Q . This is how much I dislike Michael J. Fox) and the film shows brilliant parallels between scenes, all the while being an adventure with lovable characters, and an insight to a world far from our own. With great music from the 80's, including The power of love, by (see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-hUkO13Fy8)Huey Lewis and the news, memorable for other scenes in film history.Recommendations: Back to the future II & III, Works of Stephen Spielberg and Forest Gump. The magic 8-ball gives three thumbs up."
29.06.2008,10.0,"Few things are as difficult to accomplish as a movie dealing with time-traveling. To take on themes as risky as paradoxes and time loops you primarily need a healthy dose of courage and ambition, but most importantly loads of writing talent and cinematic vision. The scenario of ""Back to the Future"", courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and co-producer Bob Gale, is honestly one of the most brilliant ones ever penned down and, thanks to the financial support of several acclaimed producers (including Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall), it also became one of the most massively entertaining films of all time, with sublime special & sound effects, diversity of genres and some of the greatest casting choices and acting performances ever. ""Back to the Future"" is quintessentially speaking a Sci-Fi comedy, but Robert Zemeckis admirably also hints at the more emotional and melodramatic aspects regarding time traveling. Also, even though the film boosts some of the greatest effects ever, their use merely remains functional and occasionally, so that the emphasis continuously lies on the story and the development of the characters instead of on flamboyant machinery and overlong speeches about scientific theories. The DeLorean is a stylish and original piece of scenery, but other than the fantastic and already legendary vehicle there are no giant laboratories with thousands of flickering lights. Marty McFly is a typical mid-80's teenager with a skateboard he knows how to use and a delightful high school sweetheart that loves him very much. His parents George and Lorraine, however, are a pitiable and hopelessly old-fashioned couple and thus he spends most of his free time with his genius but slightly eccentric friend Doc Brown. The latter invented a time-traveling device and, following a series of bizarre events, Marty accidentally travels back to 1955; the year his parents met and fell in love during the school prom. Marty has only one chance to return to the future, but in the meantime he has to correct the events he tampered with in order to save the future and even assure his own birth. The script is very well constructed and literally stuffed with witty little details that refer to earlier events and/or events that have yet to appear, either later in the film or even in one of the sequels. The humor works, the light-headed tone and atmosphere puts a big smile on your face, you come to care for the characters and the awesome soundtrack even makes it difficult to remain in your seat. Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson all give away excellent performances, but my two preferred roles are for Christopher Lloyd (with his confused looks and bizarre facial expressions, he makes a superb mad scientist) and Crispin Glover. The latter appears to be born to depict weirdos and uncanny freaks, so the role of introvert and mysterious George McFly fits him perfectly."
20.06.2008,10.0,"Back to the Future is the perfect movie. After countless (upwards of two dozen) viewings, I am convinced that it is flawless and in my opinion, the most enjoyable movie ever made. The movie's premise is teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time and screws up his parents' first meeting. What separates this from any other sci-fi movie is the constant humor and more than anything, the fun that everyone so clearly had in making it. The actors are all great and perfectly cast, and the movie is never boring; literally every moment is enjoyable. And it seems to get better with every viewing. From the opening song ""The Power of Love"" to the fantastic climactic ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" Dance, Back to the Future will captivate you. My favorite movie of all time is a timeless classic that will never get old and gets better every time I watch it. A perfect 10/10!"
18.06.2008,10.0,"This movie is one of my favorite movies all time!! When I was 7 years old, I watched this amazing movie for the first time and since then I've watched it more than 10 times!! However I haven't lost interest in this movie. I continue to be fun of ""Back to the future"" forever!! In 1985, Marty McFly (Michel J. fox) is a 17-year-old living in Hill Valley, California and his eccentric friend, scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Loyd) who invents a time-machine, DeLorean are heroes of this story. One night, the terrorists find doc, and kill him because he steals plutonium for fuel of DeLorean. Accidentally Marty gets sent back to 1955, when Marty's parents are in their teens. At first, Marty finds a younger Doc who helps him to try and makes his parents fall in love with each other or else Marty won't be born. In the end, they try to go back to 1985, the year he is originally from....I'd like to recommend this movie to you, because I think this movie is the best in sci fi movies!!! It's a heart-warming movie and a touching movie, so if you watch it, you may feel happy!! Why I love this movie is that the plot (the story) is perfect!!!! The time-machine existing in 1985 is unrealistic, however you will be absorbed in this story, because there are a lot of thrilling scenes in this film. Therefore you can't take your eyes off to the end!! I also like the soundtrack, maybe everybody has heard it!! When I listen to this movie's soundtrack, I feel lighter at heart!!"
16.06.2008,10.0,"The title of this movie is ""Back to the Future"". In 1985, Marty Mcfly who is an everyday teenager went to the time travel in 1955 with a time machine ""DeLorean"". It is invented by Marty's friend Doctor Emmett Brown(Doc). But the accident happenes. Marty privents his father and mother's first meeting accidentally. Then he has to get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence. In addition, there is one more accident in 1985. It happens to Doc!! DeLorean uses plutonium as fuel so Doc steals plutonium from Libyan fringe group then they shoot him to death. So Marty has to tell Doc about this accident too in 1955. Will he able to solve all...or...!? This movie is enjoyable for men and women of all ages I think. It is thrilling and dramatic with happy ending. I recommend you to watch it and sequels(2,3)."
09.06.2008,10.0,"My review of Robert Zemeckis's Back to the Future, This has to do with a teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and a scientist Dr Emmett Brown ""Doc"" (Christophor Lloyd) went back in time to 1955. Actually Marty was going back in time, because Doc was shot and he was already there in 1955. Things have changed around Hill Valley in 1955. Well there's a young George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson). Things go fine until Biff Tannen (Thomas Wilson) shows up. Now things turn creepy when Emmett Brown does not know Marty in the 50's. They have to get back to 1985 by a bolt of lightning, which it strikes at night. Now they have to get George and Lorraine to the school dance. Now Marty is prepared to back to 1985. Then Emmett was suspecting that Marty was supposed to go back, but he came back from the future. It's a absolute classic, and I would recommend watching this, especially on TV, or on the trilogy set on DVD (Which I have, but unfortunately, I only have the full frame version, I don't have the widescreen version of this, sorry) But it doesn't matter, you get the movie anyway. About the movie, well done special effects, great acting, and great directing from Robert Zemeckis.Back to the Future gets 10/10 stars"
08.06.2008,9.0,"Back To The Future (1985)Top 3 - 1985One of the greatest sci-fi/action/adventure/fantasy/comedy films of all time. I have seen very few other films that have provided the sheer enjoyment that Back To the Future provides so effortlessly.The ultimate story: Using a time-machine, visiting famous times, seeing life when your parents were your age and causing so space-time continuum problems.Michael J Fox is superb as Marty McFly with equal if not greater praise to Christopher Lloyd for his fantastic interpretation of Dr. Emmett Brown, the mad scientist who made the De Lorean the car which is a time machine.With a little help from Eine!Verdict - An instant classic, bound to be loved for many, many years to come.8.5/10"
05.06.2008,9.0,"This is one of my favorite movies ever!!! It has so much to offer: an innovative an d thoroughly thought through plot, the eighties, terribly good jokes, Marty McFly, and last but not least time-traveling. I especially love the skate-boarding scene where cool Marty McFly tries to escape Biff and his thugs who bully George McFly who is Marty McFly's father. It's really neat to compare the fashion styles of the eighties, the sixties and today's fashion. As a young boy I had to see this movie over and over. Today I can laugh about a lot of stuff I didn't get back then. Gotta see this one. Already, an all-time classic!! I do not give my hopes up to see a fourth part some day..."
21.05.2008,10.0,"I am a 11 year old fan of BTTF. It is a fact that this is the best of the series. And I agree with it. This is my 3rd favorite film ever. Well,this is my first day of being an online critic so I felt like I should start out with my top 10 favorite movies. Well, anyways, this is the best time travel film ever. If you have not seen it, Buy it. Most people have seen this but there are some people out there who have not seen it yet. I love this film a lot because I laugh at it, I can relate to this, and I want to be a time traveler. MPAA Rating: PG. My MPAA Rating:PG-13. Great movie. Everyone who hasn't seen it needs to see it now. Someday, I have the box set. I love these movies. If you hate them,then that is find but I will have a hard time understanding that.

17.05.2008,10.0,"Back to the future is surely in the list of the most entertaining movies ever made, you would not see the time pass.I Loved every minute of it especially when Micheal J Fox goes back to 1955 and meets his mother.Micheal j fox and Chritopher Lloyd are simply terrific in this movie brilliantly directed by Robert Zemeckis who made some of the most entertaining movies in film history .It stands as the best sci fi comedy movie ever made and captures the level to be listed in every list of top movies ever , 2 sequels followed which even captured the same level of this one but this one remains the best,although the whole trilogy is nothing short than hilarious."
14.05.2008,10.0,"My god. I saw this movie at the cinemas when i was 14 years old. And it Completely blew my mind. I can still remember my thoughts when I came out of the cinema, completely exhausted, and empty inside, because I WAS Marty Mcfly in the whole movie.I can not recommend this movie strongly enough. If i should rate all of the movies I have seen in my entire life (I'm 35), this would rise above them all, as a perfect 100% score. And I have seen them all..... I'm watching Back To The Future tonight again for the 498.time.. at least...My god. The PERFECT movie.... if i could marry a movie, it would be Back To The Future..."
08.04.2008,7.0,"The kind of comedy/adventure/sci-fi hybrid that the 1980s did very well, and which you just don't see anymore.""Back to the Future"" solidified Michael J. Fox as a bona fide movie star, and featured a deliriously wacky Christopher Lloyd playing a scientist who invents a time travel machine. Robert Zemeckis keeps things light and playful -- he's one of many directors (like Ron Howard, Steven Spielberg, etc.) who started out making enjoyable romps until he felt the need to become ""serious"" and started making movie crap like ""Forrest Gump."" I didn't fall in love with the ""Back to the Future"" series, but I see its appeal.Grade: B+"
03.04.2008,9.0,"Back To The Future is a great movie that has everything.A terrific story, memorable characters, great acting, dead-on satire, beautiful FX and great music. Every scene in this movie is a winner. Probably this movie works because it never takes itself seriously. From start to finish the movie contains an amazing wealth of visual gags (the giant guitar speaker, the DeLorean time machine), classic lines (""You can't have a Pepsi Free. You gotta pay for it."") and in-jokes (rocker Huey Lewis complaining that the music is too loud). The time travel logic, so hard to pull off, is done with great flair, suitable for any science fiction movie. Except this isn't a sci-fi film. It's a comedy with a heavy dose of social satire mixed in and it works on both levels.Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly a teenager who would rather play guitar than do anything else. He's friendly with the town's off-the-wall inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd.) Doc creates a time machine and Marty is accidentally transported back to the year 1955. There he meets a younger version of his parents (Crispin Glover and Leah Thompson) and has to arrange for them to meet so they will get married and have him.The role of Marty McFly was ideal for Michael J. Fox. His ability to play a teenager transferred perfectly from TV (Family Ties) to the big screen. Crispin Glover is terrific as Marty's father, George McFly. He has a dual role, as a teenager and an adult. Christopher Lloyd is almost over-the-top as the nutty inventor. Thomas Wilson is Biff, the bully who constantly torments George McFly.Other than Forrest Gump this is Robert Zemeckis's best movie. Kids and adults will appreciate it."
02.04.2008,10.0,"Michael J. Fox in the role that made him famous as Marty, a college kid, who is accidentally sent back in time into the 1950s with a time machine invented by Christopher Lloyd, in probably his most famous role as the odd professor.Stranded in the past, Marty has to find a way to return Back To The Future, and make sure that he doesn't alter history in a way that might actually change the time and place that he originally came from.Very well-structured, carefully thought-out mix of comedy and adventure which plays its premise to the full, right up to an incredibly tense and frantic finale.Excellent special effects and production design make this trip back in time totally believable; a fine cast and sure-footed direction are other essential highlights.First-rate escapist fare.A perfect 10 stars out of 10."
20.03.2008,10.0,"BTTF is a magical film that can be watched again and again and never tires. I first saw it when I was about 10 years old and it became an instant personal favourite, somewhat due to the fact that the ""future"" coincided with my own year of birth.Conceived by the highly talented duo of Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis (the two Bob's), it tells the story of a 1980s teenager who is accidentally transported back in time to the 1950s in a plutonium-powered DeLorean created by an oddball scientist. His brief trip back in time turns into a nightmare after he inadvertently prevents his parents from meeting and subsequently jeopardises his own existence. Working with the 1950s counterpart of the scientist who created the time-machine, he must find a way to make his parents fall in love and get back to the future.On the surface, the story seems rather simple and straightforward, but if you look deeper, you will find that this film has many complex layers, which make it an utterly brilliant piece of work.It is also full of coincidences. For instance, our time-travelling hero, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels from 1985 to 1955, with the latter been exactly 30 years in the past. There are countless other coincidences that are scattered throughout the film, many of which can be picked up after repeat viewings. Picking up and identifying new things can be quite fun.Get lost in time and enjoy the film!"
17.03.2008,10.0,"I first saw 'back to the future' with my dad when I was about seven years old. Now over eight years later I have seen the film hundreds of times and it is still one of my favourite movies.The film tells a simple story of teenager Marty (perfectly acted by Michael J Fox) who is accidentally sent back thirty years in time to when his parents were teenagers. His only hope of returning to his life in 1985 is his scientist friend 'Doc' Brown (also perfectly acted by Christopher Lloyd). In the meantime his teenage mother has formed a crush on him after he saved his father and again accidentally ruining what should have been the start of their relationship.If you haven't yet seen this movie 'WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???' The acting and casting is perfect, the directing, the special effects, absolutely everything in this movie is perfect. One of the funniest, most watchable movies ever created.10/10"
17.02.2008,7.0,"When this came out over 20 years ago, I thought It was solid entertainment with a clever story. It was a big hit, and spawned two sequels. I saw it at the theater and several times on VHS. Then, after an absence of time, I saw it again in the late '90s and was shocked to hear 11 blasphemes - a ridiculous amount for a comedy (and ""PG-rated,"" to boot).Also, the character ""Biff"" (Thomas Wilson) was so irritating to me (he must have done a good job acting) it also fun out of viewing. I could say the same about ""Marty's"" father (Crispin Glover), who was a disgusting wuss. I did enjoy seeing Lea Thompson in her prime: a very pretty woman, and there were still a lot of laughs in here. She and Christopher Lloyd's ""Emmet Brown"" are definitely fun to watch. Michael J. Fox became an even-bigger star, thanks to this movie.The mixture of humor, action, drama, special-effects, science-fiction, etc., all made this a film a lot of people enjoyed. Why they had to include all that ""language"" is a mystery to me, except that it's the twisted world of Hollywood."
06.01.2008,8.0,"In this entertaining sci-fi comedy, a young man is inadvertently sent back 30 years via a time machine (a Delorean car) and unwittingly interferes with the mating of his parents, thereby putting his future in jeopardy. The plot is silly and full of holes, but it is fun to watch. Most of the characters are stereotypes that seem to have stepped out of sitcoms. Fox became a star with this film and Thompson is good as his mother. This was an early success for the talented Zemeckis, who keeps the action moving at a fast clip. The scenes leading to the trip back to the future are very exiting and well executed. This film was a huge success and was followed by a couple of sequels."

27.12.2007,8.0,"The year is 1985 and Marty McFly is your everyday teenager, except for one problem. He is stuck in 1955. After his good friend Doc Emmett Brown is gunned down, Marty ends up sending the DeLorean back twenty years into the past. Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the future, but this is the least of Marty's problem. After accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence.This may not be one of the most complex time travel movie, but it is sure a lot of fun! I love time travel movies. Everything you've seen from an average time travel movie is seen here: Person goes to the past and if he changes anything, the future will change; but only this time, there are some problems with having a mother loving her son (actually falling in love with each other).Now this is one weird and wacky time travel movie. There are things that have been done in other time travel movies before (even theories made up by one of the characters) but there are also new and maybe not as original (as I hoped) things in here to enjoy and mess your mind around. But the main thing is try to not over complicate what is going on. Just have fun."
05.10.2007,9.0,"""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" This is a film where anything is possible and what every single person has once dreamt about.....embarking on time travel.This an enjoyable and satisfying film about a teenage boy (Marty) being forced to go back in time using the iconic flux capacitor invented by Emmet ""Doc"" Brown. While Marty is back in time he inavertely changes the future which includes him never existing.Not only is this a nostalgic snapshot of what the 50's used to be like, its also a vivid juxtaposition of time periods (50's and 80's). It has clever and slick references to the differences in the 50's to the 80's and how naive people were.Is this an epic masterpiece? No, but its a big achievement in cinema because it brings a lot of peoples impossible dreams alive. This is probably one of the greatest comedies ever and is definitely Micheal J fox's best film so far. 9/10 A must see"
09.09.2007,9.0,"Back to the Future was not expected to be what it became. Shot with an impossible schedule as Michael J Fox was committed to Family Ties, and made into a series of three films, 20 years on they remain fresh and entertaining (not even the nationality of the terrorists needs updating!).The plot, while it is original and cheeky, is based on a classic time travel plot, and could be expected to age fast. It is not the case, and it remains a solid family value entertainment... the sort of films you can expect your kids to watch over and over again. I suppose the whole skateboard and matchmaking your mum and dad must be part of the timeless magic of the script.So only one thing to do: buy a collector's three film box set and you'll know what sound investment means when they have been watched 20 times plus and your kids ask if they can watch it AGAIN."
25.07.2007,10.0,"I love this movie! I saw it for the first time in like 15 years, thinking that I've seen it enough and put it off for that long. Then it came on HBO and I was forced to watch it...I never realized how unbelievably fantastically wonderfully awesome this movie is! It's so funny and good and...just incredible! The story is just so well-thought and cleverly put together. The acting is great, the sets are perfect, heck I can't think of one bad thing to say about this film! It's going to be a classic forever, there's no doubt about it. It's *fabulous*. ;) Anyway, yeah. It's a really good movie. Best movie ever made in the history of movies...deserves a trillion / 10 stars. Absolutely amazing. Love it love it love it!"
20.07.2007,10.0,"""Back To The Future"" is one of 3 of my favorite movies of all times. I have the Trilogy on DVD and I've played the movie so many times, I know all the dialog. I also have the ""Honeymooners"" Classic 39 on DVD as well, so I couldn't help noticing one small error in the first ""Back To The Future."" As Marty sits at the dinner table on the Saturday evening of November 5th 1955, they're watching the Honeymooners episode, ""The Man From Space."" However, that episode didn't air until December 31st. of that year. The actual episode that aired on November 5th 1955, was ""The Sleepwalker."" An episode which I think would have worked just as well. I know,...Who Cares, right? Right!!!"
19.07.2007,10.0,"What makes a good comedy movie? Just lots of dumb, pointless humor and no real plot. But what makes a good movie? A film with every feature containing quality, even the humor. So to have a really good comedy movie, at least in my opinion, it has to have EFFECTIVE humor WITH a point behind it, mixed with a good plot, good acting, storyline, and have a realistic feeling behind it. In other words, the humor must be something believable and of the possible. And it must all blend seamlessly with the rest of the quality parts of the film. And we get all of that in Robert Zemeckis's classic science fiction/comedy film ""Back to the Future"". This is the kind of comedy film that I wish we would see more often. It's like ""Forrest Gump"", it takes a realistic approach to life and then just blends it with the humor so that the audience doesn't concentrate so much on just laughing, but also understanding the plot and characters just as they would with a serious film. And as soon as they're done laughing at the lifelike jokes, then they focus back on the rest of the film.One thing I notice about a lot of comedy films that teenagers in particular seem to cherish and love is that the humor is crude and oftentimes, disturbing. And I suppose that if ""Back to the Future"" was made for teenagers alone, then the humor would be exactly the same. In this film, there is a subplot which some might think would end up being just disturbing and agitating to the audience. But when you look at it, it's not at all uncomfortable to the viewers, but instead works out effectively by not concentrating so much on just getting an uproar out of people. Of course, there is lots of jokes in the movie, mostly because of comedian Christopher Lloyd, who is at his top notch in ""Back to the Future"" as well as ""Back to the Future 2"". Not as much in the third part of the series. But he is especially keen in the first entry of the famous trilogy. And once again, his character of Dr. Emmett Brown is goofy and funny, but also has the traits where if you bumped into a person like this on the street, you wouldn't just sit back and laugh like he was just a dumb comedy feature. The character seems like he could be a real person.""Back to the Future"" is a very great film. Not just as a comedy, but also as a science-fiction film. The explanations of the time machine aren't just thrown together as they are with many films. The time machine isn't just 'created' by the scientist and not explained how it works our what it takes. There is a fairly logical explanation, and maybe a theory, as to how time travel could be possible but it doesn't so so into depth to the point where only professors would understand what's going on. That's the thing about this film. Nothing just happens. There's an explanation and a point for everything. And that's what I like to see in all films. Whether they're serious of just plain funny. Or both."

Where is the spoof? Will they get Mr. Fox for one more time travel? I love the Delorean. I will do anything for one of those cars! Say hi to your mom for me...... Will anyone ever be this good? I hope that there is never a re-make. I would travel back to 1977 and see myself born. Will you see me or will there be a paradox. I want them to come out with a new video game for the Wii. Who is with me on this? I also want to challenge anyone in a trivia contest. Let's throw down!"
04.07.2007,9.0,"Back to the Future is probably one of the best motion pictures I've ever seen. I love the way time travel is somehow made real to me! The average time travel movie is surreal but, in this case, because of the way the story is told, I find it pretty real. One can almost start believing in time travel and all! I really enjoyed Marty McFly performing one of the (in my opinion...) best songs in human history, Johnny B. Goode. The dance is great, and the comment afterwards: ""I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it."" It is great to see Marty starting to understand his parents' choices better by knowing them as teenagers. It is always funny to see him make mistakes though: ""Dad"" becomes ""Dad, dad, daddy-o"", and so on.That's pretty much everything I have to say about Back to the Future..."
02.07.2007,9.0,"I first saw ""Back to the Future"" years ago, but it really didn't do much for me. I saw it again several years later, and don't recall thinking much of it during that viewing, either. However, after watching the highly acclaimed Robert Zemeckis movie again recently (this time a good few years after my last viewing, I believe), although I still can't exactly call it one of my favourite features, I now understand why it has such wide appeal! In 1985, Marty McFly is a teenager who is not exactly popular with his peers, but does have a girlfriend named Jennifer Parker. His best friend is Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, an oddball local scientist. One night, Marty meets Doc out in a parking lot, where he is to assist the scientist with his new invention, a time machine made by a car! To make the machine powerful enough, Doc has used plutonium, which he got from a terrorist group who were expecting him to make a bomb with it! Unfortunately, just as Doc is about to travel through time, the terrorists track him down and shoot him! They then go after Marty, who manages get away in Doc's machine, but ends up being transported to the year 1955, back when his parents were around his age! Eventually, he meets the Doc of that time and manages to figure out a way to get back to 1985 with his assistance. However, Marty also learns that he has altered history, and must somehow get his parents together in order to save his very existence! This movie may start out a tad sluggish, but for the vast majority of the approximate two hours that it runs for, it is consistently entertaining! Most of ""Back to the Future"" is very exciting, with a lot of action, and it also works reasonably well as a comedy, with quite a few laughs here and there. Basically, the main cast members all nothing less than reasonable in their performances (I haven't noticed any really bad ones during any of my several viewings). The most notable performance (one that's definitely MORE than reasonable) is that of Christopher Lloyd, who fits the role of Doc Brown very well. The movie wouldn't quite be the same without this character and his antics! For all those reasons, this first installment in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy is one fine accomplishment! Over two decades after the release of this sci-fi comedy, it remains extremely popular. It's current position in the IMDb Top 250 is obviously proof of that. No movie can please 100% of its viewers, but clearly, the majority of people who have seen ""Back to the Future"" at any point in the past 22 years have enjoyed it, and that's a lot of people, so the film deserves a lot of credit! If you usually like to see the sci-fi and comedy genres combined, and you haven't seen this particular combination of the two for any reason, I strongly suggest you watch it as soon as possible!"
26.05.2007,,"They don't make 'em like this anymore. Back to the Future is a brilliant film!This is a brilliant, politically incorrect teen comedy, written with blazing originality and off- beat irreverence.Told in a stylistically slick narrative that surprises and enlightens, with characters that are portrayed with staggering comedic timing and sometimes shocking depth. This will remain the pinnacle of Robert Zemickis' career. Though considered such an '80s classic, the movie is extremely timeless.Students today will find much to identify with in the always-fresh and touching ""unknown future"" themes. But the most identifiable element in the film is the farcically bureaucratic characters. In other words, there will always be McFly roaming the hallways in this modern environment. And as long as it stays that way, Back to the Future will remain one of the most entertaining, satirical, and accessible comedies around. 10/10"
16.05.2007,8.0,"Back to the Future is the kind of film for all ages. I have not come across many people who find this film to be stupid. A variety of ages, when asked, have told me they love the concept of the film, the story, the characters, etc etc. I agree with them whole heartedly. Back to the Future is one of those films I can go back to (no pun intended) again and again. It is a film that doesn't need brains to figure out, just watch and you'll enjoy it.Back to the Future follows the life of Marty McFly and his relationship with a crazy old scientist, Dr. Brown, who says he has discovered the secret to time travel. Due to odd circumstances Marty is sent back in time and the time machine (which is actually a buffed up DeLorean) breaks down, stranding him in the time when his parents were in high school. With the help of the younger Dr. Brown he must figure out a way to save his own existence when he messes up things between his parents and find a way to get 'back to the future'. Michael J. Fox is a great actor. He captures the spirit of a teenager though he was 24 when he did the film. He is the initiator of most of the jokes, though they don't come from his mouth. His inability to realize that he is in the past makes several awkward moments in the past, especially with the local bully and at a school dance. His performance is legendary in my book and one of the reasons I watch Back to the Future so often.Christopher Lloyd, I feel, is what made this film work. His eccentricity and his random proclamation of ""Great Scott!"" makes his character work so well with what he is use to portraying. A veteran actor of Lloyd's background was needed to make the film work. If a serious actor had been put in the role, the film would not have worked. His odd approach to the character made his character and acting the funniest bit of all in the film.The portrayal of 50's life is right on par. Marty's interaction with it is some of the funniest things I saw in the film. Crispen Glover gives a solid performance as Marty's father back in the 50's. What I find great about the film though is how you feel for every character. You really do feel for George McFly (Glover) as he struggles to woe the love of his life Lorraine. A rarity in comedy indeed. You want Marty to get back to the 80's and you want Biff to get decked the whole film. The script is solid, the acting is superb, and the laughs are numerous.4/5 Stars"
03.05.2007,10.0,"In my opinion, Back to the Future, along with its sequels, are the single most entertaining movies ever made. There are tons of gripping movies out there, but Back to the Future is a quality fun and edge of your seat film...totally deserving of its place on the Top 250. The flow of the movie, the characters who make it - everything is just awesome. The lines...""1.21 gigawatts!"" or anything about the Flux Capacitor never fails to make me smile.One of the best things about Back to the Future is that it doesn't try to be anything special. The movie was made by individuals who just wanted to give the public something to enjoy...and it was a hit and still remains one of my favorites today."
08.04.2007,9.0,"One things certain,this is one of the greatest science fiction comedy films ever. a true pleasure to watch from start to finish. I've watched many films like this and i must say this comes out on top, there are very little flaws and it truly stood the test of time for its amazing special effects. The acting was very impressive from both Michael j fox and Christopher Lloyd. they both played there parts exceptionally well and fitted their characters perfectly. The Music is also very good and will be very memorable in film history. finally i have to say i cant really point out any flaws and i find it hard to imagine that people wont enjoy this film. A true classic for sure and one to look out for if you haven't already seen."
25.03.2007,10.0,"I love sci-fi that is based in reality. By that I mean that you can test the logic defined by the rules set in the film, and it stands up from all angles. Most time travel movies break their rules somewhere. Sometimes it's forgivable, sometimes it's not. But Back to the Future (and its sequels) is as close as I've seen to the perfect logic in a time travel movie. The writers clearly thought this through from all aspects. They defined the rules of time travel that they were going to use (of which there are several to choose from) and they wrote the story around those rules, rather than just making a time travel movie and not thinking through the ramifications of what the characters do.This movie and its sequels remains to this day my absolutely favorite movie(s) of all time. All other time travel movies pale in comparison."
21.03.2007,8.0,"BACK TO THE FUTURE is a roller coaster ride of an adventure that firmly established Robert Zemeckis as a director to be reckoned with and officially made a movie star out of sitcom star Michael J. Fox. Fox replaced Eric Stolz in the role of Marty McFly, a misfit of a teenager whose friendship with a loopy inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) gets him into quite the pickle. The Doc has actually invented a time machine that transports Marty back to the year 1955, where he meets his parents as teenagers and must unite them romantically in order to exist and return to the year 1985. This film is expertly mounted thanks to detailed direction and a rock solid screenplay. Fox is energetic as Marty McFly and gets wonderful support from Lloyd as Doc Brown and from Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson as his parents. Kudos as well to Thomas F. Wilson, who scores as a perpetual bully in Marty's life. The movie is full of laughs, scares, and even a touch of genuine warmth here and there. If you've never seen it, treat yourself. Follwed by two sequels."
25.02.2007,10.0,"In my opinion this film is the best ever. Why you may ponder as you search aimlessly through the database that is IMDb.com. Why purely for its comedic value of course. Who can honestly say they didn't laugh when Marty McFly landed Biff in a pile of Manure or When he encounters Doc in 1955. And it is not just comedy alone which makes this film so enjoyable. It is also the unique insight it offers into a situation which we could never hope to experience, that of seeing our parents as teenagers. And so If your wondering why this film has achieved cult status, stop, simply pick up a copy and watch Marty and doc rev up the delorean to 88mph and see for yourself. You wont regret the experience. 27 years later no one has."
12.02.2007,9.0,I have seen this movie since I was an early teenager. This one of those films that I can watch over and over again. Every time I watch them I find out something new that I didn't see before. I even try to find the mistakes but I never can find them. I think that Michael J. Fox is a great actor and he did this part very well. He even did the part of his daughter pretty well(playing a girl). I would recommend this movie to anyone is see. All the other actors played their parts very well. I wish they would of continued the story of Marty and Jennifer. We do not know what happened to them. We just have to guess that they end up together. If I could meet Michael J. Fox I would ask him if he liked playing this part.
25.01.2007,10.0,"I don't usually comment on movies but on this movie I'll make an exception. The story starts with teenager Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox), a dedicated guitar player with a wonderful girlfriend (Claudia Wells). He however has a rather unusual family with his father (Crispin Glover) being a wimp, mother (Lea Thompson) an alcoholic, and brother and sister perhaps the most weird of the lot. We also find out that Marty has a rather unusual friend, Docter Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who has been working on a time travel mechanism for the past 30 years. We are not shown Doc Brown until about 15 minutes into the film, however he is referred to as a 'real nut case who is very dangerous' by his Principle Mr Strickland who simply hates Marty's guts. We are soon shown how the device works by the Doc and Marty accidentally transports himself back to 1955 when a group of terrorists arrive to ruin both their days. Marty finds his parents are of the same age and destroys the way they are supposed to meet and suddenly it is an uphill battle from there, but with the help of the Doc who is 30 years younger, they come up with a plan that could help get Marty home (probably should've mentioned the time machine runs off plutonium).This film is a lot of fun having both humour and lots of twists and turns throughout the entire film. Superb acting by Fox who was actually 22 years old playing a 17 yrs old teenager, however most of us wouldn't notice. Terrific acting by Lloyd, Glover and Thompson who had very unusual roles. Zemeckis's directing is top quality, especially the beginning with the many clocks which *hints* this is a movie on time travel. A very family movie for people of all tastes that will always be a classic in my books. 4.5/5"
18.01.2007,10.0,"This is the best movie ever in all of the time-travel stories.These back to the future films are my favorite films,i have watched them at least 10 times and i still enjoy them very much especially for the first one. Great story, remarkable screen shots and great performance of Christopher Llyod and of course Micheal J.Fox. I'll never forget the last scene which was very exciting.Actually this movie cause me and my friend Caglar to question our lives and also the possibility of time-travel for changing the things in our lives.But i'm still not sure if you can go past and change the time-line and affect the future events then go back to the that alternative future.As doc says the future hasn't been written and the things we did in our lives would make our future."
11.01.2007,10.0,"When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story."
10.01.2007,10.0,"I feel it is my personal responsibility to inform the world of this movie's brilliance. I have been in love with this movie ever since I was a kid and I still watch it regularly. It's such a fun story, and the plot is more in depth than most people realize. I swear I notice something interesting that I never noticed before every time I watch this movie. Anytime I talk to someone who hasn't seen it, I feel obligated to show it to them. The acting is superb; you'll fall in love with Doc Brown's eccentricity and wish you were as cool as Marty McFly. Overall this is a movie that will disappoint no one, regardless of your movie tastes; it has something for everyone."
07.01.2007,9.0,"This film is classic, and has stuck with me from childhood, and i am guaranteed to watch it again and again. The story line is tight, the idea original and the performance from all is amazing. Ranging from the stereotypical bully played by Thomas Wilson, to Marty and the similarities between him and his dad, played by Michael J Fox who at times, sums up a teenager precisely, but most of all the manic facial expressions and insane dialogue from Christohe Lloyd, who plays the mad Doc ""Einstein"" character with such vigour it just makes me smile when he's in the shot, let alone doing something. A great performance by Lloyd capped this film off for me as being one of the best i've seen.But the film itself is great stuff too...!"
07.01.2007,10.0,"Why is ""Back to the Future"" my favorite movie from 1985? Because that was the year I was born! I'll be turning 22 this year, as will this film. Robert Zemeckis has had an astounding career over the last half-century, with other hits including ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) and ""Cast Away"" (2000). But his best will always be ""Back to the Future,"" at least to me. In 1985, wacky, frizzy-haired scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents time travel, that is he builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. A series of harrowing events forces wise-cracking teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to take the DeLorean for a test drive through time, 30 years back to 1955, before he was even born. Never mind the scientific improbabilities and paradoxes present in the script, but McFly must find a way back to '85, before his future is erased by events in the present. You see, he has inadvertently altered the course of events that will lead to his then-teenage parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) meeting and falling in love, and now he must try to get them together with a young Doc Brown's help while also facing off against Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the local tough. ""Back to the Future"" remains a comedy classic, due largely to its mix of special effects fantasy and laugh-out loud moments. The performances are excellent, especially from Fox, who is one of my favorite actors and I do wish him well in the future with his fight against Parkinson's Disease.10/10"
06.01.2007,8.0,"I've seen this movie about 100 times, and I never get tired of it. It has great humor and a great plot line. Just the time traveling in the movie intrigues me. Michael J. Fox does an excellent job as Marty Mcfly and Christopher Lloyd does an excellent job as Doc Brown. There isn't a single bad actor in the film ( well, maybe one, though I haven't looked for him/her). The only bad thing about this film is the swearing. I love this film, but there is just a bit too much swearing for my taste. It wouldn't be as bad if there was only a little, but there is a TON! I mean, come on! They're not even necessary to the film and make me cringe every time I hear them. There are other things that they can say. All in all, if you like movies with good actors, good humor (mostly ) and good plot points and twists, then this is the movie for you. I recommend the whole Trilogy! 8/10 ( -2 for swearing )"
05.01.2007,10.0,I really loved this film. The first time I saw it was on the t.v a while ago. The 2nd and 3rd film are excellent as well. They are all incredibly clever and the cast is fantastic. If you want to see this film I recommend you buy it on DVD as its only around £3.99! Or if you like all the films read the P.S bit at the end of this comment to find out where to get it!It film revolves around Marty (Michael J Fox) going back to 1955 and meeting his dad George McFly( Crispin Glover). Marty's mum ( Lea Thompson) ends up falling in love with Marty when he saves his dad from getting hit by a tree. Its then up to Marty to get his mum and dad back together before its to late!P.S: I got the trilogy DVD box set for £14.99! WOW! from HMV!
05.01.2007,10.0,"Now, I haven't actually seen this movie yet, but it sounds absolutely amazing. I mean, a boy of the eighties traveling thirty years back in time and meeting his parents as teenagers? FANTASTIC!!! What I wouldn't give to travel through time at will! The whole 'Darth Vader from planet Vulcan' joke sounds pretty funny too. And two sequels?! Wow! And I thought this movie was cool! It still is, but, you know? I would really like to see this movie, so I will see if I can catch it on T.V. I would definitely recommend this movie to Sci-Fi fans of any age. It has a great plot, and some funny quotes, sounds like. I would say it is at least worth a look."
28.12.2006,10.0,"Run Marty Run is a euphemism for the loss of Marty's integrity. Marty was doing badly in school and doc did not know what to do about it. Especially in math class, Marty was doing very badly. And doc loved Marty and did not know what to do about it. So he created the time machine so that Marty would learn how to count better and he did not want to hurt Marty's feelings by telling him that he knew how badly he was doing in math class. Doc had covert intelligence reports on how Marty was doing in school. So the time machine was just a way to teach Marty how to count better without hurting Marty's feelings. ""Run Marty Run!!!"" is supposed to become colloquial English for when somebody has done something wrong."
03.12.2006,9.0,"HAve you ever had a movie experience from years before(let's use as an arbitrary number,five years or more)that was so vivid,so exhilarating that you could recall what day,time and even things as seemingly easy to forget as the smell and tastes of the popcorn and soda you had at the movie?For me,that was this movie,and I recall seeing it on a Sunday afternoon in July,1985. The noise and visuals were so electric that I enjoyed this film immensely. My only regret about the experience was that I didn't get a chance to redeem the ""Free Pepsi with purchase of large popcorn""discount coupons they were giving out that day!In a pleasant,average California suburb,ordinary teenager MArty McFly(Michael J.Fox,who was a youngish 24 when he filmed this) dreams of being a rock guitarist as he works his way through school,helping out brilliant-but-fringe local scientist Dr.Emmitt Brown(Christopher Lloyd,adding to his wide range of characters). When an unforeseen crisis interrupts Doc Brown's breakthrough time-machine revelation,MArty is thrust into the machine and becomes the unwitting first participant in time-travel. As if that weren't harrowing enough,he's just found a way to break up his younger parents BEFORE they met and now he has to feverishly find some way to get them back together,lest he and his sibs will never be born.If you can suspend some level of disbelief while watching this(and,really,when SHOULDN'T you suspend some disbelief when watching Spielberg/Lucas/Zemekis style of sci-fi films?),this film is as smooth as silk and one fun ride! Besides Fox and Lloyd,Crispin Glover(lovably strange and pathetic as Marty's once and future dad,George),Lea Thompson(cute and vapid as once and future mom Lorraine)and Thomas Wilson(thick-headed bully Biff,who is a lost treasure here,too) are excellent in fleshing out the characters that stick in one's mind regarding this film. Heck,Old MAn Peabody,Goldie Wilson,Jennifer PArker,MArvin Berry(cousin of Chuck)and the persistently bald and serious-as-heart-attack high school principal all add their own flairs in this movies persona. Robert Zemekis parlayed his ""Romancing the Stone"" success to create an even larger-than-life action-fantasy-comedy,with help from plenty of sight and sound FX and a hugely energetic soundtrack anchored by Huey Lewis and the News(remember them?). This film isn't just a renter,this is a keeper! Most people with a sense of fun who long for the eighties movies that accented style over dark or haunting substance should definitely buy this one,tape or DVD."
03.12.2006,8.0,"There aren't too many time travel movies around, mainly because ""The Time Machine,"" ""The Time Travelers"" and ""Time After Time"" films pretty much covered the subject. Then ""Star Trek"" used up the premise in its TV episodes and films, and there was even that ""Time Tunnel"" TV series in the mid-sixties. One option was to do such a movie with humor, pointing out the potentially absurd ramifications of traveling to your own past. So the main character of Marty McFly (Fox) ends up meeting his own parents when they were his age. Though this is a relatively tame comedy as far as teenage comedies of the eighties, there is the risky Oedipal element of Marty's own mother having the hots for him. This concept is then tossed aside near the end when, in a rather lame scene, his mom stops her advances because she suddenly feels like she's kissing her own brother. Disney should've went with this after all - it's possibly the least offensive picture of the decade and probably also explains its huge popularity - everyone could enjoy it.What elevates this above the common film are a few things: Glover's performance as Marty's father, both in younger & older incarnations, is deliriously eccentric; where everyone else is kind of in TV-movie mode, he's off in his own zone and hard to forget. There's an energy to the entire story thrust (from director Zemeckis), helped by Fox, who always seems anxious about something. The concept of time travel itself gets a clever redux here; we find out you can actually change reality in the present by your actions in the past - there's no mention of creating a parallel universe, for example. The ending is pretty strong, throwing in an extra whammy when we think things are over and everything is back to exactly the way it was. And it's very entertaining to watch Marty explore the fifties - we see through his eyes - the culture shock and making various connections between the older and new decades is a nice routine. There were also a couple of wildly funny moments involving Marty dressed up as an alien from outer space."
01.12.2006,10.0,"I just asked my friend that I'm speaking with through instant messenger if he had ever seen ""Back to the Future"" and he said ""Yeah, who hasn't?"", sadly, I never had the opportunity until tonite and he called me a failure as a movie buff, well, at least I've seen the movies now! Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.10/10"
28.11.2006,10.0,"Marty McFly, a guy with a girl, best friends with a crazy scientist, who could ask for a better life? Marty is a lucky person outside of the house. His friend, Doc (Doctor Emmett Brown), has told Marty that he has succeeded in his latest experiment. Marty meets him late at night and finds out that the Doc has made an actual time machine! Marty goes back to the past, 30 years before, and accidentally meets his mom and dad, 30 years younger. His dad, a Peeping Tom, his mom, a girl who has nothing in her head but love dust, and the Doc, the same old nuts and crazy. You can watch the rest. Back to the Future is a hilarious classic that everybody will enjoy. It's fun, funny and also very, very romantic that will leave you backing up on your seat. See this movie."
11.11.2006,10.0,"I watched this movie for the first time when I was like 7 or 8 years old, and it captured med instantly. The home-made ""garage-build"" high tech time-machine, that is in fact build into a DeLorean - a cool legendary sports-car of the 1980's, are simply stunningly awesome for young people, and if you are not young any more, well then you will be during the movie. The great story, the action-packed adventure, and most important; the extreme caution of following rules of time-travel and the creativity of the countless details in the three movies - along with the great cast of sympathetic and funny actors - simply makes this trilogy a must see adventure for people of all ages. I am now 27 years old, and I still watch the movies at least once or twice a year, and I still find myself observing new details that I haven't noticed before. This really need a re-release on the big screen in my opinion! (maybe with some remastering)"
10.11.2006,10.0,"Michael J Fox.....what an actor.this film had been around for ages before i got to watch it,which was only 4 years ago on a DVD box set i got for Christmas when i was 18.as soon as i got through the first film i felt like this was the best film trilogy's i will ever watch.so i watched them back to back and said to myself this is going to be my all time favourite film trilogy.I've never got bored even though I've watched the films tons of times.brilliant acting by all the cast and superb parts of the film that will always be remembered.i couldn't think of a better childhood film for all the family to watch.you fall in love with it instantly.Hands up to Robert Zemekis and Steven Spielberg on this one!"
19.10.2006,10.0,"Saw this movie last time at the age of 8....now i'm 27 years old!I had so much fun watching the whole trilogy again..even more like with the whole bunch of American movies i've been watching this year, just bought the DVD-Box with all three parts & it's AWESOME to watch these ones again!! Even more awesome like the first time i went to the movies. And I've been watching all 3 of 'em in a row.. HILARIOUS!! THIS IS Hollywood at its best! And in one thing i'm sure: a 4th part could never be done without Michael J. Fox..and never with. When you see this movie you think he never seems to get old. he could even play a teenager 10 years after finishing the 1st part! But for some reason some of the most gorgeous human beings have to get an illness that can't be cured... this fact is disgusting but you can't even do anything against it - what a pity...this movie is a part of Hollywood-History!!!"
09.10.2006,10.0,"This is truly a classic, back when special effects looked realistic rather than impressive. I have always been fascinated by time travel and this movie demonstrates it to the full. If you're interested in time travel you will not get bored of this film! Oh and it's sequels are also excellent (although I like to think of it as one huge movie). Best trilogy ever in my opinion.Not only is this a fantasy sci-fi, but also an adventure with comedic value. Tom Wilson known for his comedic roles (eg. wing commander series) does an excellent job of portraying Biff. In fact all the actors do an amazing job especially considering they all play multiple roles in different time-lines and realities. If you haven't already seen it, give it a try. 10/10 from me."
15.09.2006,9.0,"Much has been written about his hugely entertaining film. I just want to emphasis a few points: -The script is one of the best I've ever seen. Four, count them, FOUR climaxes! The pacing of the film is so delicately balanced, the last 30 minutes will leave you breathless. Humor, action, romance, it's all there. A really well written script.-A GREAT and under-rated score. Just try to get the ""Back to the Future"" theme out of your head after a viewing. Throw in a couple of Huey Lewis songs which perfectly fit the film's mid-80's roots, AND MJF's rendition of ""Johnny B Goode"", and you've got a soundtrack worth purchasing.-Hard to believe this movie is 26 years old. I just bought it and it has aged extremely well.A valuable addition to anyone's DVD library."
22.08.2006,9.0,"Time travel is a difficult subject, but it's still used often in movies. Usually there's major plot holes, and there's some in this film too. But this is such a well-made movie that it's easy to forget the oddities in plot and just have a fun time. The character's in this movie are maybe it's major weakness, they are very one dimensional. But some characters, like Doc and Michael J. Fox's character Marty, are so good that it overcomes the weaknesses.The film was continued with two sequels, neither of which are as good as the first, but they're not bad either. As a kid, I was much more interested in the future than the past that this first film deals with, and thought the second film was better. But now looking at them objectively, it's clear that this first film is the best. Overall it's a very enjoyable trilogy."
16.08.2006,10.0,"BTTF trilogy is a timeless movie series. This is nothing new everyone knows this. It is 1 of 2 movie series I can watch and rewatch and find it a complete almost flawless piece of storytelling - the other being Lord Of The Rings.That being said I would like to see the effects digitized in BTTF. Digital effects are infinitely better than analog ones - and the addition of such in BTTF would only further render timeless these films. I am a bit discouraged that Zemeckis hasn't done such already. I would want my pieces of art to be state-of-the-art and maintained forever onwards. George Lucas knows this and I respect him proportionately for such (though I think Episodes 4-6 of Star Wars need a lot of work).Anyway, back to BTTF. Watch it and enjoy it. Hopefully we'll get another trilogy soon of BTTF. Maybe yes, maybe no. They'll still be great classics regardless. The only regret is that Crispin Glover out of his arrogance and naivete didn't stick around for all 3."
16.08.2006,10.0,"Back to the Future is probably the best and quintessential time traveling movie ever made. You can't go far without someone spouting out its memorable dialogue and imitating its wonderful characters. Now that it's over twenty years old, Back to the Future is entertaining a whole new generation.It has a simple enough story that involves a teenager who longs for a better life and the crazy scientist friend who builds a time machine. When the scientist's unveiling of a time machine made out of a DeLorean goes awry, the teenager ends up accidentally going back in time thirty years. While he's there he sees all of the people he knows from 1985, except they're now thirty years younger.A genius story like that creates an excellent movie and a star making performance by Michael J. Fox as the teenager. The highlight of this movie comes from the scientist played by Christopher Lloyd. His whacky antics were perfect for the role and made the character of Doc Brown immediately come to life.Some viewers today may think that an '80s movie that ends up becoming a '50s movie won't be for them. Those people are sorely mistaken, because if you're looking for a wild ride that will keep you entertained and in stitches, look no further. Back to the Future has everything you crave."
13.08.2006,8.0,"If any film endeared MICHAEL J. FOX to movie audiences, it was BACK TO THE FUTURE ('85). He was an inspired choice to play Marty McFly, who meets up with crazy wizard scientist Doc Brown (CHRISTOPHER LLOYD) and finds himself living in small-town USA circa 1955 where he discovers that he must arrange a match between his parents who haven't yet connected.Lloyd plays Doc with wild-eyed enthusiasm, a stroke of genius for such an over-the-top kind of role. Completely in harmony with him is CRISPIN GLOVER as Marty's nerdy father, a joy to watch as he completely becomes this character. Then too, an added source of enjoyment is LEAH THOMPSON as Marty's mother/girlfriend who takes part in some of the most innocently funny ""incest"" routines ever--and somehow, none of it manages to offend. It's all played for laughs and all of it works.Discovering that another actor originally started the Marty role and was then tossed aside (he was too intense and felt uncomfortable in the role), it's a wise decision that found MICHAEL J. FOX landing the role and keeping the whole story fresh, funny and innocent. He's an actor who tells you with his whole body what he is thinking--and his expressive face gets quite a workout when the plot thickens.My favorite time travel movie has the wildest climax imaginable, all very clever and full of inventive surprises. Don't miss this one.And last but not least: Thomas F. Wilson makes a great ""Biff"", the town bully whose mere physical presence threatens to dominate many a scene.All of the action is directed at a frantic pace by Robert Zemeckis."
10.08.2006,10.0,"Well i first laid eyes upon Back to the Future when i was only a small boy. Straight away i was mesmirised. It was the first film that i watched over and over again and then the second one came out and then a third. Robert Zemeckis has done a great job on this picture, the script is solid and the acting is incredible from both ""Marty"" and ""Doc."" The way that all the films tie into each other is perfect scripting. A Great film for the family, the kid, the teenager or the geeky adult, it is a good example of a Perfect film. This film is to this day the one of the best films I've ever seen and will continue to love it over the years."
04.08.2006,,"In 1985 teenager Marty McFly is a bit of an outcast and spends his evenings hanging out with eccentric professor Doc Brown and his various crazy and failed inventions. However when Doc asks Marty to meet him late one night in a mall parking lot, he learns that Doc has invented a working time travel system and inserted it into a DeLorean. Much to Doc's joy and Marty's surprise the machine works on its test run and Doc is all set to be the first man to travel in time when he is killed by the terrorist group who stole plutonium for him with the impression he was making them a bomb. Marty flees in the DeLorean but accidentally winds up back in 1955. Back there he convinces Doc to help him out and come up with a way of getting him back to the future. However the problem of no plutonium appears small when Marty changes the past and stops his parents meeting and falling in love.In its own way this is a classic film that delivers the goods in the same way as Frank Capra's films does although I can understand why for some it doesn't hold quite the same appeal. The plot seems complex as it involves time travel and such but it is deceptively simple and is a clever mix of sci-fi and romantic comedy that is as light and enjoyable as you could hope for. It never makes fun of itself but it never takes itself too seriously and by doing this it pitches it just perfectly. The narrative may be light but it is consistently engaging whether it is the time travel aspect or the relationships. It isn't perfect and it isn't the deepest of films but it is effortlessly a lot of fun and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.The cast are roundly great and are a big part of the film being as light and fun as it is. For my money this is Fox's best all-round performance and he plays the clean-cut American teenager really well bringing energy to the character. Of course Lloyd's performance dominates the film by its sheer colour and energy, making him the most memorable character of the piece. Thompson and Glover (two people who still look young twenty years later damn them) are both good in their roles and work well together and individually to make their part of the narrative match up to the (superficially) more appealing sci-fi stuff. Zemeckis directs with an eye for a memorable shot and visually his film matches the style and vitality of the narrative.Overall a very good film that is every bit as pleasing as the Frank Capra feel-good films that are held up as classics. Whether this film is a classic is as much up for debate as those films' classic status but it isn't really a debate that means a lot to me. What matters is that the film is engaging and entertaining, which it consistently is. It glides through a slick plot and I always enjoy it when I revisit it. Well worth taking a look if you are after a great piece of family fun."
24.07.2006,10.0,"This movie is excellent for children and adults of all ages. I would highly recommend this film for any family that have children of any age group.Michael J.(Andrew)Fox was an excellent choice for 'Marty' and Christopher Lloyd was excellent for 'Doc'. Good job guys. I definitely give this movie a 10 and put it in my top five favorite movies.If I could go back in time I would Like to Know how my mom and dad really met. I would go back to the old west and trace some family branches down. Mr.Zemickis did an outstanding job as did Mr. Gale and Producer Neil Canton, good job guys."
11.07.2006,10.0,"This movie is simply amazing to me. It has something to offer for everyone. It's funny, it's a good plot, and there's a time machine! And i believe the way the trilogy is structured is amazing. Robert Zemeckis closes out the first movie with a completed story and just begins the next one in a way. I think this is much better than what Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest, where too many stories are unfinished. The story line in Back to the Future is very thrilling. I don't think anything compares to this movie in its time era of 1985 where many special effects are used, and it is much different then a lot of the movies out. It was definitely next generation movies, much like the orig"
03.07.2006,7.0,"I am very confused because in the ""cast away"" Zemeckis have made a film that believes in the destiny that is programmed by god but in this movie the doctor have been survived after he had died because of the notes from Marty and the destiny has been changed. what do you think because of i had seen cast away before this , i expect in the meanwhile of watching movie that the doctor will read the message of Marty in 1955 , but any way he will die because this is the destiny and i was so confused after seeing the doctor alive . in the cast away Tom Hanks was a on time man and because of an accident he casted away from civil and he had a new believe that all things are not in his hands and someone from ""up"" is programming for his life and at the end of film , when he was in the road he was at a four way road and he did not know to go from which way and the sight of camera was from ""up"" that seems Zemeckis is showing us someone in ""up"".do you think that the believes of Zemeckis have been changed or something else?"
01.07.2006,9.0,"Suspend your disbelief in the mind-bending time-traveling premise; set aside the ultra-modern DeLorean (which still looks way ahead of our time 20 years later); peel back the 80s versus 50s clashing culture references; look past the extremely well-played cast of stock characters (the dashing, adventurous Marty, freaky fitful Doc, bullying Biff, timid pining George); mute the magnificent musical score; and strip away the splendid special effects (esp. the enduring parallel flame trails) and you have, in my opinion, the centerpiece and finest component of the movie--its superbly arranged plot. Movies tell stories. Stories have conflicts and problems that characters have to overcome. Back to the Future's plot is fantastic mix of interwoven conflicts. There are the character problems--Doc's dilemma about the morality of his scientific endeavors; McFly's family discord; Marty's growing pains. There are major plot problems--Doc's quest to test his machine; Marty getting stuck in time and trying to reconstitute his family. And then the film weaves in a myriad of subplots and little problems. The last half-hour of the movie throws one obstacle after another as Marty out of the locked school, fights off Biff, takes center stage, overcomes the downed cable, and still manages to get back in time to save Doc. Take the intricate plot and throw in all the other fine elements, and we've got a movie that keeps the viewer at the edge of the seat all the way up to 88mph. Then, with the denouement of the story, every the conflicts is resolved. There are no loose ends. There are no extraneous characters; everyone with a problem has it fixed by the end. The complete closure leaves a hook for the next episode. The special effects fit nicely within the story and do not overwhelm it (unlike so many films nowadays). Same for the music. At the end of the day, Back to the Future is a great story that leaves the viewer with plenty of plot to digest. Best appreciated over several viewings."
24.06.2006,10.0,"I recently have been collecting movies and one I constantly come back to is Back To The Future. The nostalgic feel of the movie with its contemporary portions set the stage for this film that you will enjoy watching over and over again. The casting was fantastic, the scripts well done, and the pacing excellent. Throughout our generation and those next we will all search for that flux capacitor that will show us what has made great movies in the past and find this title begging to be watched and replicated.Truly this movie deserves its ranking in the top 250 movies and possibly one higher than 125. So put on an old t-shirt, pop some corn, get back in that comfortable recliner and put on this classic that will surely shoot to the top of your favorites list."
24.06.2006,10.0,"SEE ""BACK TO THE FUTURE"". I know I opened 2 of my comments like this so far, but I say this for a good reason. If your child says ""It's too boyish."", ""It sounds boring."", or some other kind of whine or nasty comment, MAKE them see it. I even said I wouldn't like it! I said it with ""Star Wars"" too! Then my Dad FORCED me to see it, and now it's his fault I enjoyed these movies from start to finish. I'm sure you're child will be overjoyed with these movies too. If your a kid or teenager, take it from a 9-year-old, you'll adore it. If you came here looking for a plot line, sorry! In my opinion, one little hint at the movie could destroy one of the surprises, making the goodness of the plot crumble before your very eyes!!! That was a little too dramatic, but who cares! It's still a good movie, and you understood that. All in all, this is a terrific trilogy, which the world will cherish forevermore. 'Nuff Said!"
29.05.2006,8.0,"This movie was THE movie of the summer of 85. To this day, the film plays very well. I love watching the film for all the fantastic performances that are here. Fox is perfect as Marty, Lloyd is excellent as Doc. Glover is fantastically wormy as George, Leah Thompson is equal parts innocent and sexy as Lorain and Thomas Wilson is the epitome of the class bully.This is one of those movies that will continue to play on and on with so many generations because of the timeless themes that are excellent combined in a wonderful ensemble set of actors. Even though I own this movie on DVD, every time it comes on TV I stop and watch it and remember back to the summer of 85 when I first watched it and smile the whole time."
15.04.2006,10.0,"I have no problem giving this movie a 10 out of 10. Exuberant, bursting with inventiveness, this movie is a joy. Marty MckFly is a great character, and the whole movie is done so well. Where are these movies nowadays? This may be my favourite Robert Zemeckis movie. And what a great career move for Michael J. Fox. He almost didn't get the gig; Eric Stoltz was almost cast instead. Flying Delorians and Flux Capacitors, Lightning Rods and Chuck Barry, an incestuous kiss and a disorderly scientist, elaborate inventions/models and pretty girls--1980's fun, indeed idiosyncratically 80's while also transcending cultural specificity...those lacking a sensibility for material from that decade will still find nothing to complain about in this happy exuberant adventure story."
15.04.2006,10.0,"If someone remember who play (i mean the artist) the rock n roll song that martin McFly (Micheal J Fox) plays on their father graduation on the past Í'd like to know who's the artist please:) THX See ya Looks like i need to write 10 lines of text to submit this comment so i just going to write like a big fat retard.hello people I'm Randy and i Would like to know what's the name of the song or who is the artist please if you know please let me know or send me an e-mail to: hernan_cky@hotmail.com, if you do i will kiss you 2 times until you just hate me and kill me.Wow there you go 10 line yay actually 11 ---- Adios Amigos"
09.04.2006,10.0,"This was a really good movie! It had a very good storyline to it and I was just amazed.When I was younger, I used to think this movie was boring because I didn't quite understand it. But now that I've seen it again, I loved it! I saw Back to the Future parts 1 2 & 3 on TV. It was so good, that I bought the 3 Disc DVD of them. My favorite is Back to the Future Part 2 (It's on my top 5 list), but part 1 and 3 are very good as well.You will not be disappointed if you take the time to watch it. It's a really good movie and I'm not surprised that it made the top 250 list.10 stars out of 10"
08.04.2006,9.0,"How do you review one of the best, most famous comedies of all time? What is there that hasn't already been said? I suppose I could comment on how amazingly well-written the plot is, how everything fits together perfectly and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Or, I could mention how hilarious it is; the subtle jokes like Lone Pine Mall, the absurdity of some of the characters, the expression on Crispin Glover's face. Perhaps I could say how incredible the effects are, and say how great it is that they still hold up today. After that, I could say something about how these are the characters that Micheal J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd will always be remembered for. That would link in to the fun 80's soundtrack. Then I could end the review by saying how much I love the ending, how it almost makes you want to grab the sequel of the shelf right away. Oh well, I guess it's all been said before...9/10"
06.04.2006,10.0,"Wow, this movie had it all! It has an excellent comedic script, an extremely original science fiction and adventure plot, great suspense near the finale of the movie, very cool action sequences, a musical number and a romance subplot.In this classic comedy, Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a 17-year-old from Hill Valley, California. He is a friend with Dr. Emmet Brown or ""Doc"" (Christopher Lloyd), a mad scientist who invented a time-machine out of a DeLorean. When they are testing it out for the first time, Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955. He bumps into his teenage parents, before they are married, and by chance, his mother starts to like Marty and wants to go out with him. He then meets up with a younger Doc who helps him to try and make his parents fall in love with each other or else Marty won't be born and have him go back to 1985, the year he was originally from.The characters are excellent. I loved the character development and how Marty made everyone change for the better. It put a smile to my face seeing the impact that he had on everyone else. Marty and Doc have excellent chemistry and everyone in it had an excellent performance. I preferred Crispin Glover's performance as Marty's father, George McFly. His total nerdiness just made me crack up when he spoke.The script is also one of my all-time favourite screenplays. The humor is very clever and I loved the many one-liners. The plot is absolutely brilliant. It was truly one-of-a-kind and it made me think deeply of the concept of time travel and it kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the movie. I cannot find a single flaw in this great feel-good movie. They couldn't have made it better. Out of the hundreds of movies I've seen, this is the most fun I had watching a film.I rarely give out perfect scores but for Back to the Future, my rating is a 10/10, I could not recommend it more. This a great movie to watch if you want to have fun!"
04.04.2006,10.0,"You could rank Back To The Future on an all-time list of best movies for its special effects, and its in-depth exploration of time-travel in what almost seems plausible. I'm sure the physics professors could find fault with a few things, but the ""pop physics"" lesson we get to justify the plot is sufficient. This, however, would only make Back To The Future a great film. What makes it a REALLY GREAT film, however, is the ""buddy film"" aspect, or the amazingly close friendship that Marty and Doc have. Their level of trust and reliance upon each other is phenomenal. We are lucky if we ever have a friend like that, and this is what makes the movie memorable.For those who just got here in a time machine, the plot has typical high-schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), whose father George (Crispin Glover) is bullied by Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), rejected high-school suitor of Marty's mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson). George is a Walter Mitty type who never stands up for himself, and this sickens Marty, who seeks refuge with his girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells and later Elizabeth Shue), and the crazy, independently wealthy scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd). School is no refuge for Marty, however, as the ""evil"" principal Mr. Strickland thinks he is a ""no good slacker."" Marty tries out for the battle of the bands, and Huey Lewis passes amusing judgment on him.Doc invites Marty to film his time-travel experiment, by sending his dog, Einstein, a minute into the future. The time machine itself could have gotten a Best Supporting Actor Oscar itself, as it was a souped-up DeLorean (the brainchild of John DeLorean, who had recently been acquitted of cocaine trafficking that was ruled government entrapment of a vulnerable man about to lose his business). Doc had figured out that if he got the DeLorean to 88 mph while creating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity, the car would travel through time. He never made clear how he pinpointed the destinations, but there was a console in the car that needed only to be set.The time-travel experiment is a success, but Marty soon learns (as gunmen approach) that Doc had gotten the plutonium necessary to generate the time travel had been stolen from Libyan terrorists who were out for revenge. They ""kill"" the Doc (who returns for II and III of this series, so draw your own conclusions), and Marty must escape their wrath in the DeLorean. To elude the Libyans, he floors the car, it hits 88 mph, and the next thing you know, Marty is back in 1955 and the movie ""begins."" Marty gets to see the ""romance"" between his parents develop, and he gets to compare their actual behavior with how they say things were, with predictable consequences. Marty looks up the Doc, who quickly realizes he is genuine, and blends into Hill Valley society. Marty then alters the future inadvertently, and he must repair his wrinkle before the key moment in his parents' hooking up, and then he has to find his way ""back to the future,"" something which will not be easy and which he will only have one chance to do.Marty needs Doc to accomplish his mission, but Doc also needs Marty, because otherwise he would be the proverbial ""tree falling in the forest"" with no one there to hear him. The film develops the buddy plot to perfection, and handles the time travel humorously and in the true tradition of fantasy films, doing the best they can to be technically accurate, but staying focused on the human side of the story in a way that will leave audiences of all ages satisfied.No DVD collection is complete without this film."
15.03.2006,8.0,"This is a great fun movie, the best of the time travel genre, other than the more serious Star Trek themes.It's the wild and zany tale of 17 year old Marty McFly (that can't be a real last name, surely?) who teams up with your typical mad scientist and inventor of time travel, Doc Brown, resulting in Marty going back in time to 1955 and maybe even preventing his parents from meeting. Obviously something to be avoided at all costs if you'd like to be born.The plot twists, quirks, and spins are too numerous to delve into here, but they'll keep you riveted to your seat and laughing your head off. The lead actors are both wonderful in their roles... the always incredible Michael J. Fox as Marty, and Christopher Lloyd suitably crazy as the crackpot time travel scientist. He ('the Doc', as Marty calls him) is just so wonderfully nutty and wacky, and what I most remember from this movie. The whole thing's absolutely tremendous fun for all ages, lots of both action adventure and humor, the very essence of ridiculous. It's a real blast INTO the past."
21.02.2006,10.0,"I love the ""Back to the Future"" movies so much! These movies are a part of my life. In fact, I know about 99.9% of just about everything to memory! Plus, every time I watch these movies, I always find something new, interesting, or something that never really caught on to me before! That is how much I love ""Back to the Future."" I like part one because this is where it all begins. The beginning part with the dog feeder (the robotic arm, electric can opener, and a very funny whirring noise) and quite possibly the biggest amp in the history of the universe with that weird, rising ethereal hum got me on the floor, not only laughing, but imitating that part of the film, too! What about everything in Marty's house, from the TV playing ""The Honeymooners"" rerun to that ugly Panasonic clock radio? Priceless! Ooh, don't forget the JCPenney lot of the mall (which will remain unnamed because I'm not turning on the spoiler alert for this review) with the van and the DeLorean time machine coming out! Just watch this movie for more stuff! Oh, and to let y'all know: I've seen the three movies on DVD and I love them very, very much!"
19.02.2006,10.0,"Fans of scifi and comedy will love this movie. Here you have a young slacker named Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) who meets this crackpot scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd) who builds a time machine out of a DeLorean: America's Flop Car that'll remain memorable in this movie. Spoofed off H.G. Wells ""Time Machine"" ""BTTF"" is memorable all the way. Meeting your folks would be fun, but tampering with the past is not a game. Marty has to learn that hard. I liked the parts where he meets his father in the diner, and watch his future wife undress. Marty knew his father was a ""peeping tom"" when he was younger. Then trying to make a difference in their lives was the big part from keeping him and his siblings from non-existence was a bigger challenge. When everything was restored, Marty's finally changed for the better, though he introduced the skateboarding craze which one of the kids were amazed completely. Sticking to the dreams is important, listening to Dr. Brown is a must. Robert Zemeckis is a genius, and he really put up a solid cast and characters for the movie. The music rocks! I thought is was great, my mother digs Michael J. Fox! 5 stars!"
04.02.2006,10.0,"I can't start to tell you how awesome this movie is! Especially the effects for its time! I just love this movie for the story.But, i wonder why it is rated PG? it has an unreasonable amount of FOWL,FOWL language in it! Parents beware!: before you let your young one's see this, you had better watch it, first! Or, you can just let them watch the T.V. version if it! It also has ONE scene of teen drinking and smoking!I wonder how they got all of that time travel stuff in the De Lorean?I really recommend this movie! if you are an 80's fanatic, you will love this movie!"
27.01.2006,10.0,"Quite simply the most entertaining time-travel movie ever. The story is magnificent all the way, expertly written with some of the most memorable dialog ever to grace the silver screen. It's lighthearted approach is spot on, the film has a suspenseful finale and last but not least the cast is the best.Michael J. Fox is just perfect in the lead and Christopher Lloyd is even more perfect as the crazy scientist who invents time-travel. Crispin Glover is hilarious as Fox's Dad, Leah Thompson has never been lovelier and Thomas F. Wilson is a riot as the ultimate bully (Wilson proved to be Part II's sole saving grace).Terrific filmmaker Robert Zemeckis directs with a sure hand, the film is fast paced, has a great soundtrack (Johnny B. Goode has never sounded better), great special effects, in short; Back to the Future has everything that a great comedy is supposed to have, in spades.Must have seen like 20 times and I never tire of it. This is timeless entertainment and in light of recent comedies one can better appreciate the level of fun this movie provides. They simply don't make 'em like this anymore."
23.01.2006,10.0,"This is a movie I have seen a number of times. I'd watch it again. Anytime. It has something for everyone - romance, action, comedy, adventure, drama, suspense. It does not lag! Science fiction is not my first pick for a movie, unless it's REALLY GOOD SCIENCE FICTION, like the Star Trek movies or any of the THREE Back To The Future movies. In this movie, our hero (Michael J. Foxx) gets to see how some foolish decisions work against him and ruin his future. Luckily, he gets the chance to change those decisions. He also gets to see how following one's dreams can make for a beautiful future. Strongly recommend. See the trilogy!"
19.01.2006,10.0,"This movie came out just a year after I graduated high school, and by then I had seen many movies of many genres. Back to the Future was, in my opinion, not only well written, but also well acted. This is definitely a classic for anyone who is a collector.Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly has befriended an eccentric scientist whom he calls, ""Doc."" The scientist is one zany actor, Christopher Lloyd. The two are a wonderful pair. If any of you remember, Michael was in Family Ties, and Christopher was in Taxi. Brilliant actors, and a brilliant unfolding script.What makes this movie so wonderful is that it isn't exactly predictable. You will be on the edge of your seats if you tend to get wrapped up in a move. I know I thought I had it solved in the first fifteen minutes as I usually do, but no! There are many details that would tend to escape the untrained eye for the two sequels to follow.If you are going to watch this movie, then be prepared for the next two. They are the filler for this. And like I said, pay attention to everything."
11.01.2006,10.0,"The first time I saw this movie, I was like screaming with joy!! I had never seen a more enjoyable and witty movie in my life till then. About the time I was a teenager, thinking about what I would not do to go back in time and change things in the past!!! The 'time travel' trilogy is, I think the best that is, though not scientifically accurate. Robert Zemickis' shots of the DeLorean were amazing and well cut (though somebody reported seeing black gloves on some remote-controlled shots of the DeLorean! - frankly I could not make out the gloves. OK, maybe I am blind!). Michael J. Fox as the young ambitious Marty McFly and his 'Someday Jeniffer, Someday!' remain embedded in my mind. I think Fox plays the teenager to utmost perfection. I have never seen a teenager like that in my entire life!!! Doc Brown remains the most memorable scientists ever played in Hollywood! Christopher Loydd was impeccable, amazing!!! Kudos to Robert Zemickis for creating one of Hollywoods greatest characters in comedy! Amazing performances by Thomas Wilson (Biff Tannen) and Crispin Glover who plays the wimpy 'dad'. Doc's 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything!' has got to be one of Hollywood's most positive dialogs. This is one movie that will always be one my favorites."
10.01.2006,8.0,"This film has a pace & magnificence which transcends major holes in the plot/ script. Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd are at the top of their careers in this film. They have capable support although the sequels proved that even though Crispin Glover has a good sized supporting role in this film, he really does not add anything by his presence as he is not even missed in the sequels. He did sue producers for the using stock footage of him in the sequels & won the suit, but he'd have been better off to have appeared in the films because he is now much in danger of being referred to as Crispin who? I love the Huey Lewis songs in this first installment. It is nearly impossible to write a time travel film & get it right but you love the main characters & the music so much that you don't care but some obvious ones include Marty McFly paying for coffee in a 1950's Cafe with 1980's money. The license plate coming off the car when they transport Einstein is a great effect but also makes no sense. The changes in the photo of the McFly kids make no sense as why would only the oldest son be effected by problems in the space-time continuum? Humor is a main ingredient of this movie. From classics like how to open a Coke bottle in the 1950's to ""who the hell is John F Kenedy?"" to Pepsi Free, there is humor throughout the film. I like the Fox - Llloyd quotes:""You built a time machine out of a Deloran?"" ""The way I see it, if your going to travel through time you gotta do it with some style!""The people who carry this film are Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd who is really over the top. Put your brain away, & get on into the DMC time machine. Enjoy it!"
05.01.2006,10.0,"I own all three Back to the Future movies. I found that the first was classic, and quite easy to follow compared to the second. The second wasn't hard to follow, but it took a little thinking. I personally like the casting and plot of this movie. The idea for using a DeLorean as a time machine is brilliant. I like other films from the 80s, like Lethal Weapon, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Return of the Jedi, but by far, Back to the Future is superior. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy or adventure. Marty is probably my favourite character, followed by Doc. If you are to watch the first Back to the Future, I HIGHLY recommend watching the other two."
27.12.2005,10.0,"One of the best movies ever to graced earth in form of a TRILOGY.Most people wouldn't even stop to think about it. But this Movie Is full of Depth meanings, Richfull moments and serious things aside from the Wonderful Adventure, Special FX, Characters, acting skills it can certainly provide the viewer. We are looking at one simple damn good script from Bob gale and Zemeckis.We are getting one Fabulous Soundtrack From Master Alan Silvestri. And most of all we are lighted by the most wonderful characters, heartwarming and human there could be. Time travel Story About A kid who accidentally go back to the time their parents met. And attempting to go back to his own time, he discovers he can make things better...This is Back to the Future, An all time adventure, a classic, And a film that tries to show you that no matter how hard things in your life can turn out... There is always a chance to make it right; to change them... Because, Future is not written yet."
22.12.2005,9.0,"My favourite movie of all time, no matter how many times I watch it. Classic, funny, and interesting, full of action all the way through. And the sequels are good as well. A great movie for all ages, whether you are young or old, a fan of science fiction movies, old movies, or comedies. Something that never gets old. Not only is the plot great buy Christopher Loyd is amazing in this movie. Hilarious and eccentric, he is not easily forgotten. Marty is a classic teenager, with embarrassing parents and a love of rock and roll. Doc Brown is an eccentric scientist who has finally invented something that works, and along with the rest of the cast, they make a wonderful movie that captures our hearts and our minds."
21.12.2005,9.0,"I thought that this film an the follow up two were excellent. Michael j fox and Christopher Lloyd were a brilliant comedic team. And if the rumors are true I cant wait to see if Michael follows up with a 4th movie. go Michael. If every body watched closely in the second they would of all seen the beginning talents of little Elijah woods. Go Frodo.... So I recommend if every body loves little Michael J then definitely go an rent out this box set or better yet go buy it you wont be disappointed. I definitely wasn't. Thank you Robert Zemeckis for bringing us these truly wonderful films, I always wished that I could sit beside the doc an fly off in the DeLorean."
05.12.2005,9.0,"Back to the Future is a classic. What more do you have to know. It had just about everything you need in a great film. Marty Mcfly(Mike J. Fox) is sent back in time to 1955. What a great year, even though my parents weren't even born yet. Marty finds out that his mother ""has the hots"" for him. What a plot! So, Marty must ""hook"" his mother with his nerdy father, so everything in the future is A OK. Along the way in 1955, Marty gets in and out of trouble. Mostly with Biff, the high school bully. In the end, the film comes out great. A great cast, and music...if you like 1955 music. If you have not seen this film..you have to be living on a different planet. BTTF is a film you will mostly enjoy."
01.12.2005,10.0,"my favorite part of ""Back To The Future"" was when the professor yelled out 1.21 gigawatt's. that part cracks me up still today and i don't get tired of hearing that part nor tired of the movie. i loved it. This was a great movie because the ideas seemed almost plausible. This movie and the other ones showed you just how much of an impact any small change in the past could affect the outcome of the future. I thought the cast was a great fit for ""Back To The Future."" Michael J. Fox does a great job as Marty McFly. There were quite a few funny parts of the movie that i just couldn't stop laughing about. i can't think of a movie that i have watched as much and not get bored with except for ""The Karate Kid."""
20.11.2005,10.0,"After 20 years this movie is still one of the best. Once you get into this movie you don't want to get out. I like this movie so much that I have watched it more times than I can count!! Just the music in it alone you'll love. With the exception of the first 15 minutes you'll really enjoy this movie. I urge you to buy this movie, and the whole rest of the trilogy because it's something the whole family will love. It's heart pounding entertainment and it was done very well by a very good director! This movie may now be a part of the past but, the future lies in our hands!!!"
15.11.2005,9.0,"I remember watching this film in 1986 and was just totally dumbstruck this at the time was the best film I had ever seen and it seemed like an eternity for parts 2 + 3 to come. This movie had everything comedy, action, imagination and best of all a great plot which carried on throughout parts 2 + 3 I would recommend this movie to anybody and by just watching this you will see for yourself why you must see the sequels. This movie rates in my top ten movies of all times, whilst the trilogy of back to the future is second only to the Star Wars Adventures. If anyone wants my opinion this will go down as one of the greatest movies of all time of that I am sure don't delay its well worth a look and is great for the whole family to enjoy."
13.11.2005,9.0,"This is the film that started it all. Back to the Future is an original film in which time travel meets comedy. The film is told well with plenty of jokes. One of the best things about it is that it makes science fiction look 'cool' and introduces that genre to a wider audience who previously thought that science fiction was all about geeks dressed up looking like Star Trek characters. There is a good blend of comedy and action, and the general public was able to appreciate it for the comedy and popular culture -- and for the 1950s jokes and characters that we can identify with. If you haven't seen it, this is a film that should not be missed. I am glad to see that it is still popular."
10.11.2005,10.0,"This has got to be one of the coolest movies ever made and the pinnacle of 80's popcorn cinema! High school teenager Marty McFly is sent back to 1955 through a DeLorean time machine invented by his friend, nutty scientist Doc Emmett Brown. Once there, he inadvertently changes the course of time. He must now do everything he can in order to bring his parents back together or he and his siblings will be erased from existence. He must also fight off school bully Biff Tannen and ultimately get back to the future. Director and co-writer Robert Zemeckis gives us pure solid entertainment with excellent pacing, likable characters, and a cleverly-written screenplay. The special effects are also exceptional. Twenty years later, they still look fresh and new. Zemeckis also succeeds in bringing to life an idealized and nostalgic 1950's look. Furthermore, the movie is filled with great performances. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are superb and have great chemistry together. Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, and Thomas F. Wilson are also splendid in their underrated performances. Alan Silvetri's musical score and a couple of songs from Huey Lewis and the News are also enjoyable and serve their purpose to heighten the excitement. This is such a great movie for people of all ages. It personally holds a special place in my heart because of the fond memories it brings. I've seen it countless times since I was a kid and it never gets tiring. A must see for all!"
07.11.2005,10.0,"First, sorry for my spelling; I usually speak french! :P When Marty goes back in 1885 in back to the future part 3, he damaged the gasoline tank. They had to push the car with a train because they were out of gas. But there was another solution! There were 2 dolorean in 1885. The first one was the dolorean that Marty find in 1955 at the beginning of the movie and that he push with the train to go back in 1985 at the end of the movie. The second one was the dolorean that Doc have hided a few days ago near the cemetery (The car that Marty find at the beginning of the movie). Why they don't take the gas from this car?There would be no problem to make a continuation to this trilogy. Even if the car in destroyed, Doc and Marty could travel the time with the train (at the end of the part 3) and use the car as many time as they want! These 3 movies are so good that they leave us wanting more, and I'm sure that a continuation, even these days in 2005, would be as popular then the 3 first movies."
03.11.2005,10.0,"This film is just one of a kind. The charm and wit are so good it will have you wonder how they came up with such a concept, Michael J Fox is at his best as are the rest of the cast. Humour,comedy, science fiction, this film has it all. This film will remain timeless,I would urge anyone who loves films to add this one to their list now. The special effects are still great looking and look far better then most effects today, your heart will still be in your mouth when Marty races towards the clock tower in a bid to get struck by lightning, this is a film you will watch again and again and will always put a smile on your face."
23.10.2005,9.0,"I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of ""Doc"", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong."
26.09.2005,10.0,"I tended to like the movies as they appeared. I was at an age with the first one came out that I understood it well and will always believe it's even one of my favorite movies of all time. Had a wonderful crush on Marty, even Biff (but I won't admit it aloud), always though Lorraine was beautiful, but a little strange and thought her attraction to Marty was a typical plot twist, but oh so humorous. Part II was great too, not as good as the first, but the way it seemed so believable and the ideas they came up with, were superb. Part III, I've probably seen about ten times, it's watchable, but halfway likable.What are your opinions??? Francesca "" Radiation suit? Of course, because of all the fallout from the atomic wars!"" -- Doc 1955 (The Original)"
23.09.2005,7.0,"Okay, so maybe ""Back to the Future"" seems a little hokey, but it's so cool! You probably know the story: typical '80s teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back to 1955. His existence is threatened when his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) falls for him instead of his father George (Crispin Glover). Only the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) can help him. Along the way he has to cope with local bully Biff Tannen.If the movie is excessively nostalgic, then they play it to good effect. I sometimes have to wonder what would happen if I accidentally went back in time and met my parents. Given what happens in this movie, it's probably best that I stay in my own time.Anyway, it's an interesting contrast/comparison between the '50s and '80s. After all, who in the '50s would have imagined Reagan becoming president, or any town having an African-American mayor? So check this movie out; it won't disappoint you."
02.09.2005,,"At this address: http://imdb.com/title/tt0429631/ There's a BTTF Game made in 2004 listed here. At this point I'm assuming it's some error on the IMDBs part, because a search of the internet reveals nothing about this game, as does a search of Gamefaqs.Anyone able to shed some light on this? It's possible that it's just a webgame, but usually they don't list those on this site from what I can see. It would certainly be great if this game were substantial and good, but then, if it were I think more people would know about it, or at least some people would anyway. But really, is there a way to make a good Back to the Future game that remains true to the story and characters without being boring? Only time will tell...-Jon"
11.08.2005,8.0,"Back to the Future is a movie I can guarantee you will enjoy. It starts off when Marty McFly gets into a lot of trouble. Including with his girlfriend and school (are you surprised?!). But then Marty realizes, his best friend, a scientist who he calls 'doc', just invented a time machine... and guess what? It actually works! But then something happens. When he is about to go to the year 1955, doc is shot by Libyain terrorists from whom he stole plutonium, the liquid that makes the time machine work. Without any choices, Marty scrambles into the car and... finds himself in the year 1955. But the story doesn't end there. Marty accidentally stops his parents (who were teenagers then) from meeting and falling in love with each other, and puts his life at risk. Because if his parents never met, that means that they never had any children. And if Marty doesn't get to get his parents to meet each other.. it means that him and his brothers will simply disappear off the face of the earth. Also, Marty and the young doc encounter another problem. Marty needs to get back to the future, and he can't as plutonium was barely known in the 1950s. So how will he do it? See and find out! This movie is simply cool. Not only is it funny, it also has an excellent script and dialog. I like the cast and the characters and I also liked the set decoration. Nearly everything about this movie is good. However, you have to pay full attention at the start to understand what happens later. But that doesn't spoil it. Rating: 7.5/10"
10.08.2005,,"Back To The Future is a great movie that has everything.A terrific story, memorable characters, great acting, dead-on satire, beautiful FX and great music. Every scene in this movie is a winner. Probably this movie works because it never takes itself seriously. From start to finish the movie contains an amazing wealth of visual gags (the giant guitar speaker, the DeLorean time machine), classic lines (""You can't have a Pepsi Free. You gotta pay for it."") and in-jokes (rocker Huey Lewis complaining that the music is too loud). The time travel logic, so hard to pull off, is done with great flair, suitable for any science fiction movie. Except this isn't a sci-fi film. It's a comedy with a heavy dose of social satire mixed in and it works on both levels. Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly a teenager who would rather play guitar than do anything else. He's friendly with the town's off-the-wall inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd.) Doc creates a time machine and Marty is accidentally transported back to the year 1955. There he meets a younger version of his parents (Crispin Glover and Leah Thompson) and has to arrange for them to meet so they will get married and have him.The role of Marty McFly was ideal for Michael J. Fox. His ability to play a teenager transferred perfectly from TV (Family Ties) to the big screen. Crispin Glover is terrific as Marty's father, George McFly. He has a dual role, as a teenager and an adult. Christopher Lloyd is almost over-the-top as the nutty inventor. Thomas Wilson is Biff, the bully who constantly torments George McFly. Other than Forrest Gump this is Robert Zemeckis's best movie. Kids and adults will appreciate it."
08.08.2005,10.0,"This film is probably one of the best films of all time and a modern classic. I don't really like sci-fi films but this appeals to people on so many levels and genres that things like that don't really matter. Christopher Lloyd plays Doc Brown to absolute perfection when he swans around as if conducting an orchestra. Michael J Fox is the star of the movie but the supporting roles are cast so well that all of the characters are stars in their own right. I particularly like Thomas F Wilson as Biff and the way that he gets more manic and vicious as the trilogy unfolds. The combination of excellent special effects, brilliant directing and the true skill of the actors means that this is one of the few mainstream cult classics. It's a film for the whole family without being patronising or babyish. Ace!"
02.08.2005,8.0,"Even though I'm still convinced that the eighties are one of the worst decades in recent history when it comes to movies and music and even though I never liked Sci-Fi movies, there is one big exception to that rule. In my opinion ""Back to the Future"" is not only one of the best movies in the genre, it's also in my list of all time favorite movies. When I saw it for the first time, I remember to be blown away by it. But than again, I was only 10 years old, not exactly an age on which you've already seen many really good movies to which you can compare another one. But even now, 20 years after its first release and after I've seen hundreds of movies, I still like it a lot.It's 1985 and Marty McFly is a typical teenager who doesn't like his parents and who has some problems at school. His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of all kinds of (useless) machines. But this time he has invented something that is much more interesting. He has created a plutonium-powered time machine based on a DeLorean. But when something goes wrong, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955, the time in which his parents still were young. Not only has he got to adapt to this entirely new environment, he also has to make sure that nothing is changed, because that might have serious consequences for the future...I guess the best reason why this movie works so well and feels so timeless is because they don't use the time machine to go forward. Instead of showing us the future, which wouldn't look exactly like it is right now, they have chosen to go back 30 years, a time period which they new very well and could recreate perfectly. If they hadn't done this, the movie would have felt dated one day and no-one would have liked it because it was far from possible. Another good thing about this movie is the acting. Take for instance Michael J. Fox. Not everything that he has done in his career was very successful, but in this movie he shines. I truly believe that this is one of his best performances ever. The same for Christopher Lloyd. Even though his Dr. Emmett Brown looks like if he could have come out of a cartoon, his acting gives the character something likable and makes you forget about that 'problem'.Overall I really liked this movie a lot. It's one of the finest examples in Sci-Fi movies and I can keep watching it time after time. That's why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than 8/10."
29.07.2005,9.0,"HUGE 1980s hit movie. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox in his breakthrough role) has a miserable life. His father is a wimp, his mother an alcoholic and they live in a rundown area. His only friend is a crazy scientist (Christopher Lloyd). Lloyd turns a DeLorean into a time machine (don't ask) and Fox accidentally ends up in 1955. He also accidentally fumbles his parents first meeting--so his mom is falling for him! He has to get his parents together...or he won't exist. And how is he going to get back to 1985?Sounds silly but this actually is a lot of fun. The direction is good and the script is fast and very funny--I LOVED Lloyd's reaction to Reagan being president and Fox dealing with 1950s life. Also the 1950s outfits and cars are incredible. SPOILER!!! It does go a little too far at the end with Fox supposedly inspiring Chuck Berry--but that's a small complaint. END SPOILER!!! The acting is good. Fox and Lloyd are both great and play off each other very well--some of Fox's dead pan expressions to Lloyds ravings are quite funny. And Fox is so YOUNG! Lea Thompson was excellent playing Fox's mother--she convincingly ages herself AND looks like a teenager. Crispin Glover overdoes it though as Fox's father--TOO over the top. Also great to see Frances Lee McCain playing Thompson's mother--this woman is a great actress and played mothers through many great 1980s film (like ""Footloose"", ""Gremlins"", ""Stand By Me"" and into the 90s with ""Scream""). Also Billy Zane (in his first role) appears as a bully--but has no dialogue.Only two things spoil this a little. The open ending (it ends with ""to be continued..."") and the constant product placement--I know a lot of movies do it but here it was virtually nonstop! When it starts calling attention to itself that's a problem.Also Huey Lewis and the News (remember them?) had a big hit with the opening song ""The Power of Love"". And don't miss Lewis' cute cameo as a teacher at the beginning. I give this a solid 9."
29.07.2005,9.0,"The creative and entertaining science fiction content in this film certainly is a draw. Aside from that, this film satisfies an urge most of us have to know and experience what our parents were like when they were young and falling in love, and to understand what it was life to live in those times. The film's depiction of the contrasts between the world of the 1950s and the 1980s gives viewers food for thought about how our culture evolved, and what we've gained and lost in the process. Performances are universally credible, sometimes brilliant, and advance the plot nicely. Another point in this film's favor is amid all the attractive technoflash, the director wasn't afraid to limn characters who have real feelings."
26.07.2005,10.0,"This is a great movie. I like it so much. No, I don't like it, I LOVE it. It is one of my all-time favorite movies that I could seriously watch one hundred times in a row and not get bored of it.Christopher Lloyd plays Doc Brown, a scientist who invents the flux capacitor which is ""what makes time travel possible"". When him and his friend, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), decide to test it out on his dog, Einstein, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955! With trying to get his parents to fall in love and get back to his normal life to be reunited with his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, life becomes complicated.This movie is funny, intelligent, and is just a feel-good movie. Sit down with some popcorn and enjoy!"
21.07.2005,10.0,"wow. how do i put my opinions of this film into words. it is my favourite movie purely cos its fun, entertaining, understandable but with a bit of a mind tester the first time u see the trilogy but it has the certain spark many other movies don't. michael j fox became my fav actor after this movie. even tho i was only 8 when i first saw it. its the only movie that i can watch over and over again without getting bored. this is a timeless classic with comedy, science fiction, action, special effects and adventure all packed into one. this is an almost perfect movie even tho i cant see what could be improved. but nothing is perfect is it. this is very close. I'm pretty sure everyone has seen it but if not. get out there and watch this. it will blow u away. it is absolutely outstanding cinema"
10.07.2005,10.0,"We've all looked in our parents picture albums of their childhood. In back to the future you can see what actually happened.Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has made a time machine out of a DeLorean. Modern day (1985) teenager Marty McFly (Micheal J Fox) accidentally travels back in time to the year 1955, interrupts his parents first meeting and has to get them together without affecting the time-line.Back to the Future (1985) is a sci-fi, drama, comedy but above all, feel good movie that draws from almost every film genre, as a result there's something there to enjoy for everyone. Watching multiple times is preferred to pick up the subtle details (watch the name of the mall).This movie along with it's two sequels is one of the few films that you can watch over and over again and it never gets boring. The sheer joy, the adventure, the humor and the basic themes and questions it deals with, make this to be one of the best films ever created.Also a great film for kids to have fun and learn something about how live was in the 80's and 50's at the same time.I can't wait for a future re-release that is re-edited so that the entire trilogy can be watched as one six hour long film without interruptions.10/10"
01.07.2005,8.0,"Back to the Future is an above average movie, and I especially enjoyed the first 30 minutes, when my eyes were totally glued to the screen. I think the movie successfully spans the genres of Sci-fi, Comedy and Adventure to come up with an original feel that appeals particularly to teenagers and young adults...After watching Back to the Future Part II for 30 minutes I could already see that it didn't match its predecessor. Repetition was rife and one of the characters (Jennifer) was put to sleep early on, which was surely a sign of a plot lacking direction. Don't think I'll bother watching Part III...I read a review a while ago suggesting that the Back to the Future trilogy was better than the Star Wars trilogy. I have to say, on the basis of what I've seen, I don't agree. Star Wars was an altogether more mature movie experience about life, the universe, and everything. Back to the Future is just good fun."
03.06.2005,10.0,"I love Back to the Future! Not only does it beat Star Wars, it also beats many more movies of its kind. Its so suspenseful, and yet, so touching and sweet. Its also hilarious to think that if you went back in time ur mother would fall in love with you! It presents a possible way of time travel. I love the Delorean, I want to get one. I love the scene at the clocktower in which Marty goes back to 1985. And I love the scene at the end where marty and the doc go back to the future, and doc says one his famous lines, ""where we're going we don't need roads!"" If you want something that the entire family would enjoy, get Back to the Future. I will say that you will need a curse-free DVD or vcr, for the movie has foul language in it, but other than that, ur good to go!"
25.05.2005,10.0,"I grew up loving this movie. I have surely been watching this movie some hundred times. The first time I was watching this movie was surely when I was about six years old. I knew Michael J. Fox - I just didn't know his name. I recognized him overall - in Spin City, The Frighteners etc. I had no good understanding of this movie when I was six years old, but hey, I was fascinated. Some five years later, I watched this again. With full understanding of this movie, I was not only fascinated - I completely loved it. Buying the DVD back in 2002, I watched this movie very regular in a period, pausing a while, trying to memorize everything. And it only raised my fascination and love for Back to the future.The plot? Marty McFly (J Fox) is an ordinary teenager in 1985 who usually meets his friend, the crazed doctor Brown (played by genial actor Christopher Lloyd), for some scientific researchs. But one night, he will find out what Dr Brown really is preparing - a time machine into a car. Surprised, but anyway fascinated, McFly loves the idea. But of an accident, McFly is going back to 30 years earlier his present date. And it is then he has to reunite his parents before everything goes weird - and if he doesn't replace everything as it was before, he risks to be unborn. Sounds crazy? Right. It does. But it is the point. Mixed with smart humor, well-done dialogs and fine ending, it is probably one of the best genre movies I've been watching. It's not only a science fiction movie. It is also a coming-of-age movie, mixed with action, comedy and drama. And all simply, Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd, in particular his crazy Einstein-hair, make this movie great. Highly recommended for you who want a mix of everything a Friday night."
