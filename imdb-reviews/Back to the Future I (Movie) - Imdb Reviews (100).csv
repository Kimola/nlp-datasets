03.08.2025,10.0,"This is the best movie ever, everyone rate it 10, great casting it should be #1, great story, great direction by Robert Zemeckis and incredible entertainment. All time adventure. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the best movie duo ever.Soundtrack is beautiful and iconic. Editing and production wow.From Einstein to The Hill Valley courthouse, from Johnny B. Goode to 88 mph scenes... I can go on and on, so many incredible details and entertaining ""heart-pounding"" scenes in this movie.The Shawshank redemption is nothing compared to this movie. Maybe it's not nothing but definitely is not better than BTTF.This one with BTTF part 2 and part 3 = The Best Trilogy of all Time."
03.05.2025,5.0,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Marty McFly is a very likable, well-acted character. The film starts out pretty well, introducing Marty's family and other characters, although it does take some time before the time travelling (from 1985 to 1955) occurs - The scenes with the Libyan terrorists at the parking lot seem to drag on and on. Also, what are Libyan terrorists doing in Los Angeles in the 1980s? Anyways...I would've liked to know how Doc met Marty. I mean, how would a 'cool' kid like Marty be friends with a 50+ year old geeky old guy? This isn't really a flaw, but just an honest contemplation. Speaking of the two, the ending dragged for too long. I won't spoil it. But the scene with Marty and Doc waiting for the lightning to strike at the clock became nauseating. I'm guessing the creators were just trying to show off the special effects and sound effects, which seemed pretty good for that time. But I didn't like it and that sequence killed the film's pace. Also, the movie ended in a way that leads to the sequel. So for those expecting a standalone film, you will not be satisfied.The music score by Alan Silvestri is classic and memorable. The characters are also very likable, hence why the film has a classic status. But I still feel it was let-down by the drawn out, bloating ending sequence near the clock tower."
23.02.2025,8.0,"Back to the Future is a near-perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy, and adventure that remains just as entertaining today as it was in 1985. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and featuring a fantastic cast, this film captures the essence of fun, excitement, and nostalgia in one unforgettable time-travel story.Michael J. Fox shines as Marty McFly, a relatable and charismatic teenager who finds himself accidentally sent back to 1955 in a DeLorean-turned-time-machine. His chemistry with Christopher Lloyd's eccentric Doc Brown is nothing short of iconic, making for some of the most memorable moments in film history. The story is fast-paced, filled with humor, and has just the right amount of emotional weight, especially when Marty tries to fix his parents' relationship.Alan Silvestri's triumphant score and the '80s rock soundtrack give the movie its energetic feel, while the practical effects and clever script make the time-travel mechanics easy to follow. If there's any flaw, it's that some of the science is more fantasy than logic, but honestly, that's part of the fun.Overall, Back to the Future is an endlessly rewatchable classic that still holds up today. It's got adventure, comedy, and heart-all wrapped up in a thrilling time-travel journey."
18.02.2025,10.0,"Back to the Future is a film that has firmly secured its place in my heart, and it's one I can watch on repeat without ever growing tired of it. From the very first time I saw it as a kid, I was instantly hooked. I know the entire movie by heart-the dialogue, the iconic scenes, and every memorable moment have been etched in my memory.The genius of Robert Zemeckis shines through as we follow the time-traveling adventures of Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox. As a child, I couldn't help but develop the biggest crush on Marty. His charm, wit, and rebellious spirit made him the quintessential hero for young audiences like me. Who could resist that iconic skateboard ride or the perfect blend of bravado and heart?This film is a true classic that masterfully combines science fiction, adventure, and comedy, all wrapped up in an engaging and entertaining story. The concept of time travel, with its potential for mishaps and adventures, captivated my imagination and sparked countless daydreams about what I would change in my own timeline.Back to the Future isn't just a film I watched; it's an experience that has stayed with me throughout my life. Its themes of friendship, perseverance, and the casual certainty that life can lead to unexpected twists are messages that resonate deeply. It's a film I hold dear to my heart, and sitting down to watch it always feels like visiting an old friend."
15.02.2025,10.0,"Back to the Future is the greatest film in every way. The characters are perfect and funny. The story is amazing and some-what grounded. The music is absolutely magnificent. Doc and Marty are the perfect duo (being solar opposites) and references and little Easter eggs you can catch on your future viewings are absolutely mind blowing and comes to show what a great screenplay Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale made. If your looking for a funny, sci-fi, romance, action, 80s classic look no further than Back to the Future. One of if not Steven Spielberg's best film ever made besides Jaws.""Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads."" - Dr. Emmett Brown."
08.02.2025,10.0,"Ultimate American summer blockbuster. Incredibly clever, nostalgia-packed, and never gets old. Just when it would seem that Steven Spielberg has touched all possible forms of fantasy, he comes up with another one that not only plucks, but plays a complete symphony, on the heartstrings. It's all fiendishly complicated but Zemeckis is an inventive filmmaker with a knack for the happy ending. Disney would have been proud of him -- and more than a little envious of an entertainment which takes a risk or two, and has a ball doing it. I loved it was timeless and I could gladly watch it over and over and over again."

07.01.2025,10.0,"This is a fun, irresistible and original film. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sophisticated. The cinematography, scenery and costumes are excellent. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in his role and so is Michael J Fox, he is also brilliant in his role as Marty Mc Fly. This is overally a brilliant film that is good in so many ways. Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect. The story is awesome. It is delivered cleverly and entertainingly. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something to watch."
05.01.2025,10.0,"I've never written a movie review, despite having watched so many that I've lost count. I was born in 1981, so when this movie came out, I was just a child. Over 40 years have passed, and I can confidently say that this is the movie I've watched the most times in my entire life. Every time I'm channel surfing and this movie is on, I simply can't resist watching it again. The remote stops right there. I think that says it all. For me, this is the best movie ever made.It doesn't fit into any specific genre, in my opinion. It's simply Back to the Future. For those who lived through the '80s and '90s, they'll surely understand its charm. For those who didn't, I don't have the insight to make any judgment, but I believe it's timeless."
30.12.2024,4.0,"In the mainstream Hollywood movies of the 1980s, America was a nation in the process of reconciliation. This reconciliation aims to repair the wounds inflicted on America by the movements of the 1960s and the divisions of the 1970s.So Hollywood in the 1980s tells the story of reconciliation between two generations. In the 1982 film ""The Golden Pond,"" not only did Henry Fonda's grandfather and grandson reach mutual understanding, but he also reached mutual forgiveness with his daughter, Jane Fonda, both in the film and in reality. In 1983, the once popular Star Wars series also reached its final chapter, in which the evil father Black Knight was finally influenced by his son Luke, who sacrificed himself to save him."
29.12.2024,10.0,This movie is a great start of a movie franchise and the writing is awesome. The characters are so greatly written in a way that makes total sense and the learning process is great. The time process doesn't really have any plot holes. The dad glow up is insane and the songs that are in it are amazing the post credit scene is a great way to leave a cliffhanger. It amazing that falling out of a tree and getting hit by a car lead his mother falling in love with him and him having to have his dad fight his high school bully for her to fall in love with him was a great come back for his wimpy character.

09.12.2024,10.0,"What else can really be said about Back to the Future? This beloved movie has been praised in so many ways over the years, that i cant even think of a original thing to say about it. It's a classic, a masterpiece of modern american cinema, one of the most rewatchable movies of all time. Michael J Fox is incredible, Christopher Lloyd is incredible, Lea Thompson is incredible, Crispin Glover is incredible, EVERYONE is incredible in this goddamn film! The direction, the script, etc... Everything is so tight and well put togheter, it's amazing! One of those rare ""lightning in the bottle"" moments in cinema history, when everything that was suppose to go right, GOES RIGHT!"
08.12.2024,10.0,"This was the movie that made me love science fiction movies. I was around 7 years old when I first watched it and I really enjoyed it. Years have passed since I first watched it, but I still watch the movie with the same admiration, it was really great. I thought the movie was pretty good for an 80's movie. The movie's story is also a very original and carefully written story. There are also many references to this movie (The first movie of the movie serie) in the other movies of the movie serie.It was truly one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, and also the best time travel movie I've ever seen. This movie is really worth watching I definitely recommend it to everyone."
01.12.2024,10.0,"The epitome of excellence in Hollywood, ""Back to the Future"" is timeless, inspiring, and memeable. The pace here is seamless, every moment has plot significance, and every word uttered is valuable and meaningful. This careful crafting of visual presentation, audible experience and narrative concept existed at a time of relative peace and stability in the American economy. Little did we know everything would go downhill from here: an era of complete uncertainty leading to massive corporate greed, a sharp drop in production quality, and an industry absorbed by politics instead of artform. The laisse faire attitude of 80s Hollywood management allowed for more directorial creativity and oversight, compared to the complicated and overzealous requirements demanded by today's itchy fingered producers and executives.""Back to the Future"" deals with very common human issues such as self-esteem, effort and maturity, all while presenting an intriguing premise, pressing matters, romance, friendship and conflict all rolled into one. If the definition of Art is ""the mirror we hold up to ourselves"" (Shakespeare, Hamlet), then the imitation of nature that this science fiction dramedy presents is among the best in the craft of filmmaking: It's not about the science or the fiction; it's about people.Today's world poses many threats to studio success: legal action can be taken if your production presents defamatory or misleading information; social backlash can arise from a lack of respect to the genre or franchise; studio acceptance can be jeopardized from simple misrepresentation of race or gender... what we have now is a literal minefield of judicial hurdles, social media timebombs and the precarious balancing of identity politics over qualification and competence in hiring. Its no wonder, then, that activists, poles, statistics and even artificial intelligence have taken center stage in the development of studio projects: every obstacle to success must be accounted for. The excessive hand holding has led to a soulless industry, one so obsessed with minutia, that its now incapable of seeing the forest from the trees. Art has completely left the building, replaced by obligation to pretense and the third quarter. Hopefully, future generations will rely on past productions, such as this one, for inspiration, guidance, and understanding of the human experience."
29.11.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is a near-perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, and adventure, earning high praise for its clever storytelling, memorable characters, and infectious energy. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg, this iconic film has stood the test of time, captivating audiences with its creativity and timeless appeal.The story follows teenager Marty McFly, played with charm and charisma by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a time machine invented by the eccentric Dr Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd. Marty's quest to return to 1985 becomes a race against time as he inadvertently disrupts his parents' first meeting, threatening his very existence.Fox delivers an effortlessly engaging performance, bringing humour and relatability to Marty as he navigates the past with a mix of resourcefulness and teenage awkwardness. Lloyd is equally outstanding as Doc, with his larger-than-life energy and wild-eyed enthusiasm creating one of cinema's most beloved characters. The dynamic between Marty and Doc is the heart of the film, with their unlikely friendship driving much of the story's charm.The script, co-written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, is a masterpiece of structure and wit, deftly weaving together humour, tension, and heartfelt moments. The way the film balances the high stakes of time travel with light-hearted comedy is nothing short of genius. From the hilariously awkward scenes with Marty's teenage mother to the nail-biting clock tower sequence, every moment feels perfectly calibrated.Alan Silvestri's iconic score amplifies the film's sense of adventure and wonder, while the 1980s rock hits, particularly Huey Lewis and the News' The Power of Love, give the film its unforgettable vibe. The production design is equally impressive, capturing both the 1980s and 1950s with meticulous attention to detail, making the time-jump feel immersive and authentic.The only minor drawback is that certain elements of the plot, particularly the more dated social dynamics, may not resonate as strongly with modern audiences. However, these moments do little to detract from the film's overall impact.In conclusion, Back to the Future is an endlessly entertaining and cleverly crafted film that continues to delight viewers of all ages. With its sharp humour, heartwarming story, and unforgettable performances, it has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films of all time. A near-flawless adventure that is as timeless as its title suggests."
21.11.2024,10.0,"Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack."
12.11.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is a film that holds a special place in my heart, and watching it again recently reminded me why it's such a timeless classic. From the moment the iconic DeLorean roars to life, I was transported back to a world where time travel is not just a fantasy, but a thrilling adventure. The film's blend of humor, science fiction, and heartwarming moments creates an experience that resonates with audiences of all ages.Michael J. Fox's portrayal of Marty McFly is nothing short of iconic. His youthful exuberance and relatable struggles make him an endearing protagonist. And then there's Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown, whose eccentricity and wisdom provide the perfect counterbalance to Marty's character. Their chemistry is electric, and every scene they share is filled with laughter and genuine emotion.The screenplay is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving together themes of friendship, family, and the consequences of our choices. I found myself laughing at the clever nods to the 1950s culture while also appreciating the film's deeper messages. The way it tackles the idea of altering one's own past and the ripple effects that can have is both thought-provoking and entertaining.The soundtrack, particularly the unforgettable theme by Alan Silvestri, adds an extra layer of magic to the film. It's one of those scores that sticks with you long after the credits roll, evoking a sense of nostalgia and adventure.Watching Back to the Future in a packed theater, surrounded by fellow fans, was an experience I'll cherish. The collective gasps, laughter, and cheers made me realize how this film transcends generations. It's a movie that sparks joy, ignites conversations, and leaves you with a smile on your face.In a world where films often come and go, Back to the Future remains a shining beacon of creativity and fun. It's a film I can revisit time and time again, discovering new nuances with each viewing. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience this cinematic gem. It's not just a movie; it's a journey through time that you won't want to miss."
09.11.2024,8.0,"Balancing Sci Fi with Comedy and Drama is one of the hardest combinations in the entertainment industry, and 'Back to the Future' nails it almost perfectly. The blend of wit, charm and consideration creates a tasty and wholesome family movie with a sense of consequence for the character's actions.Michael J. Fox is sensational, giving that comical edge to take the pressure off you while also feeling human and grounded. Christopher Lloyd is marvellous. Crispin Glover is beautiful as this pathetic man at the centre at it all. Tom Wilson makes his first appearance although out of the three he has the least impact.The sense of place and atmosphere is striking, largely due to great well lit cinematography and steady handed screenplay. It's textbook brilliance for the period and deserving as a cultural icon."
03.11.2024,9.0,"Probably one of the best, if not the best, trilogies ever made and also one of my personal favourites. Always had a soft spot for this film since I was a little kid.Watching the film I could not but think about the brilliance of the script and the direction. I always trust Tarantino on this, as he says, the perfect movie.I don't know what makes this film great: the concept, the performances, the chemistry between Marty and Doc, the music, the 80's setting, the sci-fi elements, the romantic comedy elements-or maybe it's all of that? How can all of those elements coexist in one single film without destroying it?I guess that that's what would happen today, and it is not what happened in 1985, certainly not when you have Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis around."
18.10.2024,9.0,"Great time travel DMC DeLorean , memorable characters and very likable dialogues. And one that will stick in your head for a long time is Doc! It's a fun and feel-good movie. I've watched it since I was a kid and I've watched it over 10 times now and I'm still not bored of it. It's a really good memory. Although the rest of the series are fun, the first series is still the best. But there might be a downside, maybe only in the Dub zone of my country, some words are not translated correctly, so I had to find the English version to watch. When watching both languages, it's fun in different ways."
17.10.2024,10.0,"I just got done watching Back to the Future (1985) for the first time ever and I absolutely loved every single minute of this movie.Positives for Back to the Future (1985):
The movie's premise is absolutely brilliant to where you have this boy going back in time and see what the world was like when his parents were teenagers. This is a premise that has been done multiple times since this movie first came out and while some of them have come close, none have been able to capture the magic of this original movie. The other thing that makes this movie work is the cast of characters and the actors portraying them. First off you have Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly who is easily one of the best movie characters in the history of cinema and he's one of those characters who you easily relate to because of his natural on-screen presence and charisma. Then you have Christopher Lloyd as Emmett ""Doc"" Brown and this guy is one of the most entertaining and ecentric characters that you can't help but love him. I also enjoyed Crispin Glover as George McFly and Lea Thompson as Lorraine Baines McFly and their interactions with Marty are so fun to watch. Then you have Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen is one of the most easy to hate villains in cinematic history and he's not even one of these evil cartoonish villains that we see a lot in movies, he's just a big mean bully in high school and we all hate those people. The movie's score by Alan Silvestri is easily among one of the movie scores I've heard in any movie. The special effects for the time-travel sequences are phenomenal and they still hold up to this day. And finally, I just how good-natured this movie is with its approach and it's one of those comfort movies that you can watch at anytime in your life.Overall, Back to the Future (1985) is one of the greatest movies of all time.amd if you haven't watched this movie yet and then you need to watch it as soon as possible."
10.09.2024,7.0,This movie is a lot of fun the whole way through I love doc and Marty is a fun protagonist. The idea of what's going on and time travel has probably happened a lot but it stems from this and you can see why I think the ending is super sweet and how it just has full confidence and is like oh we have an idea for a sequel too is great cause it shows they had fun doing this and will do more which is great cause nowadays sequels feel forced and undeserved but this is just a whole lot of fun and def deserving of a sequal i remember watching 2 & 3 when I was younger and I'm excited to revisit them this month before they leave Netflix.
08.09.2024,8.0,"Back to the Future is a movie ahead of its time, utilizing an array of incredible effects that were unseen for its era. The narrative is super simple yet captivating, with a well-constructed story that avoids leaving any plot holes. The performances are amazing, and it has become an iconic film in pop culture.Elements like the Delorean and the concept of a time machine through a car are very original and practical, featuring a highly empathetic and human protagonist, with flaws and merits. The only downside to the film is certain sexist aspects of the time, based on the culture in which it was released."
07.09.2024,10.0,"Classic one of my favorite childhood movie, Literally, one of the best serious picture of all time. I have been watching this movie so many times, including the movie. The other the fantasy is going back literally one of the greatest idea. The acting is phenomenal and the effect horse back at the time revolutionary. I wish the day really did another movie in the series, this movie is enjoyable and it's not too long. It's perfect in terms of timing. I don't understand why all the new movies it's over three hours and you can really make movie in 90 minutes., Recommended to all the young generation that did not grew up on this movie."
06.09.2024,9.0,"Great 80's film. Hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually.9/10."
05.09.2024,10.0,"Back to the Future is one of those very nostalgic films.I remember exactly the day I received a box set with the three films from a friend of my mother. As it was late at night, I couldn't run the marathon. The next day I watched them all and immediately fell in love.All the settings, characters and stories leave everything characteristic and original, mainly due to the time in which it was made.Michael J. Fox Christopher Lloyd form a duo with perfect chemistry. No wonder they are called for interviews and lectures about the three films to this day.If there's one tip I can give to parents of children old enough to understand the story, it's: don't waste any more time, have a movie session at home to watch these three classics of world cinema with your children."
05.09.2024,10.0,"This is how a movie should be done. It's perfection from start to finish. I remember the first time that I saw it and I remember my house, the tv, the food that I was eating the happiness the nostalgia. If anyone doesn't like Back to the future he/she must be empty inside. There's no way to not love this perfection.The cinematography the story the comedy the actors everything is perfect and there's even 1 second of the movie that is boring. Everything is fast paced.

25.08.2024,9.0,"I love this film and can rewatch it every day if I can. The critiques of this film usually have a complaint about the ""scifi"" aspect of it, whether it justifies the science behind time travel or not. I would say that Back to the Future is like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. It falls more on the adventure-comedy genre than science-fiction. Everything that's happening here taken place in a fifth dimension that is beyond science and superstition.You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination."
23.08.2024,10.0,"I recently watched Back to the Future (1985) on Netflix. The storyline follows Marty McFly, a high school student dealing with the fallout of his father being bullied by his boss, which affects the entire family dynamic. His best friend, a quirky scientist, has been working on a time travel experiment. When Marty is called to help test the invention, the experiment works-but with tragic consequences, as the scientist is killed, and Marty is accidentally sent back in time. Now, Marty must find a way to change the course of history to help his family while also figuring out how to return home.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), the film stars Michael J. Fox (Teen Wolf), Christopher Lloyd (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), Lea Thompson (Howard the Duck), Crispin Glover (Willard), and Tom Wilson (Action Jackson).Back to the Future is 80s nostalgic gold in every way-storyline, characters, soundtrack, comedic elements, and its optimistic take on the core premise. The entire film is beautifully written, with Marty McFly being an easy character to root for. Michael J. Fox perfectly captures Marty's carefree and fun-loving nature. Crispin Glover delivers an underrated performance as Marty's quirky dad, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as the eccentric scientist. The depiction of the 1950s is pure fun, and the idea of a son inadvertently impacting his parents' relationship is both clever and engaging. The weaving together of time travel and family plots comes together seamlessly, culminating in a heartwarming full-circle ending. The Huey Lewis and the News soundtrack is iconic, and it's impossible not to love this film.In conclusion, Back to the Future is wholesome American cinematic gold and an absolute must-see. I would score it a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
16.08.2024,5.0,"This story is essentially a small, weak, dumb kid sort of accidentally travels back in time, makes irrationally bad decisions and then somehow triumphs in the end.When I saw this movie as a kid I thought it was pretty silly but fun, and if I was writing IMDB reviews in the 90s I probably would have rated it a 7/10. For anyone with a mind remotely based in science or logic nearly everything comes off too stupid or illogical to enjoy this movie. Marty McFly makes a terrible decision in nearly every situation and seems to keep forgetting that he traveled back In time. I can see how the bottom half of the population would identify with this idiotic protagonist and how some fan boys would love these movies despite their flaws, but I don't understand how anyone not in those categories could rate any of these movies above a 6.Some specifics that I don't think qualify as spoilers:
-Marty's family photo (from the ""future"") starts to fade based on his actions. This makes ZERO sense; if you altered your future and negated your existence, you wouldn't exist and the photo wouldn't exist. If they wanted to try and make scientific sense it would have been more like Schrödinger's Cat where Marty disappears intermittently and the photo changes.-After traveling back in time Marty seems to never remember he came from the future and makes every silly blunder possible to create issues for himself. He makes no attempt to blend in when it matters most, and in every situation he seems just as confused and flabbergasted that he's in the last, even though it's very clear he knows he is. It's sort of like he's willfully ignorant and is pretending to not remember he went back in time at only the worst times (aka bad writing)."
05.08.2024,10.0,"This is the greatest movie I have ever seen, my favorite of all time. I just love this movie so much. It has everything a great movie needs. A great cast, a great script, great characters, great plot, great scenes, great everything. From the beginning to the end, it is amazing. I just get a great, indescribable feeling when I watch it. Every time I can, I view it. There is quite literally nothing wrong with it. As Michael J. Fox said, ""It's ironic that a movie about time travel is timeless."" I totally agree. I hope, some day, I can show my children this movie, and they will love it as well. And as Forrest Gump said (which is kinda ironic because Robert Zemeckis directed both Forrest Gump and Back To The Future,) ""That's all I have to say about that."""
22.07.2024,10.0,"*Back to the Future* is more than just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that captures the essence of imagination and adventure in a way that transcends generations.

05.07.2024,10.0,"I haven't watched this in years, but our family is watching movies this holiday and Back to the Future series is up.And it holds up. Or, rather, it holds up enough, because obviously someone editing the same movie in 2024 might make a few other choices.On the other hand, I see plenty that is superior to the fare we regularly get now.Of course, Michael J Fox is a favorite, but how fun to see the entire cast in ensemble and remember how talented each casting choice was.The music is just exceptional in this series, substantial but fun, lifting and carrying the chase sequences especially.It's funny to see product placement in a movie I think of as a box office hit and even legendary. However, the placements themselves almost add to the fun as we look at the 1980's looking at the 1950's from the vantages of the 2020's. (What a trip.)"
05.07.2024,9.0,"This is literally my reason for being fascinated by scifi movies. This movie is a gem and it deserves atleast a *9* from me. Out of all the Pros of the film, I may summarise them as :
1. Vfx is top notch for its time.2. After watching Alan Silvestri's name, you don't need to analyse more on the music stuff.3. Rhe plot is well written and well executed. No potholes, or bad/awkward moments.4. Screenplay was good.5. Even if the plot has extreme situations, good writing makes it better.This is, as far as I'm concerned, the best time travel movie I've witnessed.Lets appreciate it and give the makers what they deserve."

02.07.2024,10.0,"Why did they remove the half fence from all 3 of the movies, it added a different twist to the endings and kept everything in the correct court?I am now 73. Saw BTTF when it was first released. Instant classic, even if the so-called experts didn't see it at that time. Perfect foreshadowing. Perfect acting, not only by the major stars, but also by the bit players - Goldie Wilson, the clock tower lady, Lorraine's parents, Strickland, Dave and Linda, Marvin Berry, the Peabody family (you killed a pine!). Perfect dialogue with many repeatable and memorable lines or phrases - butthead, flux capacitor, what's a rerun?, who the hell is John F. Kennedy, give me a milk - chocolate, I'm your density, 1.21 giggawats, 88 miles per hour, we don't need roads, etc. Silvestri's score is one of the most recognizable in cinema history. When supplemented with Huey Lewis hits , and the Starlighter's songs, the music is also a perfect fit. Truly an iconic film which has, and will always remain one of the greatest feel good movies ever."

24.06.2024,10.0,"The Delorian is such a fun vehicle and I love the way they use it in this movie! Ten stars for sure. It reminds me of when I was a kid and when my father would quote the scenes from the movie. Michael did an amazing job as Marty McFly in Back to the Future. It will always remind me of the good old days when my pops says ""Roads, where we're going, we don't need roads."". And ""I finally invented something that works."" Haha. I would really like to see another version of this movie come out now! I hope that they come out with one eventually because it was absolutely amazing. 10/10. Anyways, great movie!"
23.06.2024,9.0,"Modern movie makers have so much to learn from this movie. After 15min everything is setup, we know all the characters, the later pay off is ready to go, and everything is well written, no dialogue is wasted and there are no modern sensitivity issues. And, although we do not know it watching this movie, the sequels are already setup too. Great filmmaking.The movie has great pace, a lot of things happen, but everything feels logical and to the point.A few negatives of course. Especially from a modern point of view. The computer graphics do not hold up, some of the time travel shenanigans does not work (since we know what happens in ""the future""). But perhaps the only real negative is how campy and basic everything feels. I also feel the sets are not always on point.From one of the best movie years of all time, 1985, this classic and mastery of filmmaking is of course to this day still very much watchable.A 9/10 and a must see for every lover of great cinema."
18.06.2024,7.0,"In the mid-1980s, screenwriters Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had a great idea. Wouldn't it be fun to make a film about a young guy who travels back in time and meets his own parents? When his folks are also teenagers, that is? Unfortunately, their enthusiasm was not shared by a single soul in Hollywood. No one wanted to invest money in such a whacky project. But then, when Zemeckis scored a hit with ""Romancing the Stone"" everything changed. Suddenly every studio in town wanted to do business with the two friends.Robert Zemeckis started shooting ""Back to the Future"" in November 1984. From the beginning, Eric Stoltz was supposed to have the lead role. But although Stoltz was an excellent actor, the director soon realized that he wasn't the right man for the part. So, Zemeckis turned instead to Michael J. Fox, star of the immensely popular sitcom ""Family Ties"". And luckily, Fox was keen to do the job. Even though it meant working on two gruelling projects at the same time.When Michael J. Fox sets off on his time-traveling trip, he uses a gleaming, modified DeLorean. However, that wasn't the case in Zemeckis and Gale's original script. The two authors had actually intended that the journey would start in a converted refrigerator (?) out in the hero's kitchen. Soon, however, the two scriptwriters realized that this could cause problems. Imagine if some kid was inspired by the movie and got trapped inside the family's fridge.Not surprisingly, ""Back to the Future"" became a smash hit, even surpassing ""Romancing the Stone"" at the box office. The film also made Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale the hottest scriptwriting team in Hollywood. In addition, John DeLorean sent a letter thanking the filmmakers for immortalizing his futuristic car. But the biggest proof of the movie's popularity was that Universal Pictures installed ""Back to the Future"" rides in their theme parks in California and Florida."
15.06.2024,8.0,"I saw this movie enough times I lost count. I don't want to watch ""Back to the Future"" ever again unless there is a version which has Elisabeth Shue in on it ;) I like the first movie a lot, but it isn't the best movie in the series. The best character in this movie is that little, dog Einstein who seem to have started this adventure in the first place :) I wanted to see more of this dog. The second best character in this movie is none other than Doc I reckon who still looks the same in 1985 :) And so does Mr Strickland :) I like George in this movie, but I wanted him to be a man. George was too much of a wimp! I did like the other characters especially Biff Tannen, the bully, but I wanted to see Biff's Grandma :) Even what the inside of his home looks like. You saw Biff's garage. I like manure also :) Back to the Future is an excellent movie. 9/10."
13.06.2024,10.0,"Definitely NOT the best movie ever made, kinda sloppy and barely cracks top 15. It is indeed simple and superficial, plus I gotta agree on the fact that this might not be actual science fiction. Still, my childhood thrived on this franchise and I still get excited rewatch after rewatch. Furthermore, this movie was the first piece of fiction to make me love the 50s and 80s and in general vintage culture.So, if I have to rate cold-blooded on technical quality only, without letting feelings interfere? Well, I'm afraid it's a 6 at best.But if I have to be honest, cinema is more than just technique, so from the heart I'd say it's a 10.And only a chicken wouldn't follow his heart."
11.06.2024,7.0,"I recently watched a movie with a simple linear story in the time travel genre that I found really enjoyable. The movie revolves around a teenage boy named Marty who helps a scientist named Doc Brown test his time machine. However, Marty ends up traveling back in time and has to find his way back to the present.The movie's plot, while simple, still holds up and can be quite enjoyable. However, I felt that compared to more recent time-travel movies with complex and interesting storylines, this one may seem a bit basic. The plot revolves around a teen helping another teen get his dream girl and stand up to his bully but with time travel involved. This plot didn't work for me. But I didn't regret watching it.The acting in the movie was generally good, although I felt that the actors who played George and Lorraine overacted in their scenes. The cinematography was impressive for its time, and the music added to the overall enjoyment of the film. The pacing of the movie was just right, not too fast or slow.Overall, I found the movie fun to watch, but I was hoping for a more complex or thrilling storyline, rather than the teen drama that it turned out to be. I'd rate this movie a 7 because of its simple plot, but otherwise, it's a good watch."
04.06.2024,10.0,"Generation spanning movie. Kids, teens, adults, olders all love it. It has no wasted scenes, no bad dialog really, and no reliance on special effects.I can't really think of another movie so perfect for what it was. End Game maybe as the pinnacle super hero movie to end the MCU reign maybe.Part 2 suffered from no Crispin Glover. He really had the great tones and mannerisms for a foil for Marty.Everyone knows at least some lines from this movie. Everyone literally. A true gem.I see local Deloreans set up to look like the car from this movie. It draws more visitors than a typical lambo. I just added the last paragraph, true as it is, to meet the character requirements of the review."

Honestly all the actions in this movie can be short films they're so entertaining! #2 the score, Alan Silversti is a musical prodigy, every theme suits the moment and character, my favorite is Marty's letter it's so beautiful it has so much heart and emotion. #3 the development. The development in the characters is amazing, everyone gets a moment to shine, my favorite is George McFlys because he finally grew a pair and stood up to biff in a badass way. #4 set up and pay off. Set up and pay off is a very common thing to find in a script but for whatever reason not a lot of them use them, but THIS movie REALLY knows how to use it, Every single character or something in the background gets a time to shine, even things you won't even think about!

10.04.2024,9.0,"I just watched Back to the Future (1985), a sci-fi comedy in which a teenager called Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is transported to 1955 by a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his scientist buddy Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd).The movie is an excellent blend of humor and action. Marty's 80s fashion clash with 50s style is funny, as are his attempts to fit in. The unexpected bond Marty has with his parents is at the center of the story. He views them in a completely new light, recognizing that they weren't always boring grownups.Back to the Future isn't all fun and games. It cleverly delves into issues of family, destiny, and the strength of friendship. The special effects, while not mind blowing by today's standards, but it hold up surprisingly well and perfectly capture the magic of time travel. This movie is a timeless classic. It's a crowd-pleaser with something for everyone action, laughs, and a touch of heartwarming sentimentality."
07.04.2024,9.0,"Who else could have played these characters? Each character was perfectly cast, acted and memorably written. Equally memorable is the timeless story, exciting pacing, comedy and music. The only real problem is why Doc and Marty are friends. They make a great team, but have nothing in common. Marty doesn't want to be a scientist and Doc Brown isn't a musician or was one. How did they meet? I also don't know why Doc set the clocks 25 minutes slow. He didn't know Marty was coming over. In fact, one of the clocks on the ground by the plutonium case is still correct time. The DeLorean time machine is still cool and so is the rest."
29.03.2024,10.0,"Just kidding! It is one of the best films ever made. Lea Thompson was so hot. I would ""park"" with her anyday of the week, and twice on Sundays. Doc Brown is hypocritical about knowing too much about one's own future. It is weird that Marty McFly (presumably a minor in high school) is friends with a single old man scientist. Crispin Glover is probably the best part of the movie. That dude is ultra strange! I want to see the Eric Stolz version of the film. He apparently was Marty originally and filmed a lot of the movie before he was replaced by poor Parkinson poster-boy Michael J. Fox. Truly sad what happened to Fox in real life. He was a rising star and could have done a lot more with his career. But, such is life. 88 miles per hour!"

And at the last moment, they reveal this time loop as if it were a big thing and expect us to be amazed at their intelligence.I know it doesn't come close to being scientifically logical or perfect. But by using time travel as a tool, it tells a story with heart, about friendship, family, love, courage, and adding great comedy elements. All the acting is very successful. Especially Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd perform phenomenal performances while making you feel the friendship between the young man and the mad scientist that will warm your heart."

It cleverly intertwines elements of adventure, comedy, and drama, showcasing the journey of Marty McFly, who is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean created by his eccentric friend, Dr. Emmett Brown. While the concept of time travel was brilliantly executed, offering a fresh take on the genre, some aspects, like the exaggerated confrontation with the Libyans, felt overly dramatized and slightly disconnected from the storyline. Despite a few narrative discrepancies, the film remains an entertaining experience, rich in creativity and filled with memorable moments that have stood the test of time.

07.01.2024,8.0,"I recently enjoyed watching the iconic film Back to the Future, and it was nothing short of amazing. The storyline was captivating, with every scene building up the tension and making me want to know what happens next. The characters were incredibly well-developed, and their unique personalities and quirks made them all the more relatable and memorable.One of the things that stood out to me was the attention to detail in the time-travel aspect of the movie. Seeing how the filmmakers managed to weave in all the little details and make it all seem believable was awe-inspiring. The result was an engaging and entertaining movie that kept me on the edge of my seat.I particularly loved the chemistry between the characters and the humor sprinkled throughout the film. Michael J.

03.01.2024,,"In the 1980s, an experiment by a weird scientist turns out to be faulty. It leads to his teenaged pal going back in time to the 1950s where he is forced to reunite the younger version of his parents. The movie is, for better and sometimes for worse, a rich, fascinating document of the era that produced it. President Reagan was famously a huge fan, and not just because we see one of his films - ""Cattle Queen of Montana,"" the 1954 Western in which he starred opposite Barbara Stanwyck - being advertised on a 1955 Hill Valley theater marquee. With its extended flashback to the '50s from the vantage of the '80s, ""Back to the Future"" taps into the very ethos of the Reagan presidency, or part of it anyway: a spirit of pioneering technological advancement married to a wellspring of nostalgia for ostensibly simpler times."
01.01.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is an undisputed classic of cinema and science fiction as a whole. The film still works as an entertaining work, however, that doesn't mean it isn't a product of its time. The way the narrative is executed, the comedy is inserted and even how the visuals are displayed is, without a shadow of a doubt, dated. Does this mean that the work is bad seen through today's eyes? No. The work well portrays its time and the vision of the future that society had. Everything here is a huge reflection of the 80s. Even so, the work doesn't become any less thought-provoking and fun. Every film will always be dated when seen decades later, but that doesn't make it bad.The film, from the beginning, tells the viewer, in an indirect way, what will happen at the end of this story. This is one of the strong points of this film. Back to the Future thinks about many details to make the story round, even if the script falls into problems presented in works that explore time travel. The most important detail of the narrative is exactly how everything is extremely connected. All the scenes presented during the film are important for the development of the narrative and show importance again throughout it. Small details shown in small scenes always return to close the story in a satisfactory way and still leave a hook for a continuation.During many moments the small details presented are not said by the characters, but shown by small images in the foreground. The film takes advantage of small occasions to develop the narrative for the viewer, even though these details often don't seem important at first. Some scenes perfectly demonstrate the differences between the past and future using only the scenery and signs.Back to the Future is a brilliant work that marked its time and is still remembered today as a great classic. The film is extremely fun and its comedic moments are wonderful. The experience of watching this film is unique and becomes even more special when reviewed."

31.12.2023,10.0,"Back to the Future is directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film portrays Marty McFly, a high school student who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955, inadvertently disrupting his parents' first meeting and attracting his mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by rekindling his parents' romance and with the help of his eccentric inventor friend Doc Brown return to 1985.This movie is a phenomenal film. The music is fantastic. I love the song ""The Power of Love."" I love the storyline, the acting is fantastic, the comedy, and I love Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly. I love this movie so much."
20.12.2023,8.0,"Hey those days, hey..
I watched the movie, which is the same age as me, years ago, and I know that I loved it as far as I vaguely remember. It is one of the immortal works that leaves an entertaining taste in our subconscious whenever it is mentioned, just like Kemal Sunal's movies. Years later, yesterday, as a middle-aged person with children, I was at the market with my children. We watched it as a movie as a family. I'm sure my children felt similar feelings and maybe they will make a similar comment years later. It is definitely one of those productions that never gets old even after years pass.As for the film, it is one of the cornerstone films of cinema, one of the masterpieces of the master Robert Zemeckis. It is a very high-quality film in many aspects such as the scenario, acting, locations, decors, sequences, music, and clothes. It is a great film that is far ahead of the technology of that day, the likes of which I think are difficult to film even today. A movie... Immersiveness, excitement, action is always at the highest level and the tempo never slows down... Old movies had this aspect and I think this is the biggest deficiency of today's movies..."
13.12.2023,6.0,"To be honest, most of the time I understand the reason when a particular film is very highly appreciated by audiences and critics and at the same time is not my type. In this case, however, I do not find logic. Not that the film is bad. It's funny, it's watchable, and the main characters are colorful and memorable. Somehow, though, it didn't grab me all that much. I didn't find it super funny, adventurous or surprising enough. In short, nothing new under sky. Well, yeah, but that's not how most people feel.Weird.Well, at the end of the day, the important thing is that when we take the time to do something, we enjoy it as much as possible, and I'm glad that Back to the Future (1985) achieved that multiple times. In my case - I'm not disappointed, it was an OK movie, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it unless you're a fan of a particular person involved in this project or something like that.Final score: 6/10."
13.12.2023,10.0,"Great memorable movie. I like to watch that old man over and over again and he is constantly traveling through time. But the movie should have continued and newer episodes and series were made from it, but these versions are still popular with people after years, but the newer episodes can deal with modern technology and time travel. Maybe everything will be more attractive with the replacement faces of that old man, we like the new faces more and I hope it will be seen more and more. Film music can also be interesting. Pay attention to this series and produce new episodes with new actors that travel in time but also deal with new technology. Think about it along with music."
18.11.2023,9.0,"Back To The Future' is a great movie. It has an incredible energy and remains an ""innocent"" film. The music is great, and it has a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Some might argue that the time travel aspect is not plausible, but I think that's missing the point. The movie is meant to entertain, and it does that incredibly well. However, it's not just mindless entertainment. The film cleverly touches on some interesting themes and uses some ideas from Oedipus Rex's story in a funny way.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the mad scientist is hilarious, and Michael J. Fox completely embodies the character of Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy, and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is charming, and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is a timeless classic. It's been over 23 years since it was made, and it still has yet to lose its appeal. It's unfortunate that movies like this aren't made anymore, but thankfully, we can always revisit them. That's why they're classics."
16.11.2023,10.0,"Probably one of the greatest films ever made during the 80's, still holds up today. I can't think of anyone who grew up during my time that didn't love this film. A true classic, the story was great, along with the characters, and the soundtrack. It was the perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy,action. Doc Brown (Lloyd) invents a time machine using a DeLorean, to escape some Libyan terrorists after the Doc, McFly (Fox) goes back in time to 1955, and must use the assistance of 1955 Doc Brown to get back to 1985. Doesn't get much better than this as it appeals to all ages. Followed by 2 sequels part 2 is forgettable, but part 3 just as entertaining as original. 5/5."
13.11.2023,8.0,"What a classic gem this movie is
Yesterday, today and tomorrow
So many unforgettable lines and iconic scenes
Started today the trilogy and what a start this first movie is
Of course I knew the basics of the plot and even saw some scenes previous in life but now in watching the three movies no distractions from start to finish
The characters are awesome and the concept so pure. Very well executed considering it was the mid 80s
Marty and the Doc. What a Duo what a great movie
Back to the future is a classic movie from a classic saga that will remain relevant through the history of movies and makind."
13.11.2023,10.0,"Back to the future has fantastic characters and enjoyable story telling couldn't be better.The soundtrack is just perfect for the theme of the film. Michael J. Fox l did a spectacular job playing a relatable teenager living the dream. Christopher Lloyd's character Dr. Emmett Brown was very entertaining to watch I think he did a brilliant job with role and I believe no one could do it better.It makes me happy that 38 years later this film still hasn't lost its charm and holds a special place in people's hearts truly a timeless movie.Big thanks to Robert Zemeckis, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and the many others that made this movie possible.My favourite film till I die."
03.11.2023,8.0,"This film is a classic in its own right; Although it was not the first film to talk about time travel, it was the first to offer a lovable experience with funny characters where from various sources we obtained comic relief and at the same time the opportunity to embrace circumstances that our protagonists would experience. There are several sequences that have made history and the key for director Zemeckis is to offer, with his master pulse, a perfect form to an idea that in other hands would be mediocre. As a film it has not aged too well since we have become accustomed to the exaggeration resulting from the abundance of visual effects and the poverty of scripts that makes us more exquisite and impatient. Despite this, it is a good film in every sense."
01.11.2023,9.0,"Back to the future is a Classic movie that I've heard about for couple of times didn't really get the hype UNTIL nowThe Story is the BEST aspect of this movie the whole Back to the future idea is Very good ,Marty McFly and Doc are both amazing characters and very well written with some funny scenes here and there and there are a lot of chemistry between them which just makes this movie even more good and I want to note that the character development of those 2 are neat and well done.There are some Funny scenes here and there and I Really liked those and one of my favourite aspects of this very good movie.It has some very awkward scenes which are really interesting to see and quite laughable even though it's weird and if you see the movie you will know why there are some weird but good scenes 😆Overall SUCH an AMAZING adventure and I am looking forward to see the next one idk when but probably will see it because this movie is AMAZING! 9/10 DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!."
27.10.2023,9.0,"There are simply these films that have something magical about them. The magic of cinema - images, stories, characters that could enchant you, especially as a child. You were immersed in another world and sat in front of the TV with your mouth open. That was exactly the feeling I had when I saw ""Back To The Future"" for the first time.And the amazing thing is that I can still feel this feeling today when I watch the films.Even when the first notes of the magnificent score are heard, I get goose bumps.Immediately I am carried away into a world where I feel at ease and can forget everything around me. Hardly any other film has such an incredible charm as ""Back To The Future"" and its successors.This first film in particular is close to perfection for me. You can't tell a time travel story much better, more charming, wittier, more exciting, more intelligent than Robert Zemeckis does in this film. The plot is brilliant from beginning to end and there is not one scene that I find unnecessary or don't like.In addition, the strip offers simply incredible highlights, where you would like to rewind right away. For example, the appearance of Marty when he plays ""Johnny B. Goode"" at the ball, just fabulous. Or the skateboard scene, great.But not only the individual scenes, but in general this atmosphere, especially in the later course, when the action takes place in the 50s, is wonderful with the very beautiful backdrops. With Marty McFly and Doc Brown, of course, you have one of the most iconic movie duos of all time anyway, and with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, two outstanding actors who play it so well that they will forever be associated with these roles of a lifetime.Conclusion: Is there such a thing as the perfect film? Probably not, but ""Back To The Future"" is for me probably a strip that comes closest to it. And the best thing is that there are two more parts to follow, which are also really good and make up a totally round trilogy, which fortunately has been left as it is until today..."
24.10.2023,10.0,"Whenever I feel down and out about the present, I pop in the ol BTTF time machine, and am instantly transported to a better time, when things were only as serious as making sure the time continuum wasn't forever disrupted. Memorable characters, forever repeatable dialogue, and music that could make even Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan sing with glee! Having only first watched this one on VHS and not seeing it theaters, I can still feel that era whenever I catch this on tv. It is the encapsulated pleasures and atmosphere of all things 1980's. If only we had those hoverboards and self-lacing shoes by now...10/10."
18.10.2023,7.0,"My whole entire life I've had to hear what a masterpiece 'Back to the Future' is. Well, after 32 years I thought it's about time I finally watched it. Is it a masterpiece? No. It's a perfectly fine movie is what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.It's also a sign of the times. Similar to 'Indiana jones', people think it's a better film than what it is because 80s movies were so incredible bland. Time travel offers up a huge range of opportunities in terms of directions to go with your film. This film barely scrapes the barrel.Also the stakes never feel very high. The nature of the film is incredibly safe and so any audience member with half a brain knows exactly how everything is going to turn out.Truly great films have you on the edge of your seat. I never felt that way in this movie. I was simply along for the very safe ride.All that said, it's not a bad film. It just isn't what people think it is. 7/10."
16.10.2023,10.0,"One of the best movies I have seen, I like it a lot and every time I have time I watch it again, I really like the role that all the actors have, they give a special touch to the movie, everything is very similar to what one was actually in. Future it would be great if one day something like this could be done in real life.The roles that I like the most are the doctor, Martin and Biff, they are great at acting and they contributed a lot to this film, they gave it more essence, I think that without them the film would not be what it has been in this film for all time.I liked all 3 parts but the one I liked the most was the first because it made that introduction for what awaited us later with this great success."

12.09.2023,8.0,This is a spectacular film. A real classic in time. The storyline is terrific. I very much enjoyed watching this film. This is a great film for all viewers to watch. The cast selection is really precise and sensational.

12.09.2023,10.0,"Here in 2023 Back to the Future remains in the top 250 highest rated movies on IMDB and it is not difficult to see why. It's Great Scott, considering the technology and advancements the film industry has made since the year 1985, believe me this movie still holds its own. It is undoubtedly well written and entertaining and funny at times. Mostly bringing science fiction meets the adventurious with a dab of comedy to tiggle your taste buds.I remember as a young boy experiencing the ride in Universal Studios which only excelled my love for the films even more so. The DeLorean, i remember feeling the experience of being inside it all them years ago on the ride and let me tell you it was magical. The chemistry between the main protagonist Marty Mcfly and Doc Brown in contrast sets a tone of a father like son relationship with overwhelming love thrown in for good measure. On opposite sides of the coin yet on common ground of feeling outcast oddballs, somewhere down the timeline it just works so good. Every kids imagination is brought to life whilst every adult wonders of what they would do if given the opportunity to time travel. Back to the Future is the pinnacle of the time travelling genre in film, it invented the wheel and if it didn't it certainly took it further than ever before.Michael J. Fox is Marty McFly, there is no debate on that. I hear tellings of how they had to re-shoot scenes of Mcfly throughout the entire movie because the man they originally cast for Mcfly didn't get the character, or wasn't what they wanted. Christopher Lloyd plays the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown exquisitely conveying everything from mad scientist, to level headed thoughts of wisdom. The portrayal needless to say is spot on.Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have constructed a story for the ages that will truly stand the test of time and you will find yourself 'the audience' going Back to the future time and time again!"
08.09.2023,8.0,"Back to the Future is like the ultimate high-concept comedy adventure that takes you on a wild ride through the space-time continuum. We've got this guy Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) who's basically just trying to survive high school and keep his quirky family from turning into a bunch of losers. But then, he stumbles upon the eccentric Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who's like the love child of Einstein and a tornado. Doc's got a DeLorean, a flux capacitor, and a crazy plan to go back in time. Yeah, it's as nuts as it sounds.Marty and Doc jump in that stainless steel DeLorean and end up in the '50s, where things get... heavy. Marty has to make sure his parents fall in love or risk erasing his own existence. Talk about awkward family dynamics! But you know what's not awkward? The '80s and the '50s in a mashup and the hilarity that ensues! Marty and Doc are the ultimate odd couple, and their chemistry is electric. You just can't help but root for them, even when things get as complicated as deciphering the intricacies of alternate timelines, parallel universes, and the ever-elusive whereabouts of a misplaced almanac.But what really gets me is how this movie manages to balance sci-fi, comedy, and heart in one helluva entertaining package. You've got the classic '80s nostalgia dripping from every scene, and Marty's struggle to fit into the '50s is both hilarious and touching. The film's plot and pacing is so spot-on, and the script is full of clever time-travel paradoxes that'll make your head spin faster than the DeLorean's tires. Back to the Future takes us on a wild ride through the past, present, and future, all while serving up more laughs than 1.21 gigawatts of fun. It's got nostalgia, adventure, and that oh-so-'80s soundtrack. And let's not forget about that Johnny B. Goode guitar solo. It's a time-traveling, laugh-inducing, heart-warming adventure that'll have you shouting, ""Great Scott!"" in no time. So grab your hoverboard, put on your red puffer vest, and get ready to experience a classic that's as '80s as a Rubik's Cube and as funny as Doc Brown's hair on a windy day."
01.09.2023,10.0,"As I am familiar with Back to the Future I thought about wanting to look at it. As the film became the 30th Anniversary in 2015, the three films became a 30th Anniversary Trilogy celebrating the release of the first film which gained massive praise from critics and audience. Yes, I watched the whole trilogy in one day, believe or not, but I'm going to get these two later until I'm finished with the first film. Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back in time from 1985 to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes his mother's romantic interest. Dr. Emmett Brown aka. Doc, played by Christopher Lloyd, his friend and the inventor of the time-traveling DeLorean automobile, who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985. OK, so what people love about this film that has sense nowadays that I know this is a popular film and definitely the most popular Back to the Future film out of the trilogy. I love the story for what they've achieved with the first act where the story of the characters saying about what happened back in 1955 and when Marty is traveled in that year it goes what they usually do but not for Marty McFly 'cause he got hit by a car instead of George and now Lorraine, played by Lea Thompson, who now has the hots for him. Yeah, kinda weird while you think about it. For what I didn't know is that this film is used in pop culture such as what is ""Rick and Morty"" and that's all I know about that. I love the characters in which Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd plays along with the other actors. They both play fan favourite characters like Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is a typical teenager who accidentally went back in time in 1955 and he wants to get back in the year 1985. From what I heard that Michael J. Fox has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease which kinda sucks but he did continued work. Christopher Lloyd for many people know as an eccentric scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown aka. ""Doc"" who built the time machine made from the DeLorean and is my favourite character of the film. I bet many of you know his quotable line is ""Great Scott!"" Lea Thompson plays an innocent Lorraine McFly who falls for Marty and his mother in 1985. Crispin Glover is George McFly who is a teenager in 1955 and Marty's father in 1985. And then Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen, many people known him as the best character in franchise. His bully type really does suit the character really well and he throws in one of his catchphrases like ""What are you looking at, butthead?"", ""So, why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?"" and he hates being covered in manure. Also, I've heard the song ""The Power Of Love"" by Huey Lewis & The News and this is a good song. Christopher Lloyd appears in the music video as Doc Brown from the movie but what really caught me is Huey Lewis made a cameo appearance as one of the teachers. There's also a scene where Marty sings ""Johnny B. Goode"" by Chuck Berry. Yes, this song is in the 50's. In fact, Chuck was thinking about doing this song back in the mid 50's, believe it or not. You know, as much of these sci-fi movies that are popular at the time. Back to the Future is one of those movies you will have to see in the lifetime. It has great directing, fantastic writing, memorable characters, great performances and good effects. It boosted Robert Zemeckis' career up like he directed Romancing the Stone. This is one of my favourite films and my favourite sci-fi film of all time much like what others think of it when they put it in their Top 10 or many number movies. Do not miss this movie. Stay tuned for Back to the Future Part II. ""Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."""
29.08.2023,10.0,Whenever I am feeling down or sick or bored or happy or just feel like a good movie I turn to Back to the Future. It helps that this is a fairly family friendly movie that won't be too much for little ones watching. However my little thinks it's boring. Probably cuz I have made her watch it too many times to count.This is just a perfect movie in my opinion. Back in the 80's when they knew comedy didn't necessarily meant non stop fart jokes OR even that a comedy can be serious at times.The acting is top notch and has cemented Lloyd and Fox as one of my favorite acting duos of all time.Lots of action and adventure to be had can't recommend it enough.
18.08.2023,9.0,"(1985) Back To The Future
SCIENCE- FICTION/ ADVENTURE/ COMEDYCo-written and directed by Robert Zemeckis, fun science fiction adventure, and quite original any underdog can identify with centering on a chance to change the unsatisfying life one is experiencing into a better one by driving a time traveling car. Michael J Fox is perfect for the role who is unathletic and the only normal one in his family and Crispen Glover is perfect as the geeky dad, George McFly whose trying to provide the best for his family and Christopher Llyod is convincing as the kooky scientist after his likable persona he created while he was on the hit show ""Taxi""! Interesting note that the scene which involved the skateboarding scene while hanging onto the end of a vehicle doesn't really work in real life for I remembered someone once tried to mimic that stunt in real life during the time of this film's popular release and he ended up in the hospital and not functioning the same, meaning that it's one of those things that can be made possible in films but shouldn't be done in real life."
11.08.2023,10.0,"I like the Back To The Future series. They are very interesting plots to keep you wanting to watch from start to end. Not a lot of movies can do that but when you start watching Back To The Future you want to stay until it's over. You don't want to have to get up and down multi tasking. You will want to sit down and watch the movie. Maybe make some popcorn and grab a drink so it will be like you are at the theatre watching. I don't want to give away any spoilers so I won't go into detail, but Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) goes back in time and he has to be extra careful not to do anything that could alter the time line before he gets to go back to his time. Woth the watch."
07.08.2023,9.0,"It was an adventure of classic proportions Robert Zemeckis created when he combined clever time-travel writing with a wonderful mixture of 1950s Americana worship and an era-defining depiction of 1980s youth culture - a tribute to skateboards and walkmans. Amidst Michael J. Fox' youthful energy, Christopher Lloyd's in-your-face eccentricity and Crispin Glover's wonderful idiosyncrasy, Back to the Future did a magnificent job bridging the generation gap for mid-80s youngsters, whom John Hughes would claim weren't being understood by their parents in The Breakfast Club a few weeks later. In Back to the Future, it's arguably the other way around, but the end-result of Zemeckis' bridge-building is in many ways the same; an insight into the fact that being a hormonal teenager presented many of the same challenges in the 1950s as it did in the 1980s, or the 2020s, for that matter. And Back to the Future also keeps you completely, A-to-Z entertained by throwing impressive visuals and savvy antics at you from start to finish. A perfect film for parents and kids, even today."
06.08.2023,8.0,"Oh, what does one say about 'Back to the Future'? I might as well say just one word and conclude my review: CLASSIC!Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly - just a regular kid who dreams of becoming a rock star. His girlfriend is Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) and his best friend is the eccentric inventor Professor Doc (Emmett) Brown (wonderfully portrayed by Christopher Lloyd). His Mom is a bit conservative, although she doesn't mind a shot of Vodka, while his Dad is (sadly) a real loser, and has been a pushover since high school.One evening Doc shows Marty his latest invention - a time machine, built in a DeLorean. Doc obtained plutonium required for his time machine to work from Libyan terrorists, who are in pursuit of him. When Doc is shot, and Marty fears for his own life, he jumps in the DeLorean and accidentally goes back in time to 1955. Here, Marty meets his parents before they were sweethearts, and things get more than just a bit awkward for Marty when his mom falls for him!Nothing in 'Back to the Future' happens by chance. This is an incredibly well set-up movie, and the dialogue is very important, so you have to pay close attention. Everything here has a purpose, and plays a pivotal part in the movie. From the clever script to the incredible production design, great visuals and superb acting, this is one of the best fantasy adventure comedies.'Back to the Future' has a truly unique concept for its time, and certainly stood the test of time. Even by today's standards, the film still looks amazing. Off course, the fact they mostly used practical effects instead of CGI also makes a huge difference. Back when the movie came out, no doubt everyone wanted a (time-traveling) DeLorean!!I loved the way everything went wrong, and how everything fell into place again. And what a wonderful climax. This is an entertaining movie for the whole family!"
