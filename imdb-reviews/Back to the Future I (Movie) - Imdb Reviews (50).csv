03.08.2025,10.0,"This is the best movie ever, everyone rate it 10, great casting it should be #1, great story, great direction by Robert Zemeckis and incredible entertainment. All time adventure. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the best movie duo ever.Soundtrack is beautiful and iconic. Editing and production wow.From Einstein to The Hill Valley courthouse, from Johnny B. Goode to 88 mph scenes... I can go on and on, so many incredible details and entertaining ""heart-pounding"" scenes in this movie.The Shawshank redemption is nothing compared to this movie. Maybe it's not nothing but definitely is not better than BTTF.This one with BTTF part 2 and part 3 = The Best Trilogy of all Time."
03.05.2025,5.0,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Marty McFly is a very likable, well-acted character. The film starts out pretty well, introducing Marty's family and other characters, although it does take some time before the time travelling (from 1985 to 1955) occurs - The scenes with the Libyan terrorists at the parking lot seem to drag on and on. Also, what are Libyan terrorists doing in Los Angeles in the 1980s? Anyways...I would've liked to know how Doc met Marty. I mean, how would a 'cool' kid like Marty be friends with a 50+ year old geeky old guy? This isn't really a flaw, but just an honest contemplation. Speaking of the two, the ending dragged for too long. I won't spoil it. But the scene with Marty and Doc waiting for the lightning to strike at the clock became nauseating. I'm guessing the creators were just trying to show off the special effects and sound effects, which seemed pretty good for that time. But I didn't like it and that sequence killed the film's pace. Also, the movie ended in a way that leads to the sequel. So for those expecting a standalone film, you will not be satisfied.The music score by Alan Silvestri is classic and memorable. The characters are also very likable, hence why the film has a classic status. But I still feel it was let-down by the drawn out, bloating ending sequence near the clock tower."
23.02.2025,8.0,"Back to the Future is a near-perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy, and adventure that remains just as entertaining today as it was in 1985. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and featuring a fantastic cast, this film captures the essence of fun, excitement, and nostalgia in one unforgettable time-travel story.Michael J. Fox shines as Marty McFly, a relatable and charismatic teenager who finds himself accidentally sent back to 1955 in a DeLorean-turned-time-machine. His chemistry with Christopher Lloyd's eccentric Doc Brown is nothing short of iconic, making for some of the most memorable moments in film history. The story is fast-paced, filled with humor, and has just the right amount of emotional weight, especially when Marty tries to fix his parents' relationship.Alan Silvestri's triumphant score and the '80s rock soundtrack give the movie its energetic feel, while the practical effects and clever script make the time-travel mechanics easy to follow. If there's any flaw, it's that some of the science is more fantasy than logic, but honestly, that's part of the fun.Overall, Back to the Future is an endlessly rewatchable classic that still holds up today. It's got adventure, comedy, and heart-all wrapped up in a thrilling time-travel journey."
18.02.2025,10.0,"Back to the Future is a film that has firmly secured its place in my heart, and it's one I can watch on repeat without ever growing tired of it. From the very first time I saw it as a kid, I was instantly hooked. I know the entire movie by heart-the dialogue, the iconic scenes, and every memorable moment have been etched in my memory.The genius of Robert Zemeckis shines through as we follow the time-traveling adventures of Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox. As a child, I couldn't help but develop the biggest crush on Marty. His charm, wit, and rebellious spirit made him the quintessential hero for young audiences like me. Who could resist that iconic skateboard ride or the perfect blend of bravado and heart?This film is a true classic that masterfully combines science fiction, adventure, and comedy, all wrapped up in an engaging and entertaining story. The concept of time travel, with its potential for mishaps and adventures, captivated my imagination and sparked countless daydreams about what I would change in my own timeline.Back to the Future isn't just a film I watched; it's an experience that has stayed with me throughout my life. Its themes of friendship, perseverance, and the casual certainty that life can lead to unexpected twists are messages that resonate deeply. It's a film I hold dear to my heart, and sitting down to watch it always feels like visiting an old friend."
15.02.2025,10.0,"Back to the Future is the greatest film in every way. The characters are perfect and funny. The story is amazing and some-what grounded. The music is absolutely magnificent. Doc and Marty are the perfect duo (being solar opposites) and references and little Easter eggs you can catch on your future viewings are absolutely mind blowing and comes to show what a great screenplay Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale made. If your looking for a funny, sci-fi, romance, action, 80s classic look no further than Back to the Future. One of if not Steven Spielberg's best film ever made besides Jaws.""Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads."" - Dr. Emmett Brown."
08.02.2025,10.0,"Ultimate American summer blockbuster. Incredibly clever, nostalgia-packed, and never gets old. Just when it would seem that Steven Spielberg has touched all possible forms of fantasy, he comes up with another one that not only plucks, but plays a complete symphony, on the heartstrings. It's all fiendishly complicated but Zemeckis is an inventive filmmaker with a knack for the happy ending. Disney would have been proud of him -- and more than a little envious of an entertainment which takes a risk or two, and has a ball doing it. I loved it was timeless and I could gladly watch it over and over and over again."

07.01.2025,10.0,"This is a fun, irresistible and original film. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sophisticated. The cinematography, scenery and costumes are excellent. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in his role and so is Michael J Fox, he is also brilliant in his role as Marty Mc Fly. This is overally a brilliant film that is good in so many ways. Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect. The story is awesome. It is delivered cleverly and entertainingly. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something to watch."
05.01.2025,10.0,"I've never written a movie review, despite having watched so many that I've lost count. I was born in 1981, so when this movie came out, I was just a child. Over 40 years have passed, and I can confidently say that this is the movie I've watched the most times in my entire life. Every time I'm channel surfing and this movie is on, I simply can't resist watching it again. The remote stops right there. I think that says it all. For me, this is the best movie ever made.It doesn't fit into any specific genre, in my opinion. It's simply Back to the Future. For those who lived through the '80s and '90s, they'll surely understand its charm. For those who didn't, I don't have the insight to make any judgment, but I believe it's timeless."
30.12.2024,4.0,"In the mainstream Hollywood movies of the 1980s, America was a nation in the process of reconciliation. This reconciliation aims to repair the wounds inflicted on America by the movements of the 1960s and the divisions of the 1970s.So Hollywood in the 1980s tells the story of reconciliation between two generations. In the 1982 film ""The Golden Pond,"" not only did Henry Fonda's grandfather and grandson reach mutual understanding, but he also reached mutual forgiveness with his daughter, Jane Fonda, both in the film and in reality. In 1983, the once popular Star Wars series also reached its final chapter, in which the evil father Black Knight was finally influenced by his son Luke, who sacrificed himself to save him."
29.12.2024,10.0,This movie is a great start of a movie franchise and the writing is awesome. The characters are so greatly written in a way that makes total sense and the learning process is great. The time process doesn't really have any plot holes. The dad glow up is insane and the songs that are in it are amazing the post credit scene is a great way to leave a cliffhanger. It amazing that falling out of a tree and getting hit by a car lead his mother falling in love with him and him having to have his dad fight his high school bully for her to fall in love with him was a great come back for his wimpy character.

09.12.2024,10.0,"What else can really be said about Back to the Future? This beloved movie has been praised in so many ways over the years, that i cant even think of a original thing to say about it. It's a classic, a masterpiece of modern american cinema, one of the most rewatchable movies of all time. Michael J Fox is incredible, Christopher Lloyd is incredible, Lea Thompson is incredible, Crispin Glover is incredible, EVERYONE is incredible in this goddamn film! The direction, the script, etc... Everything is so tight and well put togheter, it's amazing! One of those rare ""lightning in the bottle"" moments in cinema history, when everything that was suppose to go right, GOES RIGHT!"
08.12.2024,10.0,"This was the movie that made me love science fiction movies. I was around 7 years old when I first watched it and I really enjoyed it. Years have passed since I first watched it, but I still watch the movie with the same admiration, it was really great. I thought the movie was pretty good for an 80's movie. The movie's story is also a very original and carefully written story. There are also many references to this movie (The first movie of the movie serie) in the other movies of the movie serie.It was truly one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, and also the best time travel movie I've ever seen. This movie is really worth watching I definitely recommend it to everyone."
01.12.2024,10.0,"The epitome of excellence in Hollywood, ""Back to the Future"" is timeless, inspiring, and memeable. The pace here is seamless, every moment has plot significance, and every word uttered is valuable and meaningful. This careful crafting of visual presentation, audible experience and narrative concept existed at a time of relative peace and stability in the American economy. Little did we know everything would go downhill from here: an era of complete uncertainty leading to massive corporate greed, a sharp drop in production quality, and an industry absorbed by politics instead of artform. The laisse faire attitude of 80s Hollywood management allowed for more directorial creativity and oversight, compared to the complicated and overzealous requirements demanded by today's itchy fingered producers and executives.""Back to the Future"" deals with very common human issues such as self-esteem, effort and maturity, all while presenting an intriguing premise, pressing matters, romance, friendship and conflict all rolled into one. If the definition of Art is ""the mirror we hold up to ourselves"" (Shakespeare, Hamlet), then the imitation of nature that this science fiction dramedy presents is among the best in the craft of filmmaking: It's not about the science or the fiction; it's about people.Today's world poses many threats to studio success: legal action can be taken if your production presents defamatory or misleading information; social backlash can arise from a lack of respect to the genre or franchise; studio acceptance can be jeopardized from simple misrepresentation of race or gender... what we have now is a literal minefield of judicial hurdles, social media timebombs and the precarious balancing of identity politics over qualification and competence in hiring. Its no wonder, then, that activists, poles, statistics and even artificial intelligence have taken center stage in the development of studio projects: every obstacle to success must be accounted for. The excessive hand holding has led to a soulless industry, one so obsessed with minutia, that its now incapable of seeing the forest from the trees. Art has completely left the building, replaced by obligation to pretense and the third quarter. Hopefully, future generations will rely on past productions, such as this one, for inspiration, guidance, and understanding of the human experience."
29.11.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is a near-perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, and adventure, earning high praise for its clever storytelling, memorable characters, and infectious energy. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg, this iconic film has stood the test of time, captivating audiences with its creativity and timeless appeal.The story follows teenager Marty McFly, played with charm and charisma by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a time machine invented by the eccentric Dr Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd. Marty's quest to return to 1985 becomes a race against time as he inadvertently disrupts his parents' first meeting, threatening his very existence.Fox delivers an effortlessly engaging performance, bringing humour and relatability to Marty as he navigates the past with a mix of resourcefulness and teenage awkwardness. Lloyd is equally outstanding as Doc, with his larger-than-life energy and wild-eyed enthusiasm creating one of cinema's most beloved characters. The dynamic between Marty and Doc is the heart of the film, with their unlikely friendship driving much of the story's charm.The script, co-written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, is a masterpiece of structure and wit, deftly weaving together humour, tension, and heartfelt moments. The way the film balances the high stakes of time travel with light-hearted comedy is nothing short of genius. From the hilariously awkward scenes with Marty's teenage mother to the nail-biting clock tower sequence, every moment feels perfectly calibrated.Alan Silvestri's iconic score amplifies the film's sense of adventure and wonder, while the 1980s rock hits, particularly Huey Lewis and the News' The Power of Love, give the film its unforgettable vibe. The production design is equally impressive, capturing both the 1980s and 1950s with meticulous attention to detail, making the time-jump feel immersive and authentic.The only minor drawback is that certain elements of the plot, particularly the more dated social dynamics, may not resonate as strongly with modern audiences. However, these moments do little to detract from the film's overall impact.In conclusion, Back to the Future is an endlessly entertaining and cleverly crafted film that continues to delight viewers of all ages. With its sharp humour, heartwarming story, and unforgettable performances, it has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films of all time. A near-flawless adventure that is as timeless as its title suggests."
21.11.2024,10.0,"Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack."
12.11.2024,9.0,"Back to the Future is a film that holds a special place in my heart, and watching it again recently reminded me why it's such a timeless classic. From the moment the iconic DeLorean roars to life, I was transported back to a world where time travel is not just a fantasy, but a thrilling adventure. The film's blend of humor, science fiction, and heartwarming moments creates an experience that resonates with audiences of all ages.Michael J. Fox's portrayal of Marty McFly is nothing short of iconic. His youthful exuberance and relatable struggles make him an endearing protagonist. And then there's Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown, whose eccentricity and wisdom provide the perfect counterbalance to Marty's character. Their chemistry is electric, and every scene they share is filled with laughter and genuine emotion.The screenplay is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving together themes of friendship, family, and the consequences of our choices. I found myself laughing at the clever nods to the 1950s culture while also appreciating the film's deeper messages. The way it tackles the idea of altering one's own past and the ripple effects that can have is both thought-provoking and entertaining.The soundtrack, particularly the unforgettable theme by Alan Silvestri, adds an extra layer of magic to the film. It's one of those scores that sticks with you long after the credits roll, evoking a sense of nostalgia and adventure.Watching Back to the Future in a packed theater, surrounded by fellow fans, was an experience I'll cherish. The collective gasps, laughter, and cheers made me realize how this film transcends generations. It's a movie that sparks joy, ignites conversations, and leaves you with a smile on your face.In a world where films often come and go, Back to the Future remains a shining beacon of creativity and fun. It's a film I can revisit time and time again, discovering new nuances with each viewing. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience this cinematic gem. It's not just a movie; it's a journey through time that you won't want to miss."
09.11.2024,8.0,"Balancing Sci Fi with Comedy and Drama is one of the hardest combinations in the entertainment industry, and 'Back to the Future' nails it almost perfectly. The blend of wit, charm and consideration creates a tasty and wholesome family movie with a sense of consequence for the character's actions.Michael J. Fox is sensational, giving that comical edge to take the pressure off you while also feeling human and grounded. Christopher Lloyd is marvellous. Crispin Glover is beautiful as this pathetic man at the centre at it all. Tom Wilson makes his first appearance although out of the three he has the least impact.The sense of place and atmosphere is striking, largely due to great well lit cinematography and steady handed screenplay. It's textbook brilliance for the period and deserving as a cultural icon."
03.11.2024,9.0,"Probably one of the best, if not the best, trilogies ever made and also one of my personal favourites. Always had a soft spot for this film since I was a little kid.Watching the film I could not but think about the brilliance of the script and the direction. I always trust Tarantino on this, as he says, the perfect movie.I don't know what makes this film great: the concept, the performances, the chemistry between Marty and Doc, the music, the 80's setting, the sci-fi elements, the romantic comedy elements-or maybe it's all of that? How can all of those elements coexist in one single film without destroying it?I guess that that's what would happen today, and it is not what happened in 1985, certainly not when you have Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis around."
18.10.2024,9.0,"Great time travel DMC DeLorean , memorable characters and very likable dialogues. And one that will stick in your head for a long time is Doc! It's a fun and feel-good movie. I've watched it since I was a kid and I've watched it over 10 times now and I'm still not bored of it. It's a really good memory. Although the rest of the series are fun, the first series is still the best. But there might be a downside, maybe only in the Dub zone of my country, some words are not translated correctly, so I had to find the English version to watch. When watching both languages, it's fun in different ways."
17.10.2024,10.0,"I just got done watching Back to the Future (1985) for the first time ever and I absolutely loved every single minute of this movie.Positives for Back to the Future (1985):
The movie's premise is absolutely brilliant to where you have this boy going back in time and see what the world was like when his parents were teenagers. This is a premise that has been done multiple times since this movie first came out and while some of them have come close, none have been able to capture the magic of this original movie. The other thing that makes this movie work is the cast of characters and the actors portraying them. First off you have Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly who is easily one of the best movie characters in the history of cinema and he's one of those characters who you easily relate to because of his natural on-screen presence and charisma. Then you have Christopher Lloyd as Emmett ""Doc"" Brown and this guy is one of the most entertaining and ecentric characters that you can't help but love him. I also enjoyed Crispin Glover as George McFly and Lea Thompson as Lorraine Baines McFly and their interactions with Marty are so fun to watch. Then you have Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen is one of the most easy to hate villains in cinematic history and he's not even one of these evil cartoonish villains that we see a lot in movies, he's just a big mean bully in high school and we all hate those people. The movie's score by Alan Silvestri is easily among one of the movie scores I've heard in any movie. The special effects for the time-travel sequences are phenomenal and they still hold up to this day. And finally, I just how good-natured this movie is with its approach and it's one of those comfort movies that you can watch at anytime in your life.Overall, Back to the Future (1985) is one of the greatest movies of all time.amd if you haven't watched this movie yet and then you need to watch it as soon as possible."
10.09.2024,7.0,This movie is a lot of fun the whole way through I love doc and Marty is a fun protagonist. The idea of what's going on and time travel has probably happened a lot but it stems from this and you can see why I think the ending is super sweet and how it just has full confidence and is like oh we have an idea for a sequel too is great cause it shows they had fun doing this and will do more which is great cause nowadays sequels feel forced and undeserved but this is just a whole lot of fun and def deserving of a sequal i remember watching 2 & 3 when I was younger and I'm excited to revisit them this month before they leave Netflix.
08.09.2024,8.0,"Back to the Future is a movie ahead of its time, utilizing an array of incredible effects that were unseen for its era. The narrative is super simple yet captivating, with a well-constructed story that avoids leaving any plot holes. The performances are amazing, and it has become an iconic film in pop culture.Elements like the Delorean and the concept of a time machine through a car are very original and practical, featuring a highly empathetic and human protagonist, with flaws and merits. The only downside to the film is certain sexist aspects of the time, based on the culture in which it was released."
07.09.2024,10.0,"Classic one of my favorite childhood movie, Literally, one of the best serious picture of all time. I have been watching this movie so many times, including the movie. The other the fantasy is going back literally one of the greatest idea. The acting is phenomenal and the effect horse back at the time revolutionary. I wish the day really did another movie in the series, this movie is enjoyable and it's not too long. It's perfect in terms of timing. I don't understand why all the new movies it's over three hours and you can really make movie in 90 minutes., Recommended to all the young generation that did not grew up on this movie."
06.09.2024,9.0,"Great 80's film. Hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually.9/10."
05.09.2024,10.0,"Back to the Future is one of those very nostalgic films.I remember exactly the day I received a box set with the three films from a friend of my mother. As it was late at night, I couldn't run the marathon. The next day I watched them all and immediately fell in love.All the settings, characters and stories leave everything characteristic and original, mainly due to the time in which it was made.Michael J. Fox Christopher Lloyd form a duo with perfect chemistry. No wonder they are called for interviews and lectures about the three films to this day.If there's one tip I can give to parents of children old enough to understand the story, it's: don't waste any more time, have a movie session at home to watch these three classics of world cinema with your children."
05.09.2024,10.0,"This is how a movie should be done. It's perfection from start to finish. I remember the first time that I saw it and I remember my house, the tv, the food that I was eating the happiness the nostalgia. If anyone doesn't like Back to the future he/she must be empty inside. There's no way to not love this perfection.The cinematography the story the comedy the actors everything is perfect and there's even 1 second of the movie that is boring. Everything is fast paced. The special effects even in 2024 are perfectly ok. This is a movie that I watched 50 times and I will continue to watch it in the coming years."

25.08.2024,9.0,"I love this film and can rewatch it every day if I can. The critiques of this film usually have a complaint about the ""scifi"" aspect of it, whether it justifies the science behind time travel or not. I would say that Back to the Future is like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone. It falls more on the adventure-comedy genre than science-fiction. Everything that's happening here taken place in a fifth dimension that is beyond science and superstition.You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of imagination."
23.08.2024,10.0,"I recently watched Back to the Future (1985) on Netflix. The storyline follows Marty McFly, a high school student dealing with the fallout of his father being bullied by his boss, which affects the entire family dynamic. His best friend, a quirky scientist, has been working on a time travel experiment. When Marty is called to help test the invention, the experiment works-but with tragic consequences, as the scientist is killed, and Marty is accidentally sent back in time. Now, Marty must find a way to change the course of history to help his family while also figuring out how to return home.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), the film stars Michael J. Fox (Teen Wolf), Christopher Lloyd (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), Lea Thompson (Howard the Duck), Crispin Glover (Willard), and Tom Wilson (Action Jackson).Back to the Future is 80s nostalgic gold in every way-storyline, characters, soundtrack, comedic elements, and its optimistic take on the core premise. The entire film is beautifully written, with Marty McFly being an easy character to root for. Michael J. Fox perfectly captures Marty's carefree and fun-loving nature. Crispin Glover delivers an underrated performance as Marty's quirky dad, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as the eccentric scientist. The depiction of the 1950s is pure fun, and the idea of a son inadvertently impacting his parents' relationship is both clever and engaging. The weaving together of time travel and family plots comes together seamlessly, culminating in a heartwarming full-circle ending. The Huey Lewis and the News soundtrack is iconic, and it's impossible not to love this film.In conclusion, Back to the Future is wholesome American cinematic gold and an absolute must-see. I would score it a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
16.08.2024,5.0,"This story is essentially a small, weak, dumb kid sort of accidentally travels back in time, makes irrationally bad decisions and then somehow triumphs in the end.When I saw this movie as a kid I thought it was pretty silly but fun, and if I was writing IMDB reviews in the 90s I probably would have rated it a 7/10. For anyone with a mind remotely based in science or logic nearly everything comes off too stupid or illogical to enjoy this movie. Marty McFly makes a terrible decision in nearly every situation and seems to keep forgetting that he traveled back In time. I can see how the bottom half of the population would identify with this idiotic protagonist and how some fan boys would love these movies despite their flaws, but I don't understand how anyone not in those categories could rate any of these movies above a 6.Some specifics that I don't think qualify as spoilers:
-Marty's family photo (from the ""future"") starts to fade based on his actions. This makes ZERO sense; if you altered your future and negated your existence, you wouldn't exist and the photo wouldn't exist. If they wanted to try and make scientific sense it would have been more like Schr枚dinger's Cat where Marty disappears intermittently and the photo changes.-After traveling back in time Marty seems to never remember he came from the future and makes every silly blunder possible to create issues for himself. He makes no attempt to blend in when it matters most, and in every situation he seems just as confused and flabbergasted that he's in the last, even though it's very clear he knows he is. It's sort of like he's willfully ignorant and is pretending to not remember he went back in time at only the worst times (aka bad writing)."
05.08.2024,10.0,"This is the greatest movie I have ever seen, my favorite of all time. I just love this movie so much. It has everything a great movie needs. A great cast, a great script, great characters, great plot, great scenes, great everything. From the beginning to the end, it is amazing. I just get a great, indescribable feeling when I watch it. Every time I can, I view it. There is quite literally nothing wrong with it. As Michael J. Fox said, ""It's ironic that a movie about time travel is timeless."" I totally agree. I hope, some day, I can show my children this movie, and they will love it as well. And as Forrest Gump said (which is kinda ironic because Robert Zemeckis directed both Forrest Gump and Back To The Future,) ""That's all I have to say about that."""
22.07.2024,10.0,"*Back to the Future* is more than just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that captures the essence of imagination and adventure in a way that transcends generations. Released in 1985 and directed by the iconic Robert Zemeckis, this sci-fi classic invites viewers to take a whirlwind ride through time, expertly blending humor, heart, and a sprinkle of science fiction.The film follows the antics of Marty McFly, played with a perfect blend of charm and awkwardness by Michael J. Fox, who finds himself accidentally transported to the past via a DeLorean time machine invented by the eccentric yet endearing Doc Brown, portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd. The premise is deceptively simple-Marty must ensure that his parents fall in love to secure his own existence-yet it unfolds into a labyrinth of hilarious complications, clever twists, and thought-provoking reflections on choices and consequences.One of the film's greatest triumphs is its ability to resonate emotionally, as Marty wrestles not only with the bizarre realities of 1955 but also with his own insecurities and the weight of legacy. The interactions between his teenage parents are both comedic and touching, showcasing how changes in the past can dramatically alter the future in ways both humorous and profound.*Back to the Future* is a tour de force, seamlessly merging practical effects with imaginative storytelling. The iconic DeLorean, with its signature ""flux capacitor,"" has become an emblem of adventure and possibility. The film's meticulous attention to detail in recreating the 1950s-from the music to the fashion-immerses viewers in a nostalgic trip that feels both authentic and fantastical.The clever screenplay, packed with quotable lines and memorable moments, pairs brilliantly with Alan Silvestri's unforgettable score, which echoes the film's themes of adventure and hope. From the exhilarating ride through the time barrier to the heartwarming finale, every scene serves to remind us that while we can't change the past, we hold the power to shape our future.*Back to the Future* is a timeless masterpiece that deserves its place in the pantheon of cinematic greats. It's a film that celebrates innovation, friendship, and the joys of growing up-encouraging us all to embrace our past while looking forward with optimism. So, grab your hoverboard and set your dial to 88 mph, because this journey into the heart of what makes us human is one you won't want to miss!"

05.07.2024,10.0,"I haven't watched this in years, but our family is watching movies this holiday and Back to the Future series is up.And it holds up. Or, rather, it holds up enough, because obviously someone editing the same movie in 2024 might make a few other choices.On the other hand, I see plenty that is superior to the fare we regularly get now.Of course, Michael J Fox is a favorite, but how fun to see the entire cast in ensemble and remember how talented each casting choice was.The music is just exceptional in this series, substantial but fun, lifting and carrying the chase sequences especially.It's funny to see product placement in a movie I think of as a box office hit and even legendary. However, the placements themselves almost add to the fun as we look at the 1980's looking at the 1950's from the vantages of the 2020's. (What a trip.)"
05.07.2024,9.0,"This is literally my reason for being fascinated by scifi movies. This movie is a gem and it deserves atleast a *9* from me. Out of all the Pros of the film, I may summarise them as :
1. Vfx is top notch for its time.2. After watching Alan Silvestri's name, you don't need to analyse more on the music stuff.3. Rhe plot is well written and well executed. No potholes, or bad/awkward moments.4. Screenplay was good.5. Even if the plot has extreme situations, good writing makes it better.This is, as far as I'm concerned, the best time travel movie I've witnessed.Lets appreciate it and give the makers what they deserve."

02.07.2024,10.0,"Why did they remove the half fence from all 3 of the movies, it added a different twist to the endings and kept everything in the correct court?I am now 73. Saw BTTF when it was first released. Instant classic, even if the so-called experts didn't see it at that time. Perfect foreshadowing. Perfect acting, not only by the major stars, but also by the bit players - Goldie Wilson, the clock tower lady, Lorraine's parents, Strickland, Dave and Linda, Marvin Berry, the Peabody family (you killed a pine!). Perfect dialogue with many repeatable and memorable lines or phrases - butthead, flux capacitor, what's a rerun?, who the hell is John F. Kennedy, give me a milk - chocolate, I'm your density, 1.21 giggawats, 88 miles per hour, we don't need roads, etc. Silvestri's score is one of the most recognizable in cinema history. When supplemented with Huey Lewis hits , and the Starlighter's songs, the music is also a perfect fit. Truly an iconic film which has, and will always remain one of the greatest feel good movies ever."

24.06.2024,10.0,"The Delorian is such a fun vehicle and I love the way they use it in this movie! Ten stars for sure. It reminds me of when I was a kid and when my father would quote the scenes from the movie. Michael did an amazing job as Marty McFly in Back to the Future. It will always remind me of the good old days when my pops says ""Roads, where we're going, we don't need roads."". And ""I finally invented something that works."" Haha. I would really like to see another version of this movie come out now! I hope that they come out with one eventually because it was absolutely amazing. 10/10. Anyways, great movie!"
23.06.2024,9.0,"Modern movie makers have so much to learn from this movie. After 15min everything is setup, we know all the characters, the later pay off is ready to go, and everything is well written, no dialogue is wasted and there are no modern sensitivity issues. And, although we do not know it watching this movie, the sequels are already setup too. Great filmmaking.The movie has great pace, a lot of things happen, but everything feels logical and to the point.A few negatives of course. Especially from a modern point of view. The computer graphics do not hold up, some of the time travel shenanigans does not work (since we know what happens in ""the future""). But perhaps the only real negative is how campy and basic everything feels. I also feel the sets are not always on point.From one of the best movie years of all time, 1985, this classic and mastery of filmmaking is of course to this day still very much watchable.A 9/10 and a must see for every lover of great cinema."
18.06.2024,7.0,"In the mid-1980s, screenwriters Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had a great idea. Wouldn't it be fun to make a film about a young guy who travels back in time and meets his own parents? When his folks are also teenagers, that is? Unfortunately, their enthusiasm was not shared by a single soul in Hollywood. No one wanted to invest money in such a whacky project. But then, when Zemeckis scored a hit with ""Romancing the Stone"" everything changed. Suddenly every studio in town wanted to do business with the two friends.Robert Zemeckis started shooting ""Back to the Future"" in November 1984. From the beginning, Eric Stoltz was supposed to have the lead role. But although Stoltz was an excellent actor, the director soon realized that he wasn't the right man for the part. So, Zemeckis turned instead to Michael J. Fox, star of the immensely popular sitcom ""Family Ties"". And luckily, Fox was keen to do the job. Even though it meant working on two gruelling projects at the same time.When Michael J. Fox sets off on his time-traveling trip, he uses a gleaming, modified DeLorean. However, that wasn't the case in Zemeckis and Gale's original script. The two authors had actually intended that the journey would start in a converted refrigerator (?) out in the hero's kitchen. Soon, however, the two scriptwriters realized that this could cause problems. Imagine if some kid was inspired by the movie and got trapped inside the family's fridge.Not surprisingly, ""Back to the Future"" became a smash hit, even surpassing ""Romancing the Stone"" at the box office. The film also made Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale the hottest scriptwriting team in Hollywood. In addition, John DeLorean sent a letter thanking the filmmakers for immortalizing his futuristic car. But the biggest proof of the movie's popularity was that Universal Pictures installed ""Back to the Future"" rides in their theme parks in California and Florida."
15.06.2024,8.0,"I saw this movie enough times I lost count. I don't want to watch ""Back to the Future"" ever again unless there is a version which has Elisabeth Shue in on it ;) I like the first movie a lot, but it isn't the best movie in the series. The best character in this movie is that little, dog Einstein who seem to have started this adventure in the first place :) I wanted to see more of this dog. The second best character in this movie is none other than Doc I reckon who still looks the same in 1985 :) And so does Mr Strickland :) I like George in this movie, but I wanted him to be a man. George was too much of a wimp! I did like the other characters especially Biff Tannen, the bully, but I wanted to see Biff's Grandma :) Even what the inside of his home looks like. You saw Biff's garage. I like manure also :) Back to the Future is an excellent movie. 9/10."
