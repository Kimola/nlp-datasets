15/01/2025,8,"This movie will change you, as some have commented. It will bring you to a disgusting low. Definitely skip it, or you'll be sorry you didn't.It's a sickening wretchingly vile voyueristic wannabe false glorification.Skip it. In fact be happy to skip it. Sometimes I think we have a big pile of juvenile retards on IMDb, that only hope to vote for any movie along the lines of it's inherent jerry springer qualities and the judgement comes as a message about how low and worthless it can get.This movie is not entertaining, it is not nice, it is not realistic, it is racist, degrading, and stupid.Don't waste your money, your time, or your life."
27/12/2024,8,Pulp Fiction is an amazing movie filled with great dialogue and violence. Highly recommend watching it no matter what genre you like. One of the best Tarantino films ever. Go watch it
07/12/2024,8,"Pulp fiction, the magnum opus of Quentin Tarantino, is an absolute visual treat. The exemplary usage of nonlinear story-telling will leave the viewers open mouthed. Backed up by some very powerful performances by the cast, the film has become a benchmark for all black comedy films.The screenplay by Tarantino artistically narrates the incidents concerning a particularly interesting group of people. The film is replete with iconic moments, like the monologue perfectly delivered by Jules Winnfield (Samuel Jackson), the twist dance routine of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and the Mexican standoff in a diner. However, this masterpiece is not recommended for the faint- hearted, as a lot of R - rated violent scenes of great detail are interspersed in the film.The soundtrack has been compiled quite tastefully. 'Misirlou' sets a funky tone for the film during the opening credits. Structurally, the film is divided into seven sequences, which have connected stories. As expected, the cameo from Tarantino himself as Jimmie, the distraught husband in arguably the most entertaining part of the film - The Bonnie situation - proves to be the cherry on the cake."
18/11/2024,10,"The movie that shot director Quentin Tarantino into popularity, pulp fiction still stands as his greatest movie and one of the best movies ever created.The film follows multiple inter-connecting plot lines: Samuel L Jackson and John Trovolta play two hit men searching for a stolen briefcase, Uma Thurman plays the boss mans wife out on a date with Trovolta, Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run from gangsters, ands Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple robbing a diner. The plot is structured brilliantly and is told out of order which makes things even more interesting.The film features most Tarantino trademarks, including his normal chunky dialogue, with some of the most quotable lines in any film ever contained here. The films also not shy on action and there's loads of surprises throughout the movie(although I wont spoil anything).Acting wise, pulp fiction features one of the greatest casts in film history. Jackson gives what is undoubtedly the best performance of his career as the bible spouting hit man, while Trovolta gives another great performance in the role that resurrected his career. Thurman also acts brilliantly as the sexy but mysterious wife to the main mafia boss. The supporting cast is strong with Harvey Keitel playing the gangster expert and even Tarantino himself has a small but hilarious role.But thats not the only reason PF is so great, its everything about it. The soundtrack is classic Tarantino with tons of pop culture tunes used to add to the story. While the camera work is some of the best since the films release. And the film just keeps on giving, from its smart opening scene which carries the whole movie, to its hilarious middle acts, to its hugely satisfying conclusion.As it stands, pulp fiction is still one of the funniest, darkest, most enjoyable and most creative films ever. If you haven't seen the film yet then I can't recommend enough you go out and watch it as soon as you can. A true classic."
29/10/2024,10,"When I watched pulp fiction for the first time I didn't like it since I didn't know what to expect
and I entirely focused only on the story-line but after a repeated view I just fell in love with this movie I ain't got mich to say about this film since everyone said about its originality,non linear story yelling and its masterful screenplay.All I can say is the movie is worth the love and the appreciation it got and it is one of the best movies ever made."
17/10/2024,10,"absolutely fantastic music, and directorial genius, anyone who thinks otherwise obviously did not understand it. Witty dialogue and intelligent storyline and definet for true movie lovers, fantastic script with impeccable timing and well acted, a truly incredible movie. an unpredictable storyline that will take the viewer by surprise, a twisted and juggled plot to leave you thinking about the movie. watching this movie will leave you wanting more of tarentino's writing and directorial work, ( see reservoir dogs, kill bill etc). this movie will make you think and is not for the faint hearted and does not involve any seedy special effect to draw attention away from this impeccably written story and nothing else to say except this movie deserves full marks in every category"
01/10/2024,10,This film is simply pure Art. Something to just watch and indulge in. It's one of those art pieces that never get boring. Tarantino refuses to show any flaws in this film. Cinema at it's peak.
30/09/2024,10,"Hands down some of the best acting and directing in this film! I love how it all came together, the editing matched the theme and some times made you confused about what was going on."
24/08/2024,7,"In a diner, a man and a woman who call each other Pumpkin and Honey Bunny eat breakfast in a booth. Honey Bunny teases Pumpkin for not wanting to commit armed robberies anymore, and Pumpkin explains that robbing the diner would be better than robbing convenience stores or banks. She agrees, and the two leap to their feet and draw their weapons, before the opening credits roll.Across town, two men in suits named Vincent and Jules ride in a car discussing Europe and fast food. Jules tells Vincent that Marsellus, their boss, allegedly had a man thrown off a balcony for massaging his wife Mia's feet, who Vincent has been instructed to take out to dinner. They argue about the implications of foot massages, before storming an apartment with three men inside. Jules kills one, and recites Ezekiel 25:17 before killing another, named Brett. Vincent retrieves a briefcase, the contents of which glow, from a kitchen cabinet.In a bar, Marsellus gives an envelope full of cash to a boxer named Butch, bribing him to throw his next match. Vincent and Jules, now wearing tee shirts, enter the bar, and Butch has a brief exchange with Vincent on his way out.
In the following scene, Vincent buys heroin from his drug dealer, named Lance, and talks briefly to his girlfriend Jody. After buying three grams of heroin, Vincent shoots up and heads to Mia's house. Mia does cocaine in the bathroom while Vincent fixes himself a drink. They head to a restaurant named Jackrabbit Slim's, where they talk about Mia's failed television pilot and the foot massage rumor, which Mia denies. Mia forces Vincent to participate in a twist contest, which they win.Back at Mia's house, while Vincent uses the bathroom, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine and snorts it, falling unconscious. A panicked Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, although Lance is reluctant to help. Vincent is able to successfully revive her with an adrenaline shot straight to the heart. At the end of the night, Mia tells Vincent a joke from her television pilot, which she previously refused to divulge, and the two agree to keep the night's events a secret.A man named Captain Koons visits Butch as a child, giving him a gold watch that is a family heirloom. As an adult, Butch kills his opponent in a boxing match, rather than purposely lose as Marsellus wanted. Butch escapes in a cab driven by a woman named Esmeralda, and calls a bookie named Scottie who plans to collect Butch's earnings. Meanwhile, Marsellus orders that Butch be killed. At a nearby motel, Butch's girlfriend Fabienne waits for him, and the two talk and have sex. The next morning, Butch realizes his gold watch is missing, and angrily leaves the motel in search of it.Butch cautiously returns to his apartment, and initially finds no one there. He retrieves the watch and notices a gun on the counter. He hears the toilet flush, and kills the man who emerges from the bathroom, which turns out to be Vincent. Butch leaves and is spotted by Marsellus at a stoplight. Butch rams him with his car, and an injured Marsellus chases an injured Butch until both men are subdued inside a nearby pawn shop by the owner, named Maynard.Butch and Marsellus awaken in the pawn shop basement, where Maynard has bound and gagged them. A man named Zed shows up, who orders Maynard to get ""the Gimp,"" a man in a full-body bondage suit who sleeps in a trunk. Zed drags Marsellus into another room to be raped while Maynard watches, and Butch manages to break free. Butch is about to flee when he hears Marsellus's cries and instead retrieves a katana sword and ambushes the men, killing Maynard. Now freed, Marsellus shoots Zed in the crotch, and tells Butch that the men are even, as long as Butch leaves town and never tells anyone about the incident. Butch rides Zed's chopper motorcycle back to the motel, and he and Fabienne ride away together.The film flashes back to the scene where Jules recites Ezekiel 25:17, this time from the perspective of an armed man hiding in the bathroom. After Jules kills Brett, the man runs out and fires wildly, miraculously missing Jules and Vincent with his entire clip. Jules and Vincent kill him, and Jules calls the event an act of ""divine intervention."" The two take Marvin, the only surviving man in the apartment, with them, and leave. In the car, the men continue debating ""divine intervention,"" and Jules pledges to give up his life of crime. Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, killing him. Jules calls a nearby friend named Jimmie, and they head to his house to deal with the cleanup.
At Jimmie's house, Jules calls Marsellus for help, who arranges for a man named Winston Wolfe to come over and help fix the situation. Jimmie tells the men they have ninety minutes before his wife Bonnie arrives home. Wolfe arrives ten minutes later and instructs Jules and Vincent to wipe down the car upholstery. They place Jimmie's blankets over the seat, and Wolfe hoses a naked Jules and Vincent down in the backyard, before giving them old tee shirts to wear. They follow Wolfe to a nearby auto shop, where the car is destroyed. Wolfe introduces Jules and Vincent to his girlfriend Raquel on his way out of the auto shop, and then leaves.Jules and Vincent decide to get breakfast at the same diner that Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are about to rob in the first scene. Vincent goes to the bathroom just before Pumpkin and Honey Bunny draw their guns. When Pumpkin demands Jules's wallet and the briefcase, Jules draws his weapon, and explains to Pumpkin that he now understands the true meaning of Ezekiel 25:17, and wants to find a non-violent solution. Vincent emerges from the bathroom, resulting in a Mexican standoff. Jules successfully de-escalates the situation, and he and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand."
07/08/2024,7,"Every movie has at least one person who doesn't like it just as every great movie has at least 1 person who does not enjoy the film, this film not the exception that proves the rule but rather a text book example.  Warning: not everyone will love this movie.  That aside, the rest of you will hold this movie next to such timeless classics as The Godfather Part I and The Usual Suspects, this isn't a ""One-hit Wonder,"" Quentin Tarantino has proven himself perhaps as the best director of our time, second to Francis Ford Coppola, maybe.  No, Pulp Fiction is a movie that doesn't rely on special effects or hype to sell as does many movies such as Lord of The Rings. This movie is real.  The monolog delivered by John Travolta in Swordfish applies to this movie: no moronic sentences, no bad acting, and a story seemingly flawless.  Yes this movie deserves to be compared to The Godfather Part I, and buy the DVD."
02/07/2024,9,"I thought it was a good movie though there's a lot of violence and drugs,but it doesn't wants to influence us to do drugs or killed people. I think its a moral that teaches us to prevent people,especially teens not to do drugs or be violent because of the consequences which in the movie we can realized what has happened."
23/06/2024,9,"I think Pulp Fiction is really misunderstood. Many friends don't like the movie, because they think it's too difficult. Pulp Fiction is one of Tarantino's best, but I still think Reservoir Dogs is a much better movie. But what I do like, is the fact that Tarantino always uses the same actors. They're all great! Think about it: Harvey Keitel (who played mr. White in Reservoir Dogs) , Uma Thurman (Batman & Robin), Ving Rhames (Mission:Impossible), Tim Roth (also Reservoir Dogs) ,... I just think it's fantastic! Go on and make many other movies like that, Quentin!!!"
16/06/2024,9,"Incredible film which I love in so many ways. From the quirky way several seemingly disjointed stories come together, the sarcastic humor, the gratuitous (but delectable) violence, and even the soundtrack. Samuel L. Jackson & Bruce Willis are both brilliant in a film which is more than just a must watch, but a most watch over and over addition to any film collection. 10 of 10!"
14/06/2024,9,"""Pulp Fiction"" panders to base behavior.The filth of the language,subject matter,including sodomy,sickening drug use & the flippancy of the hit men is not amusing.This movie is one of the worst pieces of trash ever pawned off as art!Glorification of this movie illuminates the level of moral turpitude that permeates throughout American society & Hollywood in particular."
12/06/2024,9,"It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments."
20/05/2024,4,"Pulp Fiction (1994) **** (out of 4) Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the ""real"" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that ""Bad Motherf&*&er,"" which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age."
29/04/2024,5,"Pulp Fiction rules. It is one of the pinnacles of cinema. But for all the people who like to spoil the fun by asking the question why, here's why: excellent performances (especially Samuel L. Jackson & John Travolta as a pair of hit men), fun characters and possibly the greatest screenplay of all time. For anyone who hasn't seen Pulp Fiction, watch it. For those who have seen it, watch it again and revisit Butch, Jules, Vincent, Mia, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. Thank you, Quentin.Relive one of the greatest films of all time 10/10. Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Frequent Language, Strong Drug Use and Some Very Disturbing Sexual Content."
15/04/2024,4,"This is independent film-making at its finest, with the best ensemble cast to have possibly ever graced the silver screen.  Tarantino will never equal this.  Jackie Brown, being a pretty good flick seemed totally crap having been Tarantino's long awaited return after this jem.  Samuel Jackson plays his best role to a tee here.  A clear 10/10"
07/03/2024,4,Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) robs a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are thugs working for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the Wolf (Harvey Keitel). Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).This is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. It has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s.
04/03/2024,4,"PULP FICTION is a singular show. The best way to describe it is that it is as if you sit down in the living room with the television and are immediately transported to a roller coaster going full speed through a fun house of ghoulish images. This is complemented with one of the funniest, smartest, and filthiest dialogs I have heard in a long time. There is no other movie I can compare it to. It has the adrenaline flow of SPEED, the intelligent dialog of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, the violence of the goriest part of the GODFATHER, and the comedy of AUSTIN POWERS. All that having been said, it is like none of the above other than the superficial aspects I just mentioned.If extreme violence (e.g., brains blown on car windows) is something you can not endure, if 700 uses of the F word is something you can not tolerate, if heavy drug use is something you care never to see (cocaine is passe we learn, all of the in-gangsters now do heroin), then do not pay your money to see PULP FICTION.On the other hand, all of the above really works in this show. This is a parody of criminal life and a really funny one. This is a show that takes one chance after another. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are nothing short of terrific in it. Oscars are possible here. They play the hit men for a major bad guy (Marsellus Wallace). The bad guy is also paying a boxer (Bruce Willis) to take a dive. Harvey Keitel plays a fixer of problems for the bad guy. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple of two-bit crooks who like robbing restaurants because nobody else does that. Eric Stoltz plays a low class drug dealer and Rosanna Arquette plays his girlfriend who has rings in every part of her anatomy (yes, there too). Christopher Walken shows up in a single long important scene. Uma Thurman plays the major bad guy's wife. Whew, and I probably missed a lot of other people who did some great acting.The major hero and the one who took the most risks in this movie was the scriptwriter. He was also the director - Quentin Tarantino. The script went from funny scenes like a restaurant where all the staff were 50s famous look-alikes to a scene where the two hit men were first discussing what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in France and why to a discussion of whether it was okay to kill someone for massaging your wife's feet.This is a movie that to describe it will only make you want NOT to go see it, yet it is mesmerizing and wonderful. The intensity level of the movie is off the scale. People were laughing like crazy in the theater and to intelligent dialog too. Other scenes had the audience gasping for breath and uttering out loud ""oh, my god"". Several scenes were worse than the finger cutting scene in The Piano.The camerawork was mainly standard stuff, but there are several scenes where it got pretty experimental. The best example is the long scene of Wills staring into the camera without moving while he listens to the major bad guy, whom we have not yet seen, delivering a long lecture. It then switches to a view of only the back of the bad guy's head with everything else out of focus while Willis listens for quite a while more."
02/03/2024,3,"Every time I watch this movie, I get reminded why they call Quentin Tarantino a master of dialogue. It is a shockingly smart and original movie all the way through. Every actor does a tremendous job at delivering quotable yet realistic lines. It is very tough to decide which scene is the best. The burger scene? The ending scene? The overdose? The escape from the rapists? I guess I will never know which one I prefer, and that, is what makes this film truly iconic."
13/02/2024,8,I'm not going to say anything new here. Not my favorite Tarantino movie but hard to argue that it didn't do a lot to change cinema. And it gave us Sam Jackson. Must see classic.
10/02/2024,8,"I love this film so much. Way back then i'd only see Pulp Fiction memes and mimic figuratively portrayed. Poor being from a third world country, it's truly hard to participate festive on the industry of all kind, specifically film. So when i first saw this film, i really had no idea this is 'it'. This is perfect metaphor of Pandora box for mine. Got me so woke as hell.The aesthetic grain of Pulp Fiction fixated why i should differentiate what is really my liking and what is shoved into my throat. And watching it in 2016 where it's the era of minorities be winning, old racist joke is still kicking right. While i don't mind some spoilers here and there, this is the first time as long as i can remember, i'm watching without no expectation."
10/02/2024,8,"It was a day like any other. Wake up early morning, eat, school, jack off etc. etc. etc. I would come back home from school, shower, eat then try and find ways to waste time. I would flip through channels like a magazine, or probably treat myself to a snack. The thing that made this day special, was that I was going to watch (IMO) the greatest movie of all time. Before watching this movie, my taste was.... Generic, to say the least. My favorite movie was The A-Team. My taste was horrible. I recently watched Inception, so I was slowly being... Devoured or welcomed (whichever way you see it) into the movie world. After watching THIS piece of art, however, I was just amazed. The acting was amazing. The directing was pitch perfect. And the script... Oh jumping Jesus on a pogo stick, the script left me speechless. I envy those movie watchers who get to watch this for the first time. Anyways, fast forward a couple of months later, i already watched; Casablanca, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Raging Bull, The Godfather, Reservoir Dogs, Schindler's List, TGTBTU, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, L.A Confidential, Apocalypse Now, Fight Club and so on and so forth. I would recommend this or The Godfather for any person that wants to 'get IN' movies. Since both are classics and impossible to dislike.11/10"
10/02/2024,8,"Wow. Amazed. Shocked. Shaken. Scarred for life (in a good way). But seriously it’s hard to find words to describe a near flawless work of art. You will either love it or hate it. But you will have to watch it regardless of what everyone else says. Pulp fiction is truly fiction …and Quentin Tarantino (one of my favorite directors) has crafted this masterpiece to bring a bit of everything into it. There was no movie and there won’t be any movie that can be made in the same fashion as Pulp Fiction. It sets a class of its own. It is undoubtedly ‘one in a million’. The acting is superb, the screenplay unmatched, the script engaging and the direction could not be any better. Violent and real, it brings life onto the screen in the first five minutes. This is one movie I would see in the theatre again – if were re-released that is. But *sigh* we have to get used to the DVDs now."
24/01/2024,8,"Pulp Fiction is a crazy,wild ride of a movie and is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. It effectively combines smart original dialogue, wildly entertaining plot lines and many memorable characters. This movie is Quentin Tarantino at top form,delivering what is his greatest film to date,and one of the best films ever made. I will say that I am not quite sure it deserves the number 5 spot on the IMDb top 250 list,not because I don't like it but simply because I think that there are better movies out there. But to get back on the subject this is an amazing film. It is stunning in its brilliance and a joy to watch. It can also effectively switch moods at the drop of a hat. Sometimes it plays like a buddy comedy,other times it is dark and extremely suspenseful.I will say that the only complaint I could ever see thrown at this movie is lack of emotional involvement or feeling. I get this way with most of Tarantino's work but with this film I really didn't care. It is just sheer brilliance,imaginative film making and excellent entertainment. An absolute must see"
23/01/2024,8,"This movie has a legendary reputation. But I don't see why. It was smart,witty,charming in it's own way,and a fun movie,but it's not a work of genius. The constant jumping back and forth in time is really confusing. I've watched this movie I know at least 10 times,and still can not figure out what takes place when. And WHAT is in that briefcase? Someone once said it was someone's soul. Which raises a bunch of other questions. I see this as an ok movie,but incredibly over-hyped,and I think way too much has been read into it."
22/01/2024,8,"How do you review this? Like how do you actually review this masterpiece. It's actual pop culture now, like yes I have the poster (framed) and I have Jules on a t shirt, who doesn't? Now, I've not been making the Pulp Fiction loving part of me explicit lately because it's been pissing me off how people watch it and then act like they know everything about movies. I mean.... I was that person 3/4 years ago I really thought I knew it all watching this so yeah I get it amateur cinephiles but I still don't support it. Oh and it isn't my favourite Tarantino oh no that spot's deserves for Inglorious Basterds but this I second. I've been debating on this or Once Upon a Time In Hollywood for a while but the pure classic genius of this just had to take spot number 2. I mean I shall now and attempt to actually analyse the brilliance of this movie now that I've got the subtext out of the way. Structure-wise, writing-wise, soundtrack-wise, character-wise, action-wise and slickness-wise it gets all fucking right. All of these things just make a perfectly peculiar yet divinely beautiful amalgamation that crates the most unique vibe. The main thing with Pulp Fiction is vibe and how it makes you feel. It's not uplifting but it makes you smile, it's the prime example of style and substance. But I couldn't really describe the substance part to you because I mean I wasn't in my feels but I was invested, I was so invested in every single one of these characters even if they were dicks and even if they were only on screen for one screen. I think this is because Tarantino is brilliant at showing you real people, I mean they're in extreme and probably unrealistic situations but they're real people who talk about real things and that sits with you. I mean it's all definitely been said before but hey my opinion still matters, right?"
14/01/2024,8,"Quentin Tarantino's second film contains a confusing storyline, lack of in-depth plot, no obvious message, and a seemingly never ending amount of dialogue.....and it works. Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary film that has been applauded by critics and fans alike. The films non-linear storyline contains the stories of a couple who robs diners, two hit men who do a job for their crime boss, and a boxer past his prime who is asked to take a dive.The cast does a fantastic acting job that varies from Bruce Willis' street smart Butch to Uma Thurman's Mia who has a taste for nose candy. The two actors who shine in the movie is the duo of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Travolta's character goes through a variety of emotions throughout the film such as his laid-back side while riding in the car with Jackson, to the intensity in his face while saving Uma Thurman's character from an overdose. Jackson's character has a ferocity to him that makes the character very memorable.The camera work by Tarantino is wonderfully done with shots that include his trademark trunk shot and Mexican standoff. Also, there is a well put together soundtrack to the film. The masterful film making and acting in Pulp Fiction makes it my favorite film of all time."
19/12/2023,7,"One of the Best movies i've ever seen,it is the best work of Tarantino. Interlocking different stories into one with black humor, action and thriller are some greatest qualities of this awesome movie. The acting is dynamite: John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis gave very good performance. You will find humor, action, thriller, suspense and new sense of continuum in this movie."
04/12/2023,8,"The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. The non-linear and looping time order of the scenes smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. The movie is like several episodes of a TV show thrown together.Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. The actors are doing a fine job with the crap they are given. However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema!"
28/11/2023,10,"Amazing.I watched every second of this movie and was not bored at all. It had fabulous acting performances from Travolta and Jackson, good supporting cast like Thurman and Willis, the slick dialogues, natural realistic suspense, groovy soundtracks and a series of long camera shots. This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made. Standout performance was Samuel L.Jackson with his cool gangster charm and quick wit. This movie deserved the Oscar for best picture and never got it. Very sad. Jackson also deserved an Oscar. But again didn't get it. It was amazing that how entertaining the dialogue was. Even when there was no words, natural silence was just as addictiveA very much deserved 10/10."
20/11/2023,10,"It may have a clue to whats in the case.........I've had many an argument over what's in the case. The fact is no one really knows and no matter how many times you watch it and thing you know other thing throw it in a different direction.
My theory is it is either: Marcellus Wallace's soul . Clues being the plaster, Jules' bible references and his determination to protect the case, the 666 combination amongst others.OR It may be Butch's boxing belt. again references crop up to make you think that it is this. OR it may just be a clever stunt to get people thinking more of an already great film!"
04/11/2023,10,"This movie brings a new exploration of dialogue that I've never seen, and it's brilliantly constructed with some intense scenes. Samuel L Jackson is literally Samuel L Jackson in this movie. Pretty cool movie overall."
30/09/2023,10,"As an actor myself this should be a staple or requirement to watch for any acting class. As printed out in the great book THE POWER OF THE ACTOR by Ivana Chubbuck you see all of her steps, but to me you see the second step SCENE OBJECTIVE used amazingly in this film. Within each scene you really see how the actors work off of each other to achieve the goal of each scene. The opening scene set the tone for the rest of the film, and every actor in it no matter how big of a role the play absolutely kills their role. Fantastic movie from start to finish... do yourself a favor and I would be shocked if you haven't seen it but go watch it ASAP!!!"
18/09/2023,10,"There aren't many films that are as iconic as pulp fiction, everthing is so masterfully done from the witty and genius writing to the catchy and fitting music, this truly is a masterpiece for the agesThe story is somehow even better than everything else, its mesmerising to say the least, the heartbreaking and thrilling story is so powerful to anybody watching, but it's also hilarious, there aren't many films that can be a comedy and action and love story at the same time and execute it so beautifullyAlthough I don't belive this is tarantos best work, I understand that that's quite controversial but it's true, it's certainly up there and there's nothing inherently wrong with this at all it's just some of his filmography slightly take an edgeOverall I'd say this film is a must watch for anybody who just wants an amazing time."
11/09/2023,10,"Movie that within next 100 years won't be forgotten. Pure pulp classic, visionary fiction of a time. Tarantino is unique director. He had some kind of luck to break into Hollywood straight out of video store and I don't think it's possible in the modern days.Rare thing about Pulp Fiction is that.., what's the movie about? It's hard to say, nevertheless it works which is basically impossible scheme for any other movie. It just works.So overall, great writing, acting, soundtrack etc., this is one of the favorite movies and if you somehow didn't see it, stop whatever you're doing right now and watch it immediately.10 out of 10 not because it's ten, there are no real tens. Just there are movies that stand aside and above."
08/08/2023,7,"I am not a huge fan of Tarantino, but I love Pulp Fiction. It is so unique and weird and it's so fun to watch. It's the type of movie that you feel compelled to watch again because you think you missed something. Although there are multiple character plots going on at once, it all feels very streamlined and easy to follow. One of my favorites."
05/08/2023,7,"This movie has been debated and analyzed and dissected for years. I could make a lot of detailed arguments for why I think it works so well. But the simple truth is that when I saw this movie for the first time, on opening day of its original release, I had one of the best times I've ever had watching a movie. And it's one of those films that I could rewatch again and again. It's a masterpiece."
02/08/2023,6,"I never really like when a movie gets labeled a ""defining chapter"" of movie making or gets named a classic just cause it's different. Sometimes it is sometimes it's not. Clockwork orange is one of those which i felt was garbage as a movie. Pulp fiction is another. Sure, it has speed, weird characters and slick lines and stories all over the place. For me weird isn't always good as there is no red line, no real story to follow. I don't even find this movie very cool even though it might be worth a watch just cause it's like no other movie. But the story, the substance of the movie is very thin. Tarantino is for me not a very good director. Sure, some of his movies are OK, but mostly he overdo it on many occasions, which makes it hard to takes them seriously. It's no real drama, no action, no thriller, just something put in a blender it seems. If u want a true story, a movie with substance and an experience richer after wards, this is not a movie to get anywhere near."
22/07/2023,9,A very original story that could only be thought up by Tarantino. This is the film that put John Travolta back on the map and Samuel L. Jackson is also terrific in his role. Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career and Uma Thurman probably gives the best performance of hers. The cinematography is excellent and Tarantino really established himself as one of America's best directors with this film. A terrific movie that can be watched many times!My rating : @@@@ (out of five)
17/07/2023,9,"If you haven't seen this, you've been living on the outskirts of society with no TV for 30 years. It's a quintessential film to watch. They don't make movies as good as this anymore. Cinematography,screenwriting,dialogue, cannot be beat."
10/07/2023,9,"Boring. Rubbish Film as per most of Tarantino's stuff. The only good film Tarantino ever directed was the first half of 'Dusk till Dawn'. 'True Romance' was good as well,though he didn't direct it. It was also let down somewhat by Tarantino's poor dialogue (see Patricia Arquette's speech where she reveals she's a call girl. Appalling dialogue. Very Tarantino.) I recommend you spend you time better by watching all the films he's paid homage to (ripped off) such as 'Vanishing Point', 'Death rides a horse', 'the Baby Cart series', The original 'Inglorious Bastards' etc Tarantino and his rehashing of films which have passed out of the collective conscious is pretty unpleasant and not clever. The whole point of taking influence from other people's work is to then create something of your own which is greater than the sum of its part. This Tarantino fails to do repeatedly."
06/07/2023,9,The movie is as bad. If Aleksandr Nevsky directed it it would be very very wonderful. YOur Tarantino is no talent he is in a shadow of Aleksandr Nevsky. His movies are not badass nor funny. Aleksnadr Nevsky's movies are actiony good sotry and good jokes. the movie has not script it was directed on the go. Tarantino no scirpt means bad business. I thought the movie is gonna be as beautiful as Treasure Hunters by Aleksandr Nevksy but it is no. No no no just very really no. Avoid your spending time of life on this garbage go and watch Aleksandr Nevsky's movies. They are very underrated. Pulp fiction is overrated because Tarantino is no Aleksandr NEvsky. I know good you know bad.
25/06/2023,9,"one of the best movies ever made. I have been watching it every week since it was made, kind of obsessed with this one. This movie blows your mind totally and keeps you enchanted from the opening shot till the ending shot. A lot has been said about it already so i don't want to spoil the fun. All i want to say is that if you like movies and have not seen this one, you are a loser. I am not sure what to call the best about this flick. The plot, the shots, the music, the performances , it is overwhelming.its never too late, watch it now. It is close to ""the perfect movie"" ever made."
16/06/2023,9,"First up: I haven't seen all of Tarantino's work, so comparison with other movies directed by him will be nowhere to be seen in this comment. Secondly, I've recently seen Pulp Fiction for probably the third or fourth time, which is (for me) the necessary amount of times needed to fully be able to value it correctly.Harvey Keitel as the Wolf, Ving Rhames as Mr Wallace, Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, they all make a great cast. Not only the acting in itself is great, but also the chemistry between the characters and their surroundings and situations simply works and works very well. Simply put: they (the actors) couldn't have done a better job.The storyline is split up in bits and pieces and come together in the end like a bit of tape being stitched together. The pace is never slow, even when there are long dialogues: the dialogues actually make the movie go up a level! Lots of stuff going on: drugs, crime, death, coincidence, religious stuff, sex, and so on. This movie is definitely not for the faint hearted.In terms of the music and cinematography, this is the next bonus: an excellent soundtrack being put to good use during the various 'move on' scenes or to get a certain atmosphere during a scene. It's not just loose bits, it's all a fast food package: heavy on the tummy but tasty to eat.All in all a great movie, and yes, the first (and so far I believe the only one) that gets a 10 out of 10 from me here on IMDb. Must see. Definitely."
12/06/2023,9,"After almost three hours of watching Pulp Fiction, I can fairly say I did not want the movie to end. So just to give you a quick summary without giving out spoilers: Pulp Fiction is just about entertaining its viewers! This is what all movies should be, if you also consider Tarantinos opinion and this is all what Pulp Fiction is about: Great dialogs, cool scenes, awesome characters, phenomenal camera positioning, some of the best music and so on.It is something different here, you can do the same stuff in other movies, but it works so good in Pulp Fiction that you can not think of other ways to make the movie. Even the slightest scene taken out, would make this masterpiece incomplete.What about the cast? Could you consider other actors to take part in this movie? Tarantino gave Travolta another starting role for Hollywood, who was at the bottom of his success. What is the awesome QT doing, he is giving him a drug addict role and also lets him dance. This is what Jon Travolta is best at and this is what the audience wants to see. We do not want him see doing psychopaths, let him dance! What is Samuel L Jackson doing? Saying Motherf****er or cursing in English. That is what we want to see, we want to see a philosophical, aggressive black man. The audience loves it. Also Uma Thurman could not play a cooler role in Pulp Fiction, some fan theories even say her role in the ninja squad was actually The Bride from Kill Bill.To sum it up, watch it. If you do not like it, watch it till you love it."
11/06/2023,9,"The first time I watched this movie I was all of 13 or so, so it was difficult to appreciate.  Now, over time, it is a perfectly crafted entity, each scene a masterpiece.  Everyone knows when to arrive, what to say, how to squirm, and when to leave.  Flawless.  Quentin Tarantino is a genius, but Samuel L. Jackson is The Man, for now and forever."
09/06/2023,9,"This film had it's moments, and contained interesting scenes, but I just can't get behind a movie when I couldn't care less which characters live or die. You really have to look hard to find redeeming qualities in any of them. Bruce Willis' character was really the only one I cared even a little about."
05/06/2023,9,"As Tarantino states, its not confusing. You have to watch it but thats all he asks. And if you do you'll become embroiled with the most self reflexive film around. Cluttered with inter textual references to pop culture e.g pilots,Marilyn Monroe,Fonzie etc Tarantinos sublimely definitive post modern film highlights its artifice and as such we are suckered in.While the prudish may squirm at a 'immature celebration of violence' I personally applaud the profound approach of Tarantino presenting us with such outlandishly gruesome violence (pieces of brain etc) that we can do nothing but laugh. And for that reason. It's not realism. Nor does it try to be. On the contrary the surreal is celebrated here. You need only watch the scene involving Butch's selection of weapons in a standard corner store (a hammer, a chainsaw, a samurai sword) to realise Tarantino's playful homage to some of his favourite genres isn't halted by a reductive realist approach.While the narrative is a little disorientating on times, the beauty of it is that the audience become involved in the film more-so; it's their task to piece everything together. An interactive movie if you will. Tarantino being a film buff clutters his film with homage to some of his favourites. The dancing sequence involving Travolta evokes such nostalgia among movie fans for his roles in Greace and Saturday Night Fever, though is originally a nod to Jean Luc Godard for his approach of just stopping the film in full flow for a musical sequence. The briefcase with the light inside echos that of Kiss Me Deadly; a classical noir while Walkens tale regarding the watch mirrors the character from The Deer Hunter who was captured in Vietnam.On to performance. Travolta an unlikely choice at the time people forget does wonderfully well as our on screen stand in. He's constantly behind what's happening (the motif of events changing dramatically with every visit Vincent makes to the toilet is one often mentioned)and plays catch up alongside us since the narrative is so ridiculously spontaneous spinning off in unexpected directions(who on earth would have seen a rape scene ensue from Butch and Marcellus storyline, or Mias unexpected O.D- that wasn't on the cards was it). Jackson is the man as always playing Mr Cool here perfectly and Willis already a household name by this point brings credibility to the film, all the same his segment of the film is my least favourite. Possibly because of the playful immature banter between the two supposedly professional hit-man is just too funny. I just love the fact that in Tarantinos world, two dangerous murderers are brought down to bickering school children, scared to death of the thought of Jimmys wife arriving home. Not of the police, but of Jimmys wife. Surreal, but thats the beauty of this film. Simply has to be watched. One of the best films you'll see. I love Inglorious Basterds but i cant decide whether it tops Pulp Fiction. Either way both are amazing. Watch this film."
31/05/2023,3,"I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do."
27/05/2023,3,"Color me stupid but I thought ""Pulp Fiction"" sucked. Being creative is easy when there are no rules...as in fantasies and cartoons and, well, pulp fiction. Creativity is not easy when the rules of reality are imposed. The reason why it took me several sessions over several  years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, ""Pulp..."" -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting. Why no T&A???"
26/05/2023,3,"Ill go on record and claim that Pulp Fiction is probably the best motion picture Ive ever seen. After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not. Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry. Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible. Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good. If you havent seen this, rent it, watch it and enjoy it. Its one hell of a ride.***** out of ******"
23/05/2023,3,"Inspired by true events, a true story, masterful, twisted and bent Quentin Tarantino with a crowd of brilliant talent that destroys essential life to promote egotistic nepotism; in short stunning and sensational. Pulp Fiction has a timeless addiction that pervades the veins and makes the heartbeat faster... Why 9? Whine and wine again... there's something special about being inglorious... and years later Quentin is still pumping the fiction and mashing the pulp. This film has insights looking both backward and forward ... a reel show of American ideology that alludes to foreign infiltration of the system. How can one not love Pulp Fiction? From one of America's most controversial film directors who does not shy away or shudder in fear, a man who tackles complex thematic material head on, in overt gritty chains... and has managed to unchain the bleeding heart flicker by flicker."
21/05/2023,3,"Pulp Fiction doesn't have a plot. Or, it doesn't have a linear and evolving plot. Instead, it is just a collection of relatively unrelated stories that include some of the same characters. However, what makes this crime movie special is these stories aren't about the dangerous life and business of a gangster, but instead about just the day to day life of people who happen to be employed by the mob. Now, at first this may seem boring and pointless, but after a closer look, you'll realize that there is one thing about these stories that stands out. The dialogue. Every conversation is unrealistically realistic. People will go on long debates and monologues about everything from french burgers, the metric system, foot massages, tasty burgers, refreshing beverages, why some guy got thrown out of a window because of a foot massage, divine intervention, good coffee, comfortable silences, and just walking the Earth. Every conversation seems like an exaggeration of a conversation you might have. This is only made better by the intermittent action and violence that occurs, which only adds to the complete absurdity that makes this movie so great.Pulp Fiction is one of funniest, most interesting, and most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. 100/100. An absolutely necessary watch."
14/05/2023,3,"I can certainly respect this movie. As a form of art it is fantastically unique and masterfully eclectic. It is the epitome of a postmodern film - with no conventional story structure, no central conflict, no clear moral, achronological 'storytelling', and so on. It definitely needs to be appreciated for its incredible style.But as with most postmodernist art, tossing aside everything that makes traditional art good sure stands out as bold and unique, but it comes with its negatives. And unlike most reviewers I don't think being 'unique' is a sufficient substitute for being devoid of the traditional things that make a film good.For instance, this movie does not have great pacing. Partially a result of the lack of (conventional) plot development and story structure, but also partially a result of the often (deliberately) mundane dialogue. I realize postmodern art can often be very self-referential, but I personally can't see why a lot of this dialogue had to exist. It doesnt immerse you, it doesnt engage you, or advance the plot... its usually not even funny. So whats the point?But what is the point in general? Pulp fiction meanders around without really giving any core messages. Perhaps right at the end in the epilogue scene, it says something meaningful and ties at least some of the themes together quite well. And masterful as Tarantino is, the scene is just ambiguous enough to keep people talking about what exactly it means.So yes, this is a great movie to analyze and critique, but its missing too many ingredients that make a story great to experience."
11/05/2023,3,"Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and really a unique film by classic Quentin Tarantino. Quentin Tarantino is one of the best director and his all movie kept you engage from starting to end. He is a genius and believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable.Pulp Fiction is an iconic masterpiece that redefined American cinema. Known for its nonlinear narrative, razor-sharp dialogue, and eclectic mix of humor and violence, the film weaves together multiple interconnected stories centered around the Los Angeles criminal underworld.This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone and all the actors give their career best performance.The ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .""Pulp Fiction"" explores themes of redemption, loyalty, violence, and the blurred lines between good and evil. It confronts these heavy subjects with dark humor and a self-awareness that challenges traditional genre conventions.""Pulp Fiction"" remains a landmark in cinema history, praised for its innovation, audacity, and lasting impact on popular culture. It continues to captivate audiences with its unforgettable characters, memorable scenes, and Tarantino's singular vision, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films ever made.So, if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It's movie which filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, and great soundtracks. This movie is just a spectacular experience.10/10🔥"
02/05/2023,3,"This film was a wild one. Definitely blew my earlier expectations of it out of the water. The way in which it is told is brilliant, with non-linear, seemingly random, disjointed plot lines, that all come together and manage to tell a story of their own. It's an extremely violent, drug filled, dirty, gritty, crazy film about crime, but it's also full of great, witty, and intelligent dialogue and it's full of minute things and details you may not pick up on at first. It was an entertaining and darkly humorous film, but it's also an intelligent and revolutionary one that broke new ground, that I'd definitely recommend watching it at least once."
21/04/2023,5,"After being in the Sundance Film Festival with the violent and brutal film ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino came back with one true awesome movie that had everything to be perfect. Pulp Fiction, considered to be one of the best movies ever made. In this violent movie there was very good acting, superb screenplay, great photography and of course, GREAT music. Everything a movie could ever need. Pulp Fiction won the Golden Palm at Cannes and the best original screenplay at the Academy Awards. For me, it has been the best movie ever made followed by Amores Perros. A film with very deep and strong content. Pulp Fiction is all about two hit men, their boss's pretty wife and a boxer. They get crossed while the movie advances, and the pieces of the puzzle begin to get together."
18/04/2023,4,Every Terintino film I've ever seen has been awesome. This is no exception. The movie is so good and just interesting he has like four stories and ends up connecting every single one. The movie is super intense at parts and then really funny at others. The part where Sam L. Jackson takes that guys big kahuna burger and is questioning him is so tense since you know he isn't making it out alive. Also one my hands down favorite parts in a movie ever is when John Travolta's gun goes off in the car and he's just like ah man I just shot Marvin in the face like it was just a little slip up. The guys head exploded h=in his car! Anyway incredible movie definitely watch.Also if you didn't know there is a theory that was confirmed by Terintino That all his films are connected.
18/04/2023,4,"Well I had heard a lot about this movie earlier but after seeing it I can only say that it is a below average movie. I mean the only thing I enjoyed was some dialogs (although most of them were out of context)and nice editing job.But the story ,if there was one was plain boring .Acting was OK except Samuel who was great. I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke. Also Bruce Willis part was half baked and had very little significance for the story.So overall this movie which is a ""so called classic"" disappoints because bits of comedy like the Bonnie situation are not enough to make a movie classic."
13/04/2023,4,"I approached this film with some trepidation. You see I am one of the seemingly very few people who really hated Reservoir Dogs. I found that movie to be extremely tedious. This however deserves all the plaudits it has received. Breakneck pacing & some of the funniest one-liners in movie history left me gasping for breath by the time it was over. Characters in a total panic as things go more & more wrong is a staple of film & TV comedy, but when overdone it can be really irritating. It's a tribute to both the actors & the director that this movie is never that."
25/03/2023,3,"Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success."
17/03/2023,3,"Tarantino might not be the best actor in the world and a lot of people just don't like him and his movies full stop but I really do think he has created a master piece when it comes to pulp fiction and if you ever get the chance to watch it in a movie theater take that opportunity with both hands.I think the real reason Tarantino has been able to make such a classic movie is because he is a film fan and only a film fan could have ever put together the pulp fiction movie and made it work, I watched pulp fiction on my 50"" plasma screen last weekend probably for the 20th time and it has everything, gangsters, hit men, drugs, comedy, extreme violence but most of all it has ""COOL"" this is the movie that makes you feel like smoking or giving up your day job and being someone more interesting...in reality cool is not very cool at all and you most likely end up dead but as far as movies go this is cool."
10/03/2023,3,"Pulp Fiction put non-linear out-of-order films on the map. With all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to see one that's essentially a puzzle you have to piece together. Each of the characters have some way of bumping into each other. As a departure from the grave tone of his first film, the indie hit Reservoir Dogs, this started Tarantino's signature style of excessively gory dark comedies with humorous observational dialogue. This film is bizarre, has some tense frantic moments, will make you laugh and is overall unlike any other film out there. It's biggest advantage, aside from Samuel Jackson and John Travolta having philosophical discussions about hamburgers, is the fact that it's volatile and it's completely impossible to predict what's next. This was a benchmark movie and, in some ways, a paradigm shift for the industry."
04/03/2023,3,"Well, it's a movie of all movies. You can watch it many times and not get bored. There will be always a number of people who won't like it but so what... I love it even though I felt like it's not mine in the first time, but later ""Fiction"" became one of my favorites."
02/03/2023,3,"Pulp Fiction is often considered the coolest and greatest film of all time. But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isn't.First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they don't.Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isn't a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess."
25/02/2023,8,"This is an absolutely amazing film. Great story. Great characters. The layout of the film is truly amazing and goes against the classical 3 stage story, almost as if it is 4 short films with multiple separate protagonists and antagonists. It breaks the norm of movie story telling and that's why it is so highly renowned in the movie industry. Definitely would recommend."
10/02/2023,8,"What is the big deal with this movie?  The movie SO boring, uninteresting, and full of a bunch of moronic and trashy characters.  I just don't get why people like this film so much.  It truly saddens me that this film has, for some god-awful reason, made it into IMDB's top 250 (and currently top 20). This film is most definitely in my bottom 250.Here are some of the many problems I had with this film:The scene where Bruce Willis' character was first introduced is one of the most visually painful scenes I've ever seen, I was ready to turn the movie off right there.  The camera just sits there on Bruce Willis' face and doesn't move for what seems to be an eternity.  What on earth was Quentin thinking?The best way to describe this movie is ""just a bunch of STUFF"", there's no real plot here and the story doesn't go anywhere?  I found it really hard to give a SH*T about any of the characters, and I couldn't care less if any of them got shot or killed.What was with that scene where Uma Thurman's character says ""Don't be a square"" and she forms a little square with her hands (If you haven't seen the movie then you won't know what I mean)?  That was so STUPID!!!  I just don't get stuff like that.  Too weird for me. ...And people call this a comedy?  Where the f&*k is the comedy?  Is it supposed to be funny when they go over the speed bump and shoot the guy in the back seat?  That isn't funny, that's SICK!  The only part that I laughed at was when John Travolta and Sam Jackson were talking about eating pork/bacon.  I thought that was a pretty funny conversation, but other than that I didn't find the movie funny at all.I'll never say ""don't waste you're time"" while referring to a movie, cause everybody has different tastes. So if you feel so inclined, go ahead and watch it, but I HATED it.  I hope you enjoy it more than I ever will. Thanks for putting up with my ranting and raving,-Chris"
10/02/2023,8,"Enjoyable movie, not dull or anything. Had quite the plot twists & absolutely bizarre and comical moments. The characters I was rooting for had a good ending, which i loved. It's sooo unpredictable, makes you think one thing's gonna happen because it has happened in so many other movies, but something entirely different happens & you're genuinely excited about it. This movie always keeps you on your toes. I love how everything was connected & the soundtrack fit perfectly.But just one thing I wanna know, WHAT WAS INSIDE THAT BRIEFCASE"
06/02/2023,8,"MORE MOVIES OF QT PLEASE!!!! I just read that he will only do 10 movies! No! Please, give him money to make movies so other generations could see what movies should be."
03/02/2023,8,"One of the classic of Tarantino, you wont regret watching this, you'll watch this again and again till you reach the IQ level of the filmmakers. I see film making is the highest value that one can obtain, It is (I believe) more valuable than prime minister and president of any country. Amazing movie."
29/01/2023,8,"Jules: What country are you from? Brett: (startled) What? Jules: ""What?"" is not a country I ever heard from.! They speak English in ""What?""? Brett: (startled) What? Jules: English, motherf***er! Do you speak it? Brett: Yes! It all started when two hit men are on their way to receive a suitcase and see their man. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson stars in this riveting and explosive crime drama about four tales about violence and redemption. Quentin Tarintino, who directed Reservior Dogs in 1992, takes four tales and makes a classic gangster tale. The movie is packed with screwy dialogue and extreme surprising characters. My reaction? My reaction was that Pulp Fiction was that it was funny, exciting, thrilling and excellent. Pulp Fiction was a worldwide explosion with audiences and critics saying the movie is fun, thrilling and funny throughout. I sat through Pulp Fiction one night watching it on AMC and I thought, this movie is fun. It's cool and crisp. At the end, it was all-out conclusion. Though the stories are out of sequence, it still can be fun without knowing characters in random areas. The movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. All in All, Pulp Fiction is a cool, riveting and exhilarating motion picture of the 1990's. ★★★★ 4 stars."
25/01/2023,8,"Entertaining beyond belief. If I were to direct a movie, I would choose Samuel L. Jackson hands down. He makes his movie gold. Combine his talent with Quentin Tarantino, and you've got double-gold. This movie deserves the number one spot on this site. Not only is it funny, it is clever, it has action, it has it all! A unique piece of work, it will have you scratching your head, & begging for more! It won so many awards & deserved to win best Director Oscar, but was beaten by Forrest Gump. Such a shame. That movie isn't in the #5 spot on this site. So undeserving. My review will not contain a spoiler as I have too much respect for this movie. I can't wait for the Grand Theft Auto movie to come out. Samuel L. Jackson will star in it for sure. It will be the best movie of all time, but until then I guess we'll all have to settle for Pulp Fiction. I've seen this movie over 100 times, and I never tire of it. There are many unique film-making traits the director has, such as non-linear story telling (probably something he invented), clever dialogue - all created from his own mind, specifically for this movie. Not written for a book or interpreted by someone else, it was his work exclusively & he deserves all the credit. A true genius. I can't wait to see what he thinks up next. I will be waiting in line. I hope he makes a movie to even rival his own work. I believe it can be done. Hopefully within the next couple of years. I wonder what he's up to right now, probably chilling with his piles of cash on top of a large pile of cocaine & naked ladies surrounding him. Damn that sounds good. He's my hero. A true man of men."
21/01/2023,8,"Pulp Fiction embodies everything that Tarantino does right, this witty, shocking, and entertaining film combines all his traits into one great film.All his trademarks are here: the unknown music that becomes instantly iconic, the gory action, the payoff, and the stream of entertaining characters.Extreme bias, but I cannot think of any issues with this well crafted gift of a film.A solid 10/10 from me."
19/01/2023,8,"I watched this damn straight at 12 in the morning this morning and I have to say I really enjoyed it. Bringing some of the greatest actors together: Urma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken & Ving Rhames. Having solid actors really pushes the films to it's greatest limits.For some minor things, including the retarded rape scene with the cop and I wish Urma & Smauel L. Jackson should be in the film a bit more. i'll go through all the positive things about the film.Dialogue, 10/10: The dialogue was hilarious and at times very powerful and the swearing was over the top which I loved.Storyline, 9/10: The plot was very stylish and very easy to catch all the time and I like the flash moment back at the start. SO I think that deserves tremendous credit.Acting, 10/10: Do i need to say anymore, it was freakin fantastic.Scenes, 10/10: Everything about this film is really great and all the scenes (except for the rape scene) excellent and well executed. Most of the time I found the scenes really funny and for good reason, for e.g. I found the $5 milk shake or the story of a watch, lol. Even the action is compelling.Everything is well stable in this film and I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't watched this yet. I'm so glad I watched this film NOW!!!!.I give it an easy 10/10"
10/01/2023,8,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines - it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" - there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats - and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's - well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10."
08/01/2023,9,"This incredible 90's classic which is written and directed by the amazing Quentin Tarantino is simply one of the most unpredictable film scripts that has ever made in my opinion. A script to be studied for many generations to come. The fact that the dialogue in this movie is so incredibly accurate makes the characters of this movie live in your mind forever, and through those characters Tarantino gives us so many iconic scenes that are impossible to forget. The movie has an amazing depth for every character in that world of crime created by Tarantino, one of the things that makes you want to watch this movie so many times for many years to come and it never gets old.For all who still did not watch this movie, you are really missing the ride of your life."
04/01/2023,9,"""Pulp Fiction"" has partly gone down in history as the movie that revived John Travolta's career, but it's more than that. A look into the lives of several criminals, it's likely to shake up almost anyone. The first time that I ever saw the movie, my dad (who'd already seen it) sent me out of the room for the scene where Bruce Willis...well, I won't spoil it in case you haven't seen it. Also, while we were watching it, I was cracking up at the language - I can't even count how many curse words they used. This is one movie that will probably never get shown on network TV - they would probably have to cut more than half the movie (including Samuel L. Jackson's wallet).All in all, director Quentin Tarantino created a real masterpiece here. Top-notch acting (that spawned some famous lines) and a great script combined for a real treat. Uma Thurman's scene might make some people's skin crawl, but if not, then enjoy."
26/12/2022,8,"To me the movie had no plot and was merely an excuse to depict one form of violence after another; with no intent to tell a story, make a point, or to get the audience intellectually or emotionally involved with the movie."
16/12/2022,7,"Simply brilliant. The icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence , the extended dialogue riffing, the trance-like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly  above all else, the sheer direction less excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. In 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s Britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, you name it. Everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but without his brilliance it just looked smug. (The Americans get Tarantino; we get Guy Ritchie and Jeremy Clarkson.)"
10/12/2022,7,"After ""Reservoir Dogs"", Quentin Tarantino directs his second most popular movie the ""Pulp Fiction"". In this movie Quentin Tarantino won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen with Roger Avary.I liked this movie very much because it's a vertebrate movie such ""Amores Perros"" and ""Night on earth"". I also liked it because of the cast and their performances. Especially the performances of John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman was extraordinary.I recommend this movie to you because I think that movie reflects the new generation that came with Quentin Tarantino at the wheel!"
07/12/2022,8,"No wonder Pulp Fiction will remain a cult classic and certainly one of the definitive movie in cinema history.The beauty of this classic is the variety of interpretation it allows.Multiple viewing always refines our thoughts about this movie. Parallel tales converging to a convincing ending is certainly a different genre.Tarantino and Guy Ritchi are the masters in this genre.Sometimes different screenplay makes a movie unforgettable and surely this was the case in Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction is a cult classic and one of the movie that will stay in the viewers mind for a long time but certainly not a popcorn movie(a spiritual movie in my opinion) . Pulp Fiction is a philosophical fiction with a tinge of humor added to it. S.L.Jackson was amazing as Winnfield and Thurman excels as Mia and not to mention Bruce Willis but I felt rather disappointed with Travolta. A very satisfying movie but not an entertaining(depends upon the way you define entertainment) one. I recommend ""Snatch"" and ""Lock,Stock.."",if you want a more entertaining movie from the same genre. My score 8/10..If you are a serious movie buff..Go for Pulp Fiction"
06/12/2022,8,"This is a picture about mindless killing and idiots who think it is funny. Why so many people think highly of this picture is entirely beyond my fat rear end. The fact that so many people rate this picture so highly does not say good things about our society in general. When I bring up how disgusting this picture is to people whom love it, I get a multitude of answers that amount to nothing more than academic masturbation. Some people have the audacity to say it is a comedy. Somehow , I never thought mindless killing and standing around and laughing about it was comedy. ""Ha ha ha ha, he just got his head blown off"". ""That was so damn funny that I can't stop laughing."" Other people say it's a serious satire. ""It's supposed to show you the way the world really is."" Wow like I need to waste my time and money to tell me we live in a sick world. Simply put, if you like this film, you need to get your head examined."
03/12/2022,8,"Tarrantino did what he set out to do in Pulp Fiction - making a wacky, nonlinear piece of entertainment full of gratuitously over-the-top dialogue (or monologue) and violence. He made that clear even in the title; it's just a highly charged but disposable fiction. He succeeded quite nicely.
However, many his fans are trying to make it more than what it is, a cool but undemanding movie. While it's refreshing compared to typical banality supplied by mainstream Hollywood, it's far from a truly great classic some fans want people to believe. Interestingly, that's probably not Tarrantino's intention in the first place"
30/11/2022,10,"When pulp fiction came out it was w new form of order a new way of editing and visualizing the sequence of the story telling style
plenty of people from the cinema industry were against the film at once now they know how was Tarantino ahead of time.Similar feedback was against Victoria the German movie by Sebastian shipper
hoping that the industry will be more open to change of view."
26/11/2022,10,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a work of postmodern art. It's unlike any film I've seen before, and because of that, I commend it for not searching for a blueprint or a formula to tell its story. Tarantino tells the story from pure originality, and like many of his future films, Pulp Fiction is told with a non-linear narrative making it hard to explain the plot. It's better to just introduce the characters and go from there.The story is about very different people whose lives intertwine with one another over the course of a few days. The characters first introduced are Pumpkin (Roth) and ""Honey Bunny"" (Plummer) who are talking in a dinner with plans to conduct a heist. We then cut to two detectives named Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Jackson) who are trying to retrieve a briefcase they can bring to their boss Marsellus Wallace (Rhames).Wallace has his own chapter in the film as well. Him and prizefighter Butch Coolidge (Willis) strike a deal where Butch accepts a large amount of money to throw an upcoming fight. While Wallace is tied up in this deal, Vega goes over to meet and take to dinner the lovely Mrs. Mia Wallace (Thurman). A series of events happen, causing dismay among Vega which lead to some very well-written and well-acted sequences.Being that the film is conducted in a very nontraditional style, Pulp Fiction is a task to follow sometimes. My advice; watch it and just go along with it. If you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead, or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too. Viewing multiple clips for a second time, I think I finally understand it more, but a lot of questions you'll still be asking after repeated viewings.One of the most famous questions is ""what's in the briefcase?"" that is recovered by Vega and Winnfield in the early scenes of the film. I'm sure when writing the film Tarantino himself didn't know what he wanted to put in the briefcase. I'm also sure he didn't think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth.What truly makes Pulp Fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog. Tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan. One moment the two are discussing why a Quarter Pounder With Cheese from McDonalds is called a ""Royale With Cheese"" in France. Next, they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question ""what?"" again.Why do I not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films, but for some reason award a perfect score to a film that is made up of it? Because Pulp Fiction shows how it should be done. It depicts realistic situations, handled intelligently and with wit and soul. It doesn't utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary, but to advance an already crafty storyline. The character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words. Is it necessary? Not really. But Pulp Fiction isn't just about swearing. It proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade.Starring: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Maria de Medeiros, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis, and Quentin Tarantino. Directed by: Quentin Tarantino."
10/11/2022,9,"If you go over to your dictionary and look up the word cool, you'll likely find Pulp Fiction the definition for it along with a picture of Quentin Tarantino next to it. When the credits hit the screen at the end of this movie a certain feeling rises in my throat. Unlike some other of my favorite movies, where I look at the world around me differently for a few hours, at the end of Pulp Fiction I'm simply struck by a feeling of ""Whoa, that was cool."" This movie could be called genius and I would agree. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director and this was the first movie of his I saw and I have to admit that almost at first when I was watching it I felt that sort of ADD that I feel if I'm watching an okay movie. I was squirming around until the first shot was fired and then I sat for the next hour or so and was stunned. If you have not seen this movie, you MUST go out right now to your local video store and rent Pulp Fiction. It will change you, and you may find that you have a new favorite movie."
06/11/2022,10,"I can't believe people told me this was a horrible movie. I spent quite some time avoiding it because of the negative feedback. Now that I've finally seen it, all I can say is WOW! This was a truly great movie. Great acting, great dialogue, and it is not as violent as some people make it out to be. Definitely a must see."
27/10/2022,10,"I only viewed it for the first time a couple of months and I have to say from the moment go I loved it. It is a fascinating tale of how the main characters meet and how their paths cross over the course of the movie. I am not sure how people view it but I see Pulp Fiction as a series of episodes in one movie,my favourite being the one with Bruce Willis and what happens to him after he kills someone in the boxing ring. Another thing I loved was the star power in this movie:Uma Thurman,John Travolta,Samuel L Jackson,Bruce Willis, Christopher Walker Ving Rhames to name a few. What makes the movie so remarkable is that we as the viewers do not see the twist coming. Another quite remarkable thing about Pulp Fiction is that the conversations between the characters is actually engrossing. Pulp Fiction is a fascinating tale masterfully directed by Quentin Tarranantino."
25/10/2022,10,"What makes a movie unforgettable? A movie that will burn in your mind forever, and you'd always want to see it, again and again? I don't know, but most certainly Pulp Fiction has that secret formula. The wide range of (good!) actors is fascinating, and the gangster plot is more than thrilling at times.It's even hard to say what is this movie about... What's the purpose? Can't say. It looks, like its name, Pulp Fiction, but, when you look deeper into it, you find the plot to be unforgettable, along with classic moments such as ""How do they call half a pound of cheeseburger in Europe"".I think that's a proof to what a talented director and script writer can do with a couple of well done and furbished dialogs, a thrilling plot and an original, time-leaping plot timing.In short - No, it's not one of those 'So bad that it's good"" movies, it's simply a good one. Watch it, and I promise you you'll never forget it."
24/10/2022,10,"What's fantastic about Tarantino is his ability to make films that are entertaining throughout. He does this in part by having his characters discuss off subject things, which really helps the characters, and doesn't hinder performance in any way. He's absolutely fantastic at writing dialogue, and it really adds to it.Pulp Fiction feels vibrant. Pulp Fiction feels alive. And far from interminable, it knows exactly what direction it going in. It feels fresh and innovative due to the clever story structure, that doesn't feel convoluted at all. The story structure to me actually aids the ending, and the film as a whole. Incredibly clever stuff from Tarantino. Over time Tarantino films have become more and more bloated, but this and Reservoir dogs were perfectly restrained films. To be both wild and restrained at the same time to me is an impressive feat. Performance wise I think everyone here is on top form. It's an interesting cast, and a brave cast, but it absolutely fits. I enjoyed Willis more than usual, as he seems more free and relaxed. Travolta is handled very well, which is something that I would have thought is very hard to do. His characters need to be tongue in cheek and that's certainly the case here.For me this is a film that can only really be done once. Doing away with narrative structure in this way gives it a completely unique feel whilst still being compelling. I think few could pull this off, in fact I doubt even Tarantino could pull it off again. For bravery, creative spark, unique tone, awesome writing, and pure entertainment value, I can't not give this a ten.Ten out of Ten."
16/10/2022,10,"I just love Tarantino. This movie is amazing, I love the characters and the actors/actresses, specially Uma. If you're not a fan of violence this is not your movie, it touches some sensible themes like drugs or murderer. Something that I really like from the movie is that you can see more than one point of view, so you will entertain way more because they're all connected. I think everyone love the dance scene of John Travolta and Uma Thurman, and I think that deserves to be watched for everyone at least ones. This is definitely one of the best Quentin Tarantino's movies and I'll always recommend it."
14/10/2022,10,"There's actually quite a lot of one star reviews for this which are hilarious, if you're bored and want a laugh give them a read. The only people who can't appreciate this are probably children, geriatrics, god botherers, and those on the autism spectrum."
14/10/2022,10,"Let me start of with saying this is my opinion and if you do like this movie great. I'm not trying in anyway to diminish that joy. Just want to voice my own opinion. Now I love Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs and Inglorious Bastards are two of my all time favorite movies but this.... is a huge disappointment. The multiple narratives we're interesting at first but soon you realise they are pointless. More filler than anything else. It has no real pay off for this except I guess for the viewer to connect and understand each character. But it didn't do that for me. The ending is fine, the story is meh and the characters are very fake feeling. I don't know why but they came off very artificial except Samuel L. Jackson. The directing is amazing as to be expected and the cinematography is great. But don't let my review hold you back from seeing this movie. Even though I disliked the narrative and storyline the directing, acting and cinematography are hugely enjoyable as always with any Tarantino film. So if your a movie fan or interested in any aspect of film making you should definitely give this I watch. (However I would recommend you watch Tarantino's other work first)"
14/10/2022,10,"I saw this movie when it was just past it's prime at a dollar theater and boy was I ripped off!! This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. It, along with Fargo and Natural Born Killers are my top 3 worst films. I have no problem with films that are quirky but this film made absolutely no sense to me. Sometimes I will give a film a second chance and watch it again thinking maybe it was just my mood on that particular day but I would never waste my time on this movie again."
07/10/2022,10,"Man, I don't know how to explain this, let alone how to start. This movie is just the best EVER. Everything is perfect!!! My big time favorite is the dialogues, S L Jackson and J Travolta are just PERFECT, best dialogues ever. Also the setting is always great, I could watch that movie for days without getting bored. And of course the story is great, how everything flows over in each other, superb! And of course what I REALLY liked of this, all the information in the movies, all the hidden things in the movie that you don't notice after watching it just one time, makes it so mysterious! It is not just a 3 hour movie, there is sooooo much more to discover! Well, that was my opinion about the best movie ever, also (of course) Tarantino's best work. The four rooms was oke, Kill Bill too commercial.LATER! Wouter"
29/09/2022,10,"There is not much that can be said about Pulp Fiction that hasn't been said countless times before, it is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and is never far away from the number one spot on many peoples lists. Acting – Spot on. Characters – Spot on.Script – Spot on. Storyline – almost non-existent but isn't that the point? Spot on. Soundtrack – Spot on. Editing – Spot on. Quentin Tarantino – Genius.Pulp Fiction is a complete joy to watch. John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson give the performances of their careers. Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames & 'The Wolf' all give great supporting performances also.Pulp Fiction is an utterly pointless film; it is a movie that relies heavily on its characters and their scripts. The storyline is basic and feels unfinished but that is the entire point! It is a movie about nothing, it's simply a snippet into the lives of the characters and the timeline is all over the place, jumping backwards and forwards throughout the film. It follows two hit-men, a gangster, an underground boxer, drug dealers & a man who is contracted to get people out of the stickiest of situations, with complete calm!As 'perfect' as it is, I do have a problem with it. It's a controversial problem no doubt, and that is Bruce Willis and his hour long scene in the centre of this movie. I wouldn't say I dislike Bruce Willis as such but I do find him somewhat irritating and when I watch Pulp Fiction I do skip his scenes. In my opinion he isn't relevant and I don't feel the film would have missed his presence if he wasn't involved. This however doesn't affect my feelings for the film as a whole as the scenes with Jackson & Travolta are faultless and some of my favourite scenes in cinema. I consider Pulp Fiction to be a masterpiece.10/10"
29/09/2022,10,"I first saw this movie when I was 14, and I still remember it as being the movie that made me realize just how much I loved movies. It also started a love affair with Quentin Tarantino that lasts to this day. The movie was well paced, and even though it was presented out of sequence, it wasn't too hard to follow along. The characters were interesting and compelling, and you cared about them despite the fact that most of them weren't very nice people. But more that anything, this movie proved to me that with the right characters, the right script, and the right director a movie can be so powerful and compelling that it can leave us in love with it after the very first viewing. I may be biased. I have seen this movie well over 90 times. (Once a month, like clockwork.) I can often say the lines in the movie in time with the characters, and I am known to quote Sam Jackson's scene from the apartment word for word. But just because I may be a little obsessed doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth every second I've spent with it. If you haven't seen it, run and buy it! Don't just rent it, buy it! If you are a fan of film noir, buy it! If you like movies with a realistic feel, buy it! It will more than likely be a purchase you won't regret."
25/09/2022,10,"This is an excellent movie. It has been given a lot of negative publicity because of its violence, language, drug use etc. however none of it is actually gratuitous and the language and drug use in context. After all, Pulp Fiction is a gangster film. A number of things make Pulp Fiction one of the great classics of all time and a must see for all movie fans. It is humorous, action-packed, exciting and is thought-provoking. Pulp Fiction is basically three chronologically jumbled stories concerning two hit men (Travolta and Jackson); two armed robbers (Roth and Plummer) a drug dealer (Stoltz); a prize fighter (Willis); a criminal underworld boss (Rhames) and his wife (Thurman). Apart from the absolutely ingenious plotting of the film, Pulp Fiction also puts across the messages of redemption and faith, often in hysterical ways. The bloody action is prevalent in the film however infrequent and not distracting. The coarse language can be a detracting factor, with strong language throughout however this all must be taken in context. Overall a fantastic film and Tarantino must be applauded, not condemned for it."
24/09/2022,10,It's a great in-depth movie with many perspectives and different stories. It shows multiple stories of different people and connects them in a creative and well written way that successfully pulls the story together. The movie doesn't get borings and is very eventful.This movie contains very mature topics and when I watched it I was probably a bit to immature and I did not get the proper meaning and topics. But I'll rewatch in the future to really understand the movie. Overall it deserves the hype and I understand why filmbros glaze this movie.Would recommend if you wanna watch a meaningful and deep movie but wouldn't if you just want some entertainment.
24/09/2022,10,"How can I trust in imdb rating any more?
Long story short. It was made to waste your time and mine watching 4 people puting their brains under pressure to get rid of a corpse and his blood in a car. Very exciting indeed. I could not blink.
Or maybe it was made to show a man loosing his virginity as punishment. What an Incredible story and full of deep meaning.
Don't believe 9 rating for this crap. I don't know were does it come from."
23/09/2022,10,Yes that's right this movie is perfect. Every crime drama/comedy out there can try as hard as it wishes but it will never ever surpass Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction follows the story of to very likable hit man Vince and Joules (John Travolta and Sam Jackson) and a boxer who is in a lot of trouble (Bruce Willis). There story's are both compelling and original and eventually they run across each other. If you have seen any other Tarentino film you will know how he tells the story with flashbacks and eventually it all comes together. Quinten Tarentino's movies always have a certain amount of character and dialog that make them what they are. Pulp fiction is one of those films which you can't think of anything it lacks. Well I thought may be it could have used more action but if it did it wouldn't be what it is.So all in all buy this movie right now watch it love it remember it because it will be a long time before someone makes another crime drama/comedy this good. My grade:A+ definitely one of the best movies ever.
18/09/2022,10,"I will always turn to Pulp Fiction when I think of a favorite movie. Apart from the cultural impact that it has, one cannot deny the fact that as a movie, technically speaking, is excellent. What to think of first? The dialogs are epic, Tarantino cannot top this as far as he tries with his newest movies. The photography is plain and simple as it fits in the background of the film. The acting is...oh god. Give these guys three Oscars. One to Samuel, one to John and one to Bruce. They all deserve it. The movie starts in a rush and does not calm down for a moment... which is good...Every one can find his / her favor scene. Grats to Tarantino for this excellent piece of art. I believe that it will remain high on my / yours ratings for a very long time."
16/09/2022,10,"Pulp Fiction has been my all-time favorite film for a couple of years now and I have seen many films in the past but nothing can out beat the film. Everything about the film was magnificent. The script, by one of my favorite directors Quentin Tarantino, is the best writings I have ever seen. The performances were brilliant. All of them played their roles perfectly especially Samuel L. Jackson, who played Jules Winnfield. The direction, camera view, dialouge, and humour were all amazing in this one of the most popular films ever made. Overall, in my opinion nothing can out stand Pulp Fiction and its flawless scenes. It definitely set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history and that is why Pulp Fiction is the greatest film ever made.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
11/09/2022,10,"Pulp Fiction was an excellent movie. Quentin Tarantino showed us filmmaking at its best. Well-written, well-acted, well-executed. Story: 10/10. We're watching several stories at the same time, and in one way or another, they're connected. I can't say too much without spoiling it, so I won't.Characters: 10/10. The characters are so diverse, yet they fit into place.Acting: 10/10. With talent like Tim Roth, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman (and Phil LaMarr), do I really have to go into detail?Execution: 10/10. As said before, Pulp Fiction is filmmaking at its best.Pulp Fiction was great. There's really no reason to explain it. It just is. Hands down. Final Score: 10/10."
07/09/2022,10,"Pulp Fiction just may be the best movie that has ever graced film, thats including Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and Gone With The Wind. anyone who says that its just a ""violent, profanity filled movie"" is not only wrong but very stupid. Just cause something is violent doesn't make it a bad movie, and people should learn that there's a difference between pointless violence and violence in context. Tarantino does a good job making his character's ""real"". they have conversation's that sound like something that you would say to your buddy on the way to work. it also has some of the best acting EVER. in my opinion it should have won over Forrest gump at the 1994 acadamy awards, don't get me wrong i loved Forrest gump but pulp fiction was better. Pulp Fiction is a must see for anyone who consider's them self to be a film buff, or anyone looking for a good movie to watch over and over again."
07/09/2022,10,"Already a classic, ""Pulp Fiction"" never ceases to bring pleasure when reviewed (already reviewed 5 or 6 times...)Tarantino's legendary dialogues, which don't tire and don't lull, which many films currently sin, unfortunately.Excellent, seasoned humor, without stupid and inappropriately inserted memes, which, again, are now present in many films, unfortunately.Although Tarantino's other works are also very famous, such as Kill Bill, Django, Reservoir Dogs etc, but, in my opinion, it was this work that gave rise to this wonderful cohort of films, their style.Highly recommended for the younger generation to see what a really good movie is."
04/09/2022,10,"This is truly a great film, and always enjoyable no matter how many times you view it! Probably the BEST performance ever by Samuel L. Jackson! The fact that he didn't get the Oscar nomination for this film, and Travolta did is totally a joke. I cant say enough to do his performance justice. If you like Samuel L. Jackson this is a MUST SEE! Also the scene with Tarantino himself is very funny! The way Tarantino ties all the various related plot lines together is masterful. Truly a work of art by one of the most exciting film makers working today. The action never stops, and by the end of the film you're left wishing there was more! I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
29/08/2022,7,"This is, in my opinion, the most over-rated film of all time. Sure, there is some snappy dialogue here and there, and Tarantino has a good ear for music, but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie, nor the godlike status bestowed upon Tarantino himself.It's over-stylised, over-loud, over-acted, (sorry Samuel, Tim, John, Uma & Bruce) and the non-linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesn't work.But it's fashionable, so it's popular.By the way, this is one of the few films where I've actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end, so I guess I'm not the only one who didn't like it."
23/08/2022,7,"This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities about it and that is why I think it is one of the best to come along in quite awhile!  Don't look for this to be an uplifting or moving experience.  All there is to see is the disgusting underbelly of society, which I think needs to be shown. Tarantino may have blown his mental load on this picture but that is o.k. The dialog is just top notch.  I haven't really told you anything about the movie but this is just the best example of what the movie is about....nothing.  But it still kicks ass."
23/08/2022,7,"This is the film that confirmed Tarantino as being not only a top writer in Hollywood but as a stylish director as well. ""Pulp fiction"" pulls you in from the first moment and doesn't let go.Whatever a person could want from a film, ""pulp fiction"" delivers. Fast and witty dialogue, stylish direction, strong performances, flawless editing, fun and popular songs, and a unique approach to telling the story. Quentin is one of the few writer/directors that has the ability to have a movie be highly accessible as well as being filled with true style and entertaining substance. It's art that everyone loves. I've never met a person who didn't like pulp fiction and it's rare to meet someone who hasn't seen it. All these actors are giving career best performances from Samuel L Jackson to Harvey keitel, hell, even John travolta got an Oscar nomination for his role as the lead, Vincent Vega. The writing has a good ebb and flow between comedy and drama, sometimes a combination of the two. I can't say anything about this film that hasn't already been said. I'm just writing this review so I can strengthen my writing and this is my first review so cut me some slack. Don't be a square and get ready for an adrenaline fueled masterpiece of a movie."
22/08/2022,7,"I'm not into writing reviews, but IMDb asked me to do it. And considering the fact that tomorrow I have an exam and I don't want to start preparing for it, I would better write this shitty words instead of studying. So, I've watched this movie for the goddamn unknown time and it's still entertaining as a freaking Disneyland for adults. And, by the way, I must admit that minimum size of 10 lines is a really brutal torture for me, as I'm suffering from a lack of imagination as hell. And the film is still amazing, yeah, don't forget that this text is supposed to be about Pulp Fiction. In conclusion, I'd like to shout out to my mom, my sister, my cat Partisan and my beautiful girlfriend. Their support really helped me to write this review and to overcome this terrible challenge. This looks like the end. I hope nobody will really read this."
21/08/2022,6,"this movie is painfully overrated: every time someone tells me that pulp fiction is their favorite movie of all time, I die a little bit inside. Mind you, it's not a terrible movie, it has style and memorable moments, but nothing THAT great that justifies the hype among these pseudo intellectuals. You know the type: these college kids who just love Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, probably jerk off to Bukowski's poetry, think Kubrick is THE GREATEST DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME, absolutely LOVE to bash religion and make sure everyone knows they're an atheist, and yet still manage to think they're better than you. The sad thing about Pulp Fiction is that I used to enjoy it when I was younger, wasn't my favorite movie of all time, but was definitely on the top 10. Watching it now, having endured thousands of these guys and their egos, left me bitter and annoyed. I realized that I didn't even speak all that much about the movie, sorry about that, I'm just salty."
20/08/2022,6,"The movie features a non-linear narrative structure, interweaving several different storylines that revolve around the Los Angeles criminal underworld. The film has an amazing cast which includes John Travolta, Uma Thurman, and Samuel L. Jackson, who deliver electrifying performances that are both humorous and suspenseful.I've rated Pulp Fiction a 10 out of 10 as its sharp dialogue, stylish direction, and iconic soundtrack make it a feast for the senses each time I've watched it, and I can't deny the cultural impact its had on the art of cinema. Despite its violent subject matter, its a wildly entertaining and smart film that remains just as fresh and relevant today as it was when it was first released in 94. If you're a fan of innovative filmmaking, great music, and unforgettable characters, then Pulp Fiction is the movie for you!"
19/08/2022,6,"It has amazing storytelling. It has a non-linear storytelling, and it's done very well. Actings, musics are awesome in every Tarantino movie. It don't have so many violance but it is not a very big problem. The main problem of this movie for me the story of the movie. It is not bad but it is pointless. Yes he died, yes he left the job but then what ? After that what happened ? We don't know that. The only thing that i don't like about Tarantino movies is that. Only Inglourious Basterds and Kill Bill Vol. 2 broke that for me. Cinematography is not so good but no so bad too. Dialogues are so good in all Tarantino movies."
19/08/2022,6,"Pulp Fiction, arguably the most iconic movie from culturally iconic filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, is an exhilarating ride that combines comedy, drama, violence, and a nonlinear narrative. Featuring some of Hollywood's most remarkable talents, like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, this film delights with its dark humor and edgy cinematography.Pulp Fiction follows several intertwined stories involving a mid-level hitman Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who takes orders from his mafia boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Accompanying him is Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), his colleague and comic relief who brings wisecracks and quotable lines to every scene. They are tasked with recovering a briefcase of mysterious contents stolen by two small-time crooks working for Marcellus Wallace- Honey Bear (Quentin Tarantino) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth). We soon learn that the case holds tremendous importance as it contains items that could potentially destroy Marcellus Wallace's reputation if they fall into the wrong hands.Further complications arise when Vincent Vega takes Marcellus Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for an evening adventure at Jack Rabbit Slims diner, where they compete in a twisting competition before she overdoses from drugs prompting Stoltz's memorable line, ""She was brought here by YOU; thus YOU inserted the needle!"" Meanwhile, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is another criminal who must take a risky detour back to his apartment with Maria de Medeiros as his innocent girlfriend to retrieve an important family heirloom-a wristwatch passed down through generations-and Christopher Walken as the grizzled war hero ready to exact revenge on Butch should he fail to comply with his demands.Tarantino has crafted a masterful script richly detailed in dialogue that captures humor and drama more powerfully than any other writer/director today. His collaboration with Roger Avary has yielded one of the most memorable scripts in recent memory, filled with characters that simultaneously evoke laughter, sorrow, and empathy unlike anything else. It often feels like Tarantino himself inhabits these characters throughout their various plot points as he explores themes of morality in crime fiction while simultaneously poking fun at them.Pulp Fiction features dazzlingly kinetic cinematography from frequent collaborators Robert Richardson and Andrzej Sekula, which exquisitely captures both the frenetic energy of an urban underworld filled with criminals but also creates moments of interiority amongst its inhabitants which allows us to see them not just as criminals but human beings too whose lives we can understand even if we don't condone their actions or lifestyles. This combination of frenetic visuals coupled with heartfelt emotion makes for one electrifying experience that sticks long after you've watched it.What makes Pulp Fiction so special is how Quentin Tarantino manages to slyly explore moral grey areas without becoming preachy or sacrificing entertainment value either; it exists somewhere between spectacle and philosophy while giving its viewers room to come up with conclusions on their own terms while still asking more critical questions about life itself, especially when it comes to morality in crime. The casting is also top-notch, featuring some of Hollywood's best, from Travolta and Jackson to Willis & Thurman, all delivering career-best performances that reverberate years after its original release date making this one movie worth watching again & again! 10/10."
16/08/2022,6,A True test of how great a movie is .. is how well it. Still plays almost 30 years later ... well done. Quentin. And 30 years from now Django will too. Thanks for all of your movies.
06/08/2022,7,"I casually watch movies, and have seen a lot of Tarantino, and this movie was definitely on par. Old but good, and Samuel Jackson and John Travolta are really very entertaining in this movie. In addition, the story is told in a very unorthodox style. The characters are developed, but not overly so. The dialogue is great to watch and the action is typical of this kind of move. The story is a good one, complex enough to keep interest but not too complicated like other films can be. From beginning to end, he has you interested. The themes of the movie are very different in nature from one and other but come together very nicely in the end. I know this might not be insightful, in anyway, but it is truthful, I personally really enjoyed this movie. But who am I to say."
31/07/2022,9,"Rather than dwell on any bad points - are their any? I must have watched & tremendously enjoyed this film 6x in the last year!! and probably the equivalent every year since it was released.Tarantino's mark on all his films is evident - and yes it's obvious he's using his childhood experience or dreams? in his fantastic ability to make stunning films.& to top it off the 360 filming of this piece is a pleasure to behold? Never ever get bored of the quality this artist delivers, nor do my 16 & 18 year old sons.One of the best Directors & Writers ever!"
25/07/2022,9,"Pulp Fiction' was one of the best films of the '90s. With it's superb performances, and a masterfully told story, through flashbacks and a plot that has more twists and turns than any English country lane, pulp fiction remains and shall ever be a fine piece of work.Tarantino's blend of so many different styles of music, ranging from the likes of Dusty Springfield and Chuck Berry, mixed with the visceral characters of everyday life, makes it a delight to watch again and again.There are some spectacular moments, like Butch's surprise when he sees Marcellus at a traffic light. What follows is the best bits of the movie. With a jerky hand-held camera we move from the car crash into a random shop where the owner knocks out Butch, after he knocks out Marcellus.A key theme follows when Butch escapes, redemption. Butch goes back with a samurai sword to free Marcellus and himself of being in Marcellus's debt.What's my verdict? If you haven't seen this film, then you haven't lived"
21/07/2022,9,"Pulp Fiction could be my favorite movie, but that always changes. I will say that I consider Pulp Fiction to be the best movie of the 90's, with only Goodfellas and The Big Lebowski coming close. The cast has top notch chemistry, featuring the best performances of most of their careers. Travolta and Jackson's duo is one of the most memorable and entertaining in the history of cinema. Tarantino's dialogue and direction come together to make one of the most quoted, most watchable, and most influential films of the 90's. Tarantino misorders the films acts chronologically, to the effect of telling a character centered story in the most satisfying way possible. This has been attempted many times since, but never equaled. Tarantino's best film, a modern classic."
21/07/2022,9,"Pulp Fiction. Yeah.. what can I say about this that hasn't been already. I'll keep it personal, as it should be. For some reason I ended up watching Pulp Fiction as late as the day I write this review. Having seen the countless clips and memes of certain scenes I was anything but blind going into a certain parts of the movie.But I didn't come out of this thinking.. wat an incredible experience. It leans more towards a mixed bag with some diamonds, and a few less interesting emeralds. But I can recognize why it is so loved, and how smart it is, the how's, the why's. It's incredibly well made. No doubt. It was great. But I never captured me more than.. great. Film fanatics wil go on and on about this for sure, there's enough depth to dissect. But as a movie I'm not so sure I'd be bothered to watch it again anytime soon. Especially some of it's less interesting parts.What might be the real kicker for most of the ''lower'' reviews is whether the humor hits you or doesn't. It's played incredibly flat, in action and dialog. And normally I can really appreciate that but here none of the comedic moments, like the entire cleaning scene with Jimmy and the cleaning guy did anything for me. Though most of Travolta's scenes WERE great to me. So this movie is a real mixed bag in the end for me personally.Acting and characters are fantastic without a doubt, not just the performances but also the writing steals the show here. For me the first half very much wins it out from the second. The boxer story and the cleaning story just never hit home for me. The way the story combines is cool, but again, only really fortifies my preference for the first half of the movie.Travolta really turned out to be my honorable mention, of course everyone else is great too. Besides.. well.. seeing the director in his own movie. Look.. I thought in Reservoir Dogs it was done perfectly, early in and out, not too long. But he takes a lot of screentime here, and I sadly can't see beyond ''hey, that's the director!''. Whilst I obviously can with the other actors. It's a thing. In a scene I already don't like. Whatever. Fine. Just wish it was more subtle.So yeah. In 1994, this must've been an even bigger event in that era of movies. But for now. I thought it was great, but for me it's not gonna stick beyond the few famous scenes we already know and love."
18/07/2022,9,This masterpiece kept my attention for its entirety through its unique storytelling style thanks to Quentin Tarantino. This will now be my go-to when somebody asks for a suggestion. If I had to put in in one word: wow.
08/07/2022,9,"I really enjoyed it, even though I did not watch the film until recently, I enjoyed watching it! It was a cool action packed film from the 80s.I only heard about it recently from a friend that kept repeating a quote from the movie, we were in French class so you can guess the quote lol."
07/07/2022,9,"Throughout movie history there have been a few films that come along and change the way you look at movies and this is one of them.  This movie is one of the best of all time.  This movie has you cheering for criminals.Samuel L. Jackson's performance in Pulp Fiction was amazing.  He made you truly believe that he was a hitman with morals and doubts.  The end scene at the coffe shop was truly stirring.  ""But I'm trying, Ringo. I'm trying real hard to be the shepard.""Quentin Tarantino is one of the best writers ever.  His dialect makes this movie extremely enjoyable.  And though a great deal of the movie is talking it never seems slow."
28/06/2022,9,"This film is amazing! Pulp Fiction is the kind of film which must be seen. You should either rent it or I suggest buy it so you can watch it. The story depicts a harsh L.A underworld practically ruled by a man named Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and how he sends two hit men to carry out a hit. The story is told out of sequence which adds to the pure awe of this film. With an all star cast including: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi (a little bit), and even Quentin Tarantino himself, this film is pure enjoyment start to finish. This film is a modern classic. Do not miss it because you'll hear everybody else talking about it."
27/06/2022,9,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
25/06/2022,9,"Absolute GeniusPulp Fiction is THE film of the 90's. A film lover's  dream, this Tarantino masterpiece combines an original plot, superb acting and a script to satisfy even the toughest critics. Quentin Tarantino is a pure genius,  combining definite ability with unmatched originality in this brilliant black comedy/gangsta flick!!"
22/06/2022,9,"Saw Pulp Fiction today, and the only think I could say after it was...wow. 2 and a half straight hours of brilliant, but quite bloody. This was one of the best movies ever made, but also, maybe the most disturbing film of the 90's. This enforces my hypothesis that Q. Tarintino is a sick f**k, but a brilliant one.One other thing I noticed about the film was the number of ""f bombs"" dropped. Its like the only word people can say in L.A. is the ""f"" word. Language wise, this film made a George Carlin show look like Mr. Rogers. It made South Park look Tiny Toons. I'm not saying that profanity is all that bad, its just...did it really need so many? Soanyway, I would not suggest Pulp Fiction to the weak at heart or those partial to hard language, you will not believe your ears. Apart from that, see Pulp Fiction, its a great movie."
17/06/2022,9,"This is a great movie.  I rented it this past weekend and I thought John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson were great in the film.  It's a little violent, but overall it's a great film.  The movie is actually three stories that are put together.  It was full of crime and action.  Two thing that I like.  The film could have done without all the cursing.  This isn't a film for the kids.  However, it was a great film.  The three stories fitted perfectly into one another.  However, it did have its slow moments.  This is an automatic classic.  It has some memorable scenes that should be watched over and over again.  Overall, I gave the movie a 8 out of 10.  The other cast members included such names as Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames and Tim Roth.  I would also recommend The Matrix, The Godfather or The Godfather Part II."
14/06/2022,9,"I must start by saying that I am NOT a fan of Tarantino. I have seen a couple of his other films and thought, to be blunt, they were absolute crap. From them I gained the impression that his films were no more than violence, blood & gore thinly disguised by a weak plot and/or pretentious artiness. I had no plans to see 'Pulp Fiction' and would have avoided it.I know there are many others who feel the same and if you are one of these then put aside your feelings and give 'Pulp Fiction' a go. I only watched it because someone who knew my thoughts and this film kept on at me to see it. I am very glad he did.The violence is there but is far from excessive. What really is there is a great storyline with some good interwoven plot lines and many chuckles. Very well directed and acted. Enough to make for a very enjoyable 2-1/2 hours.So don't let 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Kill Bill' etc put you off. 'Pulp Fiction' is a damn good movie well worth seeing."
07/06/2022,9,"I've always been a fan of the proclaimed 'cult classics', as a teen, i find enjoyment through immersing myself within the ream of older film, which have been nurtured with perpetual praise for their sheer brilliance. This Quintin tarentino film falls nothing short of this belief, it is smart, acutely enjoyable and fun. Despite some gruesome violent scenes and it's ability to drag out long dialog, these minor inefficiencies cannot weigh down the amazing entirety of the film. I found myself empathetic with the persona's (especially Bruce Willis) with their ability to magnify likability. This left me indulged and intrigued within the heavy tension of the intense action scenes, promoting my sustained attention as to what was going to happen next.The characters, plot, sometimes witty dialog (a common trait exerted by taranteno) and action scenes favorably complimented my amazement with this film. A nostalgic experience also elevates my praise for this movie, a great cinematic work of art. Therefore i give it 8 out of 10."
23/05/2022,3,"Eh. Its alright. Overrated, i really dont want to type 150 characters please dont make me why are yyou making me do this please stop oh god i dont want to do this i just want to checklist this off the account thing it told me to write a review please stop it."
20/05/2022,3,"for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film."
15/05/2022,3,"After Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino was asked to direct Men in Black, Speed and numerous other titles, however he refused all so he could concentrate on writing the masterpiece that has now become the daring, hilarious and beloved Pulp Fiction.
Pulp Fiction was originally planned to be three separate stories all written and directed by a different person. Tarantino got Roger Avery and Tony Scott on board but after a few months of writing Tarantino realised that he had to direct the full thing. He adopted novelistic techniques such as non-linear structure and intertwining narratives to craft the astounding story of two robbers, two gangsters, a gangster's wife and a boxer.
The film is a glorious ""F you"" to conventional storytelling, there is no plot but somehow it manages to pull you into a world of witty dialogue and horrible violence. There isn't a moment in this film when I fell bored, after each rewatch it always retains the same joy I had upon my first watch.
Not only is the film great in of itself but opens up a whole different world of cinema I had no idea existed. It's because of this film I discovered Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini, it's because of this film that I found the treasure trove of Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe adaptations which then led to me finding the cult classic Faster Pussycat...Kill Kill! This movie managed to have so many references, without every feeling contrived, that there's probably still some ones only known to Tarantino himself.
Although the directing is top-notch there is no doubt that writing is the star of the show, Tarantino manages to go off on tangents about burgers, feet and five dollar shakes without ever making a dull moment. Tarantino says the Sicilian speech in True Romance is the best of writing he has done, but for me every line of this film beats that speech.
Not only did this film have a profound impact on audiences, but it also greatly affected directors and writers at the time. Pulp Fiction did for 90's and 2000's what Easy Rider did for the 70's, stuck the middle finger up to ""normal"" films and decided to go in a completely opposite route. Pulp Fiction completely changed movies after that. Guy Ritchie came about,adopting the same intertwining story technique and the same sense of humour and we must not forget Amores Perros and 21 grams all amazing films influenced by Pulp Fiction.
The affect this film has had on the audience and film in general is why I value it as one of the greatest movies ever made (and is also why I watch once a month, I just can't help myself)."
15/05/2022,3,"This is one of my favourite movie! I love Quentin Tarantino and I love this awesome movie. Everything is perfect. Actors, story, scene, music... everything. Love it!"
11/05/2022,3,"If I may, let me note what a year 1994 was for film. This film. Shawshank. Gump. The Lion King. If someone came up to me and started ranting about how this was the best cinematic year ever, I'd actually listen to them for awhile before asking them why they are getting in my face. Of those films, this and Shawshank stand out, because they were not pre-established blockbusters. Gump and Lion King were expected to be pretty big, and just turned out bigger than anyone could possibly imagine. But these films were smaller, more personal projects. They are also quite different from each other in almost every other way; a notable one being that while Shawshank barely made back its budget at the box office, this film took off. Over the last couple weeks, with Steve Jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. But it can succeed: this film is a prime example of that.This is important not just if you're incurably a nut about these sort of things, like am I. It means that this is the first exposure a lot of people had with a Tarantino film. I bet a lot of people became fans for life at some random matinée screenings some cloudy Tuesdays. This is one of those films that I would have loved to be there at one of its early screenings. A lot of minds were opened those days.I hope I'm not overselling this film, but it is one of those films that is so great that it is nearly impossible to oversell, which is a positive for me, as I love my gushing descriptions, as you might be able to tell if you read my review of Mad Max: Fury Road.One thing that must be noted about this film is that it goes out of order, and not a semi-organized out of order like Memento. This does not make the film hard to follow- it is easier to follow than Memento, at any rate- but it does make you think on your feet. Sometimes, I think that this whole movie is a then-young Mr. Tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. And it is glorious. No film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one.The title describes this film so well. It's not based on the style of blockbuster films. This isn't Jaws or Indiana Jones. This is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. This is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the DMV just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. It's not trying to be one of those Great American Novels written by Fitzgerald or Steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an English class or when they feel particularly scholarly.Of course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. This film is. It's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. It represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. In the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. Yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. But they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade.Artistic exploration became the norm. And few did that more than Mr. Tarantino, particularly in this film. Yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. But they did not get it in the way that they expected. To once more go back to MM:FR, I'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen Die Hard and James Bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. Their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. This film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. It transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. It is pure artistry.I cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. Pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. It's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though I argue that a more artsy version of the Hunger Games series would be a better one. But that's just me.As you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of John Travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. The soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. Enough so that when I wrote the words Pulp Fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (Misirlou as covered by Dick Dale and the Daletones, in case you were wondering).Above all, when I watched this film, I felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark. It enraptures you in itself. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised that it took off like it did back then. But I'm not surprised that it's remembered today. It holds a unique place in society and is one of the definitive 90s films. Enjoy."
08/05/2022,3,"The first thing coming in my mind for what we call cinema is the story! Doesn't matter what is the story about but how you tell it to people which in this case, Quentin Tarantino knows how to tell his story in an amazing way and we definitely buying it! His masterpiece never been repeated by him again in any other movies he made but I can still make a cocktail for my self, turn my phone off and enjoy watching this movie all day along. As read one of these reviews, it is both joy and a trial to sit through. Screenplay, directing and the best part acting is just spectacular and make the film work."
03/05/2022,3,"Pulp Fiction is clever, funny, well acted, well directed, thought provoking and extremely entertaining. Best performance of Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta's careers as well as an amazing addition to Quentin Tarantino's Filmography. The film is darkly comedic and makes you laugh hysterically over moments that you would otherwise not find amusing. The dialogue is sharp and witty yet feels very realistic for most of the film (occasional monologues aside). The film can make characters seem like total bad-asses just by having them eat food (in this case a burger) and can make you sympathize and care about horrible people. The film is extremely entertaining with no scene feeling like it goes for too long and every moment serving a purpose in the overall narrative. It is widely inventive and there is a reason people give this movie so much praise. All fans of movies and general cinema goers need to give this film a watch at some point in their life."
02/05/2022,3,"Some films date due to technology, fashion or political message. This film has none of it, just a unique combination of scenes bringing the best out of the characters. Yes some scenes drag, Walkens cameo is overly long, the scenes between Bruce Willis and his girlfriend unnecessary to the plot, but everything is spot on from the soundtrack to the pacing to the directorial skill."
28/04/2022,5,"Quentin Tarantino is a storyteller. With ""Pulp Fiction"" he demonstrates some of his favorite story features, like portrayal of a violent subculture and a cast of colorful characters. As the film tells us at its start, the pulp fiction genre is characterized by the lurid-a word that can mean merely colorful or extremely sensational. His films often border on film noir, but unlike most noir, there is a pulpy depth of character development that comes from extended dialogue.Except for a brief detour into a seemingly unrelated sub-story, the film begins with Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two men on the way to an unknown assignation. As they drive along, they discuss continental differences in language and culture. They philosophize openly and reveal significant aspects of their life views. When the viewer eventually realizes the nature of their outing, there is incongruence between their casual demeanor and the significance of their errand.Tarantino serves up his characters with heaping slices of humanity that undercut the judgments one might make if he was not privy to their internal systems of logic and morality. He reminds us that the old actor's precept is true: all people/characters believe they are justified in their actions.Vincent and Jules are not the central characters throughout the film. The story meanders in a non-linear way and indulges in detours that appear to be unrelated, but Tarantino has his eye on the entire, relevant whole. Though he may indulge in flights of fancy simply for the fun of doing so, he has a cohesive vision. Those flights of fancy are some of the most enjoyable moments in the film, like the restaurant called Jack Rabbit Slim's, where Vincent spends some time with the wife (Uma Thurman) of his boss. It's a restaurant that anyone might want to visit, filled with entertaining design elements and colorful people.As in at least four other films before, Tarantino puts Travolta on a dance floor and capitalizes on his ability to deliver memorable, if not iconic, performances.Tarantino gives us dialogue that is richly quotable. No wonder so many fans enjoy his films.Tarantino is definitely an auteur. His artistic vision is as recognizable as Hitchcock's or Woody Allen's. ""Pulp Fiction"", for reasons I have mentioned, is like a primer on how to engage an audience and take them on a journey. This is a film classic that will, no doubt, inspire other writers and directors."
24/04/2022,5,"Normally, I wouldn't bother to contribute my thoughts on a movie made back in '94, but I'm doing so for two reasons: 1.) It is my favorite movie of all time (and like everyone that uses this database, I've seen quite a few) 2.) I just watched it again last night (on DVD for the first time), which motivated me to go to IMDB and read the reviews.  I was aghast to read some of the negative comments that this movie inspired in many contributors. The following is more for the naysayers than anyone else.For those that championed the opinion that it glamorized drug use and violence: well, this is an age-old argument that's been pretty much exhausted.  Summed up in the question: ""does art reflect reality or does reality reflect art?"", I believe that it's a two-way street, and Pulp Fiction, evil intentions or no, rides right down the middle.  It's a glimpse of a world that I dare say is alien to most of us, so who are you to question it's authenticity in regards to its use of drugs, violence, language, and a lax attitude towards them all.For those that complained about the pointless dialog that did nothing to promote the plot: have you never heard of character development?  A lot of the things that have been dismissed as pointless and wasteful can be attributed to educating the audience of the character's thoughts and attitudes.  The ""pointless"" conversation between Jules and Vincent about cheeseburgers illustrates that not only is Vincent a traveler (and drug user), but that the two have a good working relationship, share similar interests, and genuinely like each other.The ""pointless"" dialog between Butch and Fabienne regarding potbellies is an insight to their relationship.  That exchange yes is silly and contributes nothing to the plot itself, but those are the kinds of pointless conversations that are often shared between a couple.  It's almost a milepost as to the seriousness of their relationship that they can enjoy such a trivial exchange.And plot?  Well, as it's been stated many times: its redemption, stupid. Not only for Jules, but for Butch as well.  Anyone who doesn't see that doesn't really deserve to have their opinions read let alone considered with any modicum of seriousness.Regarding the non-linear editing: is there a real problem with that?  Did it really confuse people all that much?  Were you still trying to mentally arrange the scene sequence ten minutes after the credits ran, or like most of the people I saw it with, figured out the jumps rather quickly and enjoyed the diversion?  Did Tarantino do it simply for the sake of doing it in an effort to be hip and cool?  I think not.  I do believe it was done in order to have the film end on a high note.  The alternative, if he had stuck to a linear formula, would have been Fabienne and Butch riding off on Zed's chopper, and that would have been a bit disappointing.Acting: what's not to like?  Have you seen any of Travolta's movies prior to this?  Utter trash.  With this one performance, he erased dozens of regurgitated, forgetful roles of leading men in mass-produced romantic comedies and dramas.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance was simply unparalleled.  Bruce Willis, who is normally unimpressive, blew me away with his performance.  The scene in the hotel room when he goes nuts after not being able to find his watch was just a joy to watch.  Seeing him seething mad at his mate's packing incompetence, and his fighting back that emotion and trying to reflect the blame back on himself...well, just the facial expressions were priceless.Direction?  Are you serious?  The needle-through-the-chest scene is perhaps the best directed sequence I've ever had the pleasure to watch.  You WERE in that living room with them.  You felt the frenzy, you could smell the sweat and the bong water, and you were just as on-edge as Vincent when you realized the potentially bad things that could result from the incident. That intensity could not have been duplicated by anyone of mediocre or non-existent directing talent.  The choreography was in a word, perfect.And as far as hype, is concerned, how could such a gem of cinematography not be hyped?  In my own defense, I saw this movie THE DAY it was released (and many times since), only days after first watching Reservoir Dogs. Basically, I knew little of Tarantino, but I knew that Dogs was among the best movies I'd seen in a long time.  Although I had seen and enjoyed Natural Born Killers and True Romance prior to PF, I was at the time unaware that their origins were with Tarantino.Pulp Fiction deserves all of the hype and all of the praise that it spawned. If you haven't seen it yet, what in God's name are you waiting for?  If you saw it and didn't like it, what in God's name is wrong with you?  What part of the formula for a good movie is missing in Pulp Fiction?Kudos to those who have praised it, and thank you Quentin for upping the ante of quality movie making.  My apologies for the length."
23/04/2022,5,"Different perspectives part of the same Story, most genius plot structure especially for the 90's, I know I'm late by like 20 something years lol but I'm only 18 so this is something huge in film. I noticed Nolan used this same plot structure for 'Dunkirk' and it worked just fine after I watched it a couple of times. Perhaps Nolan was inspired by Tarantino's work? Dunkirk and Pulp Fiction are the only two films that I've seen so far that have used this method and its been executed so Professionally, Bravo to Tarantino and again like over 20 years later..."
21/04/2022,5,"My Rating : 9/10""We're gonna be like three little Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like? Come on Yolanda what's Fonzie like?""Listed as one of the greatest movies ever, Pulp Fiction is endlessly entertaining and can be re-watched again and again.Big Lebowski and Pulp Fiction are two movies which have this rare quality - you just put it on and voila you're sucked in!Thumbs Way Up!"
19/04/2022,5,"I first saw Pulp Fiction on a bootlegged copy on VHS while it was still in theatres, which was funny due to the fact it still had the segment where Mia Wallace ""interviews"" Vincent before their date on a video camera. How surprised I was to see it in a theatre and see the scene missing. Quentin tacked it onto ""collector's edition"" VHS copies later on.The reason I watched it on video first was that I was sure I'd hate it; instead, it's unique, funny, touching, profane, cringy (hello, zed!) and flat out a great ride all the way. This movie is Also Bruce Willis' BEST performance by far. Most people talk about Travolta who is wonderful, but Willis pulling off a truly sympathetic and likable character is amazing. Sam Jackson also pulls off a career best performance - not everyone could deliver those lines from the Bible and make them sound as menacing and convincing."
06/04/2022,6,"As this is one of my most favourite films of all time, my opinion will be completely bias. However nothing can compete to this masterpiece that Tarantino created. Drugs, Money, Guns and a couple of bad-ass 'motherfuckers'.Just the right amount of each to keep 99% of people entertained. What I love too is the serious dark humour infused into the chaos, it makes you question yourself if it is funny or not. But that is what makes it a Tarantino classic. If you haven't watched this film already it needs to go straight to your watch list. I first saw this when I was 13 and I watch it at least once a year. Maybe it isn't to EVERYONE's taste but if you ever find yourself with a couple hours free time. WATCH THIS..."
27/03/2022,3,"A simple film, yet so intricate at the same time. Tarantino's dialogue is absolutely genius. If you haven't watched this already you're doing something wrong with your life."
24/03/2022,3,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!"
20/03/2022,3,"I would not say I'm necessarily against quentin tarantino, but I do find him incredibly overrated, with not a single movie at 10 stars. Now this movie is definitely really unique, and for that reason it gets a 7, I don't think I'd ever seen something like pulp fiction done before pulp fiction and it almost feels like the typa movie ud see christopher nolan make.The script itself is fine I guess. It's nothing special. Samuel L Jackson hard carries. Out of the whole movie only him and the wolf felt like they were enjoyable characters. In my opinion John Travolta was last generations timothee chalamet, someone who gets a lot of love but isn't that great an actor and a lot of his line deliveries aren't great. Overall pretty overrated 7.8/10."
17/03/2022,2,"I think the genius of pulp fiction comes in its ability to take multiple unique stories and weave them together perfectly through unconventional means. It can be argued that the chapters of the film work independently, but when put in an ensemble, each one gives us a peak into a world that feels lived in and larger than what we're presented with, at the same time, Pulp Fiction still changes the audiences perspective of the world it takes place in with each subsequent chapter while still feeling like the world we were introduced to in the very first scene. The chapters are famously unchronological and I believe it's a testament to Quentin Tarantino's creative genius and skills as a writer that a lot of its potency and impact as a film can be accredited to its unconventional sequence. Its a film about perspective, at least that's what I took from it, and I appreciate how the only real ""point"" or ""message"" it has is precisely that anyone can come to a conclusion about it, much like the theories revolving around the contents of the briefcase that pushes the plot forward in the first place."
13/02/2022,8,"An entire rainbow of characters intertwined in a bubbly imaginative world of neo-noir. The film is great, it's edgy and daring. Composes of seven narrative sequences and three main story lines, titled as the best written film of all time by some renowned critics and it's hard to disagree.. Pulp fiction is set in the world of humour, violence and inflated realism. It's is reaking of popular culture references at most times in the context of the sub-culture and underground. Being highly stylized, direction both visual and emotional, makes this film truly memorable and unique. No wonder it was nominated for seven Oscars and was also awarded at 1994 Cannes.. Pulp fiction is composed of all the classic best. Great and lively performances by Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis to name but a few; Great choice of music tracks by Maria McKee, Neil Diamond, Baker Knight, Al Green, Al Jackson an Jr., Willie Mitchell. Simply impossible not to like.."
12/02/2022,8,"The outrageously funny dialogue of this movie is what really drives it. Quentin Tarantino writes some of the most entertaining dialogue there is to write between two characters. Despite its over two and a half hours long run-time, Pulp fiction does not drag in the slightest as it is basically multiple exhilarating movies rolled into one with an all-star cast that perfectly fits in Tarantino's zany universe. You actually are left wanting for more as the end credits begin to roll. Even after watching the movie more than a dozen times, I still can't remember what scene comes next. However, It's non-linear narrative structure isn't what makes Pulp Fiction a near masterpiece, its true strength comes from the excitingly fresh characters and the crazy events that take place in the film. And of course, the quirky-smart dialogue. The characters in the movie are always talking yet always so interesting. You never really think you'd enjoy a movie about the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits, it all just feels so random, yet it intertwines so brilliantly. I love it. Undoubtedly, one of the most quotable movies ever and most certainly my favourite movie of all time.So, Pulp Fiction, 10/10? Correctamundo."
31/01/2022,9,"This film is throughout an extremely entertaining, funny, and very well written. The dialogue in this movie is easily the best ever. Scenes of two people talking in this movie are better than any action scene they could have thrown at us with this movie. The characters are all extremely memorable. This film in my opinion without a doubt qualifies as one of the best films ever made, and definitely one of the most entertaining also. Acting from everyone is great, but you can't beat Jackson's ""And you'll know my name is the lord when I lay my vengeance upon thy."". This film is an entertaining film that is sure to please those who want to watch it, and many of those who don't.4 stars out of 4"
08/01/2022,9,From Start to end. I saw no flaws. Just a rollercoaster and a masterclass for upcoming directors and actors. This is the biggest cult classic phenomenon of the last generation. I want Quentin Tarantino to direct more movies man. This man's a legend.
07/01/2022,9,"Not only is this a great movie with a cool theme. It got the most perfect soundtrack, i grew up with it actually, my dad bought it when it came out and i've heard the songs from time to time, and now when i saw it recently it all came back to me. This movie got me one step closer for me to like Quentin Tarantinos work even more. The movie was so great and the actors also. Loved everything in it, the cars , the weapons, the theme itself actually. This movie is a classic that will never die, people will remember it in 100 years from now. And Quentin Tarantino will be remembered also. The movie was not to short and not to long in my opinion, but unfortunately it had some slow parts in it, which is why i didn't vote 10/10 on it."
05/01/2022,9,"Quentin Tarantino presents his masterpiece: interwoven tales of a washed-up boxer, some bodyguards to powerful crime kingpin, and others who cross their path on this fateful day. Featuring an all-star cast: John Travolta in his best role (relaunching his dead career), Sam Jackson in his defining role (still trying to outdo himself fourteen years later), Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and more. (Many of these being Tarantino regulars, who work well with his idiosyncratic style.) How do I review a film so many people have praised, including my hero Roger Ebert? I could be a detractor and say its a bad film, but I'd be lying. I love the story and how it all plays out. I still prefer Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", but this comes in a close second. (Sadly, I don't think he ever recovered after he became famous. Subsequent films -- ""Jackie Brown"", ""Kill Bill"" and ""Death Proof"" -- all have a certain charm to them, but are not close to being on the level of ""Dogs"" or ""Pulp"".) Although I've seen this movie, or at least bits of it, a dozen times, I think the most recent may be the most interesting. I watched it with a young woman who saw Bruce Willis and asked who he was. I said, ""Bruce Willis."" She asked who that was. I listed a few of his bigger films (""Die Hard"", ""Armageddon"", etc.) but she said she had not seen them. How a woman in her 20s does not know Bruce Willis or any of his movies is beyond me, but it got me wondering: would ""Pulp Fiction"" be a different film if I didn't recognize the majority of the actors? Walken, for example, appeals to me because he's Walken. Would his monologue be as good if delivered by someone else or by Walken when I didn't know him by name? Curious thought.If you haven't seen ""Pulp Fiction"", see it. Tarantino is a better writer than a director, but this film offers probably his best directing to date and some superb writing. He is very dialogue-intensive, which I think alienates some viewers (particularly in ""Death Proof""), but give him a fair shake. This film defined the 1990s and continues to be influential in film today. Pay attention and you'll be sure to see why."
01/01/2022,8,"Yes, I admired the unique narrative of Pulp Fiction, and yes it was entertaining, but come on... you gotta bunch of people waving guns around in a wide open restaurant (including a black man who previously murdered 3 white men earlier in the day) with about 30 hostages for which seems to be about a half hour, and no cops show up?! And to add insult, this black man takes the time not only to recite a line from the Bible, but to also interpret what he feels this line means to him! It's obvious cops aren't in this movie because the criminals act as if they don't exist. I mean they really ACT AS IF COPS DON'T EXIST. And I thought Tarantino's repeated use of the N-word was low class, unfunny, uttered simply for shock value, and painfully obvious being that we knew he was going to have a black wife, didn't we? It's like someone diving into the water, but not wanting to get wet. Having said that, I enjoyed Pulp Fiction. But how could anyone think this flawed film deserved to win Best Picture. 2.5 stars."
30/12/2021,8,"""Pulp Fiction"" is hands down one of the coolest flicks I've ever laid eyes on. Tarantino's masterpiece is like a wild ride through the underbelly of LA, where every twist and turn keeps you hooked. The way the stories interweave, the slick dialogue, and the killer soundtrack all come together to create a vibe that's just so damn iconic. Plus, the characters? Total legends. Jules and Vincent are like the ultimate duo, dropping wisdom and one-liners like nobody's business. And let's not forget Mia Wallace, the epitome of badassery. Seriously, this flick is a must-watch for anyone craving a taste of cinematic genius with a side of edge. Trust me, you won't regret diving into the world of ""Pulp Fiction."""
25/12/2021,8,"This movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialogue, from the mordant '70s classicism of its long-take camera style and its smart, offbeat, strangely sexy cast."
20/12/2021,7,"Amazing movie. This should not be a good movie but it is. It's a simple story divided into 3 chapters, all occurring at different times in the story. Samuel L Jackson is so good in this movie. Bruce Willis is also great along with the rest of the cast. I was laughing the whole way through the movie. There were some great action sequences and intense moments."
18/12/2021,7,"I have watched 75% percent of this film twice: the first time, I watched it on TV, and about 3 quarters of the way, I gave up... However, due to the film's cult following, I gave it another shot (and watched it to the end) and, to be honest, I didn't like it anymore than I did the first time I watched it...Why is that?First of all, it was utterly chaotic for the most part. It felt like those experimental, amateur films, which I personally didn't like at all...Then there were the conversations within the film: as always with Tarantino's films, obscenely profane and crude, plus they get nowhere...Moreover, I found it over the top violent. Obviously, the storyline wouldn't be the same without all the violence, but at times I found it to be overdone on that department...Lastly, I found the script to be utterly appalling, in true Tarantino fashion, and nonsensical at parts...I only liked one thing about Pulp Fiction: the acting. Everyone did their best and in the end, wasn't the actors that disappointed me, but the film's script...So, the verdict:It might be that I dislike everything that involves Quentin Tarantino, (his signature obscene violence and cruelly long, pointless and crude conversations have always appalled me) but I cannot give this film more than a 3 out of 10. For me it was painful to watch, only to reach a disappointing ending. Utter loss of time! But then again, it seems I'm one of few here on IMDb that disliked Pulp Fiction..."
09/12/2021,8,"Tarantino, you genius! If you loved Reservoir Dogs, prepare to have a new favourite film! Quentin Tarantino blows us all away once again with 1994's ""Pulp Fiction"" with Oscar nominees Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Despite the scenes being in a mixed up time order, this is one every college student should have in their DVD collection. There are some scenes in which you can't help but laugh, even though a serious point in the film. I won't name any right now, because this is a SPOILER FREE REVIEW, PEOPLE! COME ON! But anyway, Pulp Fiction is sure to have you dying for more! The only thing I have wrong with this movie is Jules' Bible passage, which (despite being FRICKING BRILLIANT) does not appear in the Bible. But that doesn't matter, it's a brilliant film!"
08/12/2021,8,"Pulp Fiction.  The opening of this film consists of a literary definition of the title.  This alone should tell you what you are about to see cannot be compared to anything real.  But have you listened to the news or read the papers lately.  There's stuff going on the world that makes Pulp Fiction look like a day care center complete with cute bunnies.  Tarantino specializes in introducing us to characters, allowing us to get use to them, and he even getting us to like them.  Then all of a sudden he introduces an element that is so bizarre we barely have time to process it.  He doesn't give us time for it to sink in, but we still have to deal with this new direction while more stuff keeps happening.  The language, drug use, and violence are all incidental.  They are not ""Glorified"" by this movie.  If you make a movie about modern day gangsters in L.A. or any city, drugs and violence go hand in hand with it for it to be realistic in that respect.  I get the feeling Tarantino wants us to believe in the characters, dialogue, and overall initial premise.  Then he throws a monkey wrench into the works. How we react tells us a lot about ourselves. This is not my favorite movie ever, but it's definitely in my top 10.  I love the fact that there are as many people who love this movie as those who hate it.  That alone is a difficult achievement."
24/11/2021,10,"Possibly the greatest film of all time. A collage of images, stories and characters positioned in such a way that we tilt our heads in amazement trying to piece linearity to story arc. What we can take away is Tarantino's ability to revive a career (Travolta) and make one (Jackson) and still find a way to wrap a big kahuna burger into a tight foil. The soundtrack is also a clever collage, and so is each actor/actress handpicked and set neatly on the stage of a pulpy epic. And let's not forget about Willis, who, with his mademoiselle, adds another element to an already effective concept. After all, what's a gritty pulp crime story without its pugilist and his father's watch?"
19/09/2021,10,"Before watching ""Pulp Fiction"" I had no idea what it was about. My Mum had told me not to watch it, but as I was a typical 16 year old it made me want to watch it more. The first time I watched the film I was at school and it was too noisy to hear and follow the story as anyone will know due to it's non-linear narrative. I borrowed the film and watched it at home, again and again and again. I was hooked. After watching ""Pulp Fiction"" I bought ""Reservoir Dogs"" and was once again met with the feeling that this guy, the director is a genius. Since then I have seen ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Four Rooms"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". I have unfortunately not yet got round to seeing ""True Romance"" or ""Jackie Brown"" but believe me they will be worth the wait I'm sure.Returning to ""Pulp Fiction"" I can without a doubt say that this is my favourite movie in the whole world, although every film by Quentin Tarantino is to me breathe taking in some way, the cast, stories, direction and overall look of a film, to me make it the best of his work and anyone else's. John Travolta is a winning star in my eyes and when paired with the stunning cool of Samuel L. Jackson, the die hard persona that is Bruce Willis, the over powering presence of Ving Rhames and other cast members such as Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken and Tim Roth to name a few all add to the fascinating insight into life as a gangster. The dialogue is quick witted, cool and intelligent yet is so powerful with extracts from the bible placed perfectly in order to change murder into a scene as close to beauty as such a scene can be.I would recommend for anyone who has even a half a brain cell to see this film, even if it is just so they turn around and say ""I don't like it"" it is the sort of film that will eat away at you until you finally admit that there is something within it that you love. SEE THIS FILM, it's your lose if you don't."
28/07/2021,9,"This movie, despite the fact that I have now seen it more than 20 times, never gets old and certainly never fails to impress. The actors show just how talented they are and how much they are capable of. The scenes might seem to not make sense in the order they are in during the first time you watch it, but I assure you that after a second or maybe even third time everything will fall into place and amaze you. This movie basically has no flaws and demonstrates how amazing the art of cinematography can be.Many people underestimate the skill and class it takes to create such a movie but it is blindingly obvious that this film belongs in the top 100 best movies of all time in everyone's mind.This is my opinion on the film, it might seem overrated to you because i am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, but this movie left my mouth wide open and i cannot do otherwise but recommend it."
25/07/2021,9,"It's hard to put in words how much I love this movie, but here it goes. Pulp Fiction is an absolute masterpiece. A story that's told in non-linear fashion and keeps you guessing what will happen next...even if you've viewed it before. It's so amazing that it's nearly flawless!Where to begin, where to begin. The dialog is interesting yet realistic. Rather than giving us frequent exposition, which most filmmakers suffer from, Tarantino has found a way for his memorable characters to discuss pointless things that are fascinating to listen to while developing strong character traits. The movie's time-line is complex but to summarize it in one sentence, it shifts around both forward and backwards between sequences. The direction is sure-handed and Tarantino isn't afraid to hold a shot that flows smoothly with the way its edited. The casting is first-rate, this is the movie that helped revive John Travolta's career and made the rest of the actors' reputable to the Hollywood system.For those who are concerned about the level of violence, it's actually not as graphic as it seems. Yes, it's intense but if you look closely, the content of it isn't gratuitous or repulsive. Gene Siskel touched upon this in one of his reviews with Roger Ebert. For example, Bruce Willis swipes a man with a samurai sword. The victim is faced away from the camera so you don't see the weapon attack him. Then, when Willis stabs the sword into the guy's knee, it's out of frame and we only hear the sound effect & see his reaction.Don't worry, I'm wrapping this up. If you can surpass the hype and enjoy it for what it is, you are going to have a fun two hours. Hope you see it after reading this and enjoy your tasty burger!"
21/07/2021,9,"Tarantino creo lo que posiblemente es el inicio para aquellos que nos interesa el cine que va mas allá de lo comercial. Adoro esta película por ser de las primeras que he visto de manera seria en mi vida, y por la maravillosa creación de personaje que hay en ella."
13/07/2021,9,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a cult classic that revolutionized the crime genre. Released in 1994, the film is a neo-noir masterpiece with a complex, interwoven narrative, sharp dialogue, and unforgettable characters.Tarantino's signature style is on full display in Pulp Fiction, with its non-linear storytelling, graphic violence, and dark humor. The film follows several Los Angeles criminals whose lives intertwine in unexpected ways. Hitmen Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) navigate the city's underworld, while boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is tempted to double-cross his mob boss.Pulp Fiction is a film that rewards multiple viewings. With its intricate plot and clever dialogue, there's always something new to discover. The film's soundtrack is also iconic, featuring a mix of surf rock, soul, and pop that perfectly captures the film's atmosphere.Whether you're a fan of crime movies, independent cinema, or simply great storytelling, Pulp Fiction is a must-see. It's a wild ride that will stay with you long after the credits roll."
11/07/2021,9,"The American neo-noir black comedy crime film Pulp Fiction is directed and written by Quentin Tarantino and produced by Roger Avary.Pulp Fiction is a classic of modern American cinema, and its influence still can be felt today. The nonlinear narrative structure, clever use of dialogue, and memorable characters all make for a unique and engaging viewing experience. Travolta and Jackson deliver standout performances as hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, and Thurman is unforgettable as Mia Wallace, the drug-addled wife of gangster Marcellus Wallace (Rhames).One of Pulp Fiction's most unique elements is its music, which perfectly complements the action on screen. The film's eclectic soundtrack ranges from surf rock to soul, and each song is selected carefully to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the scene it accompanies.Overall, Pulp Fiction is a must-see for any fan of the film. It's a clever, stylish, and entertaining movie that has stood the test of time and remains a cultural touchstone."
29/06/2021,9,"Pulp Fiction is one of those brilliant type of films that you truly discover more and more each time you watch it. Like a kid in a candy store, there are more treats than one can handle in a single viewing. This is evidenced by the recent string of posts on the Pulp Fiction board entitled ""500 Things You've Noticed About Pulp Fiction."" Not too many movies have so many things going for it.This is truly a movie that defined a generation. After Pulp, a string of films came out that attempted to recapture the magic of Pulp: 2 Days in the Valley, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Go., and many more. Each of these movies had something going for it; but each movie seemed to only bring to the table one of the many elements that made pulp so rich, whether it be the non-linear storytelling, witty dialogue with pop-culture reference, hipper-than-thou characters, or absurd, out-of-nowhere plot twists. Pulp, however, had the whole package in one movie."
14/06/2021,9,"This movie has forever changed the face of film-making. Never had a movie with so many seedy, unlikable characters gained such wide praise, without having any glamorous drama or action. The movie is about as real as it gets. I have read many criticisms outlining the lack of meaning in the dialogue. To me thats the genius of it. This is everyday s**t that any two people in a car or restaurant are discussing. How many people sit in a diner or any other business talking about what it would be like to rob the place? How many guys talk about foot massages? Mia Wallace is top of the line on meaningless conversation, especially in her deleted scenes with Vincent getting his interview.The movie winds together beautifully, and I love the fact that most of the morons I know dismiss it merely on its lack of continuity. It rightfully deserves its praise. If you judge it on nothing else, judge it on its entertainment value. I can watch this film 50 times in 50 days, its that much fun"
18/05/2021,2,"Pulp fiction is one of the best crime/ dramatic movie of my time. The movie had such a great cast, and some intense dramatic scene pretty much through the whole movie. I remember not liking this movie when I was a kid, but now that I am older I really enjoy watching this film. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie but the most memorable scene I think was when Uma Thurman and John Travolta are dancing on stage at the restaurant to "" You never can tell"" by Chuck Berry. Another famous and great scene is Samuel L Jacksons speech hes giving to the guy while shooting every one else. A lot of action shots in this film, drugs, guns, and violence. A very brilliantly shot film."
17/05/2021,2,"It may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'Pulp Fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. Yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, I would imagine - stand the test of time. But is it for everyone?It's Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and I'd agree). However, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? I guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. It's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. Confused? Stick with it. It's worth it.If you check out the main poster associated with 'Pulp Fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of Uma Thurman's character to sell it. Even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and - of course - Samuel L Jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). This is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. However, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance.'Pulp Fiction' has made it's mark on not only the Box Office and takings, but also on popular culture. It's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in.Due to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. And it's all the better for it. This is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. For all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. You can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your Instagram account on your phone. You really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. Because of that it's not for idle viewers. It's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!).If you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'Pulp Fiction' a little hard to watch. However, even if you're not sure about it, I would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. Plus, as I've eluded to, Samuel L Jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. They don't make them like this any more. Even Tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here."
17/05/2021,2,"You cannot resist watching a movie with Uma Thurman, Samuel Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken, plus you definitely cannot resist watching a movie directed and part written by Quentin Tarantino. So, nuff said, one of the all time iconic must see movies."
07/05/2021,2,"This movie is amazing. I love Tarantino. I love violence. I love this movie. This movie is so freaking good that i could talk about it for hours. It was not the first Tarantino movie i saw, nor the 2nd,3rd, or 4th but it should have been. I now know why this movie is so well known. The cinematography is awesome and the whole look of the film in general is an experience to see. The really cool thing about this movie is that its shot out of chronological order. The scenes are completely all over the place. They do not go in order. Its different and could confuse you but i was still able to pick up on the movie and what was going on because all though none of the scenes were shot in order they all connect to each other a little bit in a way. I think that the way its shot out of chronological order makes the movie awesome and unique. I've seen a number of movies shot out of chronological order but this one is the best in my opinion. Im not lying when i say everything about this movie is a freaking trip! Its got an insanely good cast starring in it and it has a lot of violence. Love this movie. Tarantino never disappoints me."
05/05/2021,2,"This is the movie which has one of the most briliant Hungarian dub - which of coruse does not give back everything perfectly, but... just briliant, the original and the hugnarian dub as well."
14/04/2021,4,"From what I gather, and my own reaction, people either love this movie or hate it. Strangely, I have been on both sides of the fence with this film. I never look at it in the same light, for some reason. At first I hated it and on a second chance, really liked it. Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.This is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?Two things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest. With 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all."
09/04/2021,6,"Pulp Fiction is a terrific movie! It has all the characteristics of a perfect movie: engaging plot, memorable characters, excellent writing and directing, and awesome music! Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best film-makers of all time. I love all of his movies and I never get tired of watching any of them! Pulp Fiction is just another example of how awesome Tarantino is as a film-maker.Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that requires a second viewing or more to truly understand it and enjoy it more. Not only does it get better with each viewing but it also becomes easier to understand as you notice how Tarantino focuses on the small details of the film and how the small details relate to the main plot. For example: the connection between Marsellus Wallace's Band-Aid on his neck and the suitcase.There is a fan theory that says that Marsellus sold his soul to the devil and his soul is inside the suitcase. The fan theory states that in order the extract a soul, it has to come from the back of the neck thus explaining the Band-Aid on Wallace's neck. Tarantino has not come out and proved that theory true or not. Personally, I think Tarantino ultimately led the guessing to the fans as they come up with possible outcomes. The acting and dialogue is over the top and straight forward and I couldn't have possibly thought of a better cast to play the characters.When the film was nominated for all of those Academy Awards in '94, there was very tough competition since other films like Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption were also nominated. But I won't complain since those 2 movies are really good too. However, I believe Pulp Fiction deserved the Oscar for Best Original Script and I'm really glad it won! In conclusion, Pulp Fiction is a cinematic masterpiece that will forever be a highly significant film even after all these years."
24/03/2021,2,"This is indeed the best movie I have ever seen. I don't know how people actually hate it. It's a totally original movie, its got everything from violence to extreme profanity. this in my opinion gets a 10/10 for sure."
19/03/2021,2,"This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB."
13/03/2021,2,"The movie is a classic, without a doubt. Its very entertaining and features fantastic acting and writing. The movie however, does not have the most powerful meaning its more something that you watch for fun. I must also admit that Quentin Tarantino's style is not my cup of tea. However, I still have to respect the ingenuity of which this film has been made."
11/03/2021,2,"""What a unwasted long movie, terrific perfomance by all of the cast including Mr. Tarantino himself i think he is a great actor here, the story no doubt it's brilliant, and of course i will never stop writing this but the music that Tarantino choose is always perfect, i really enjoyed this, don't worry about the duration just enjoyed the whole story, Pulp Fiction is a movie that no matter how many you watch this movie even till like a thousand times it will always and forever be good, i highly recommended"""
11/03/2021,2,"I must average viewing this flick around six times per year. Every two months -- yeah, that sounds about right. Are there really any other films out there with legendary scene after legendary scene after legendary scene? Maybe, but not on the same scale as Pulp Fiction.Who hasn't seen this already? I mean, really? Do these people exist?WATCH THIS FILM!THEN WATCH IT AGAIN!AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN!YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH!"
08/03/2021,2,From the moment the movie starts it is captivating. with its non-linear story structure allows you to jump into your favorite scene and or watch the scenes in the order in which you feel is best.
07/03/2021,2,"While smoking, sex, nudity, violence, frightning/intense scenes are a main theme in Pulp Fiction, but it is good. Why? I have not seen the movie, but yet again I will know it will be awesome! A must-watch and recommendation!!!"
04/03/2021,2,"It is a good movie, Action packed and interesting use of time. If you like Fight Club you will like Pulp fiction. I found the acting to be well done with an amazing performance from Samuel L. Jackson, and John Travolta. This movie can be comic and sad at the same time and contains very many different view points about how life works. I found that this movie is not at all rated for children and should be avoided by those who are easily offended or have weak stomachs. Drug use is prevalent in this movie. I am very pleased with the overall final result, great flick. I recently had to pick my top five movies of all time that I enjoyed and this made the list, following Fight Club and many great films to the same strength and fortitude."
23/02/2021,8,"""Pulp Fiction"" is an absolute masterpiece that revolutionized the crime genre. With its non-linear storytelling and unforgettable characters, Quentin Tarantino crafts a cinematic experience like no other. The film oozes with style, from the iconic dialogue to the killer soundtrack. The performances by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman are nothing short of brilliant. The dark humor and unexpected twists keep you on the edge of your seat. Tarantino's expert direction and attention to detail make every scene a work of art. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a wild ride filled with violence, wit, and memorable moments. It's a must-watch for any film lover looking for a bold and unconventional masterpiece. 🎥🔫✨"
22/02/2021,8,talk about a Lousy movie.. this one was Ridiulous !! i couldnt understand it at All .. i only watched half of it.. [the part with Bruce Willis] and soon as that was over i re-wound it .. talk about a waste of good money..and why would all the actors in this movie want to be associated with such junk ?? what were they thinking ??? it sure confused the heck out of me thats for sure.. i cant see what the big deal was with this sorry excuse for a movie.. it is a waste of film and a waste of the actors times as i see it... i would advise someone not to use their hard earned money on this drivel.. rent something else instead of this turkey !!
21/02/2021,8,"At the beginning of the film, right before it starts, there is a definition of the two words that make up the title of this film. One word that should have been defined is the word classic. If you ask me what my definition of a classic film is, it is one that is easily remembered, whether that be by memorable quotes, characters or scenery and thoroughly enjoyable to the point where you will want to see it on a regular basis. I could go on and on about all of that but I will say this is one film that has changed the way I see films. It has become one of my all time favourites as a result. As soon as I started watching it the first time, I knew this was something special. I cannot even tell you how many times I have watched it but I always remember the witty dialogue, the violence, characters, etc. Even thought it is officially defined as a crime/drama film, I can't help but find a few of the scenes as side splitting hilarious. I see perfection as a bit of a myth but to me, Pulp Fiction is as close as it comes to a perfect film. The casting of the roles is very good, in particular, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman, script writing is fantastic, not just because of the witty dialogue but due to Quentin Tarantino being brave by telling this story in a non-traditional, non-linear fashion. Kudos also to Tarantino's direction, showing why he is one of the best modern Hollywood directors out there. Speaking of kudos, I think Pulp Fiction's legacy has grown since being released in 1994 and should have won at least two more Academy Awards, namely Samuel L. Jackson as Best Supporting Actor and Quentin Tarantino as Best Director. Nevertheless, it has truly stood the test of time and is one of the best of the 1990's and of all time as well."
18/02/2021,8,"This is most definitely one of Tarantinos best movies ever! It's a movie weaving together a bunch of stories and how they overlap, and what role destiny may play... It offers a bit more smiles than the average Tarantino movie. Basically it's a smart, and unpredictable movie, and you will appreciate it more with every time you see it! And believe me, you WILL see it several times! The cast is spot on, and the soundtrack is, wow! It is, as always with Tarantino, a bit odd, dark and complicated, but with just a tad of humor making it really cool and heavy, and adding that extra dimension to the movie! Overall it's a one of a kind movie, and already a classic, one of those you just have to have seen!"
17/02/2021,8,"This film is great for a number of reasons. The soundtrack is one reason because it's full of classic rock songs that really fit the mood of the scenes in which they appear in. Tarantino does an excellent job at providing non diegetic sound to capture the feel of each scene. The acting is also great in this film. Samuel L Jackson is very scary yet hilarious and you really believe he is the character in real life. The quick cuts and different camera angles Tarantino uses in this film add to the mood of the film. The quick cuts help tell the audience that this is a fast and exciting movie. Overall, i loved this movie and recommend it to anyone and everyone."
13/02/2021,8,"The masterpiece of the non-linear narrative film. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, with wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has beautiful qualities, but they are hopelessly going to darkness and confusion. Each paragraph has no beginning and end, a complementary structure, and the beginning and end are connected, suggesting that the plots in similar movies in reality always happen and never stop.
Line: Why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find a truly special person can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence."
09/02/2021,8,"The movie has its own spirit. The realistic rude behavior every actor pulls in the films makes the movie complete.Warning! Warning! This may destroy some of the experience if you haven´t seen the movie yet. If you already have seen it, check this out! The briefcase Vincent and Jules are going to pick up over at Brad´s place. You know there with the Big Kahuna Burger. The briefcase has a code lock. The code is 666. I don´t know if Tarantino is christian or satanist, but take it as a symbol. Every time somebody sees the content of the briefcase they go, wow! Their eyes are glowing with greed. It´s the temptation. Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) is the devil. Trying to buy Butch Cooligde´s (Bruce Willis) soul or just trying to get him to take a dive in the fight. Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the good man. Sees the shoot-up mistake in Brads place as ""divine influence"". Switch some of the letters in Jules and you get ""Jesul"", close to another name. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the bad man. He denies that there is such power controlling the universe in the ways Jules thinks. Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) is just another human satan uses to tease Vega. Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel) is the demon that frightens the good man. Do you see the posibility, as Jules, or is it just coincedences, as a true Vincent?  Now see the movie again and think of the posibility and make up your point with the movie!"
09/02/2021,8,i don't why people had ranked this movie so high but there is nothing in this movie which is good expect john and Jackman Samuels acting.................this is slowest movie i have ever seen the parts like start with boss wife is not needed..................... when i have seen rating of this movie i was really exited to see it i bought the movie CD when i stated watching movie is good at start it attracts mine interest but after the two stories the third seems much boring and after that the others are also boring and does not make any sense i thought that there will be any suspense in the last part but what i thought was crap so movie is much much below mine expectations.......
04/02/2021,8,I thought the reels were in the wrong order.How anyone would think this weird disaster had any redeeming qualities at all is beyond me.Where's the story line?  Is there any continuity to the plot?  What's the point?
03/02/2021,8,"This is a great example of what happens when you let an artist do their thing.Every frame, every line, every second is a joy to view. The synchronicity is masterful.Lightning, in a bottle."
02/02/2021,8,"Pulp Fiction is an American movie released in 1994 and one of the most impressive films of the 90´s. It´s Quentin Tarantino´s masterpiece and is
categorized as police/suspense. It lasts 1h54 and has the age rating of 18. It was produced by Lawrence Bender and Tarantino himself and the story was written by Tarantino and Roger Avary. Pulp Fiction had a budget of 8 million dollars.
Pulp Fiction was the movie that released Tarantino to the stardom:
Tarantino being the director, screenwriter, producer and actor all together. He was born on March 27, 1963, USA and he achieved fame in the early 90's for his nonlinear scripts.
He loves to use graphic violence, rich dialogues - with a mix of irony and humor - and violence. Pulp Fiction´s main characteristic is the nonlinear narrative,
feature followed by the Brazilian film director Fernando Meirelles in Cidade de Deus. It is a vanguard movie, using and abusing of camera techniques and encompassing movie tricks. It´s a masterpiece that collects high class actors like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackon, Bruce Willis and, Tarantino´s darling, Uma Thurman. The four independent stories, but brilliantly connected by a unique theme of violence, are all magnificent,
bringing up the discussion of violence and moral values. It made Tarantino win the Oscar of best original script besides the Golden Palm in Cannes. The soundtrack - lights on You Never Can Tell by guitar legend Chuck Berry - amplifies the film's immersion into an amazing and nostalgic atmosphere. Pulp Fiction, despite its extreme violence, is a delight to our eyes and ears. So, I dare you! I double dare you to watch the movie!"
31/01/2021,9,"Its not my all time favorite film, but man this is am awesome film for sure. Let's start off with the best thing about this film, the writing. The writing is fantastically well done. Every character has a unique style and it makes them all a whole lot more memorable. The comedy is on point, each bit of comedy is done perfectly hilariously. The action although not a lot is great. Its very bloody and over the top. The basic violence of Tarantino and it is awesomely brutal. The set's are done perfectly too. The 50s diner is amazing to look at. The entire film is done with such a unique style to any film I have ever seen. Overall its a must watch film and I highly recommend this film to everyone who hasn't seen it."
25/01/2021,8,"Now, what can I say about ""Pulp Fiction""? You've all heard of it and may be wondering what all the hype is about. I won't delve into all the details in this review so the best I can do (without spoiling the movie) is to just explain some of the things that were great about it. A noticeable quality about ""Pulp Fiction"" that really struck me (and part of what made it so great)was the dialogue. The dialogue dwells on seemingly pointless subjects, such as what a quarter pounder with cheese is called in France, yet is so encapsulating. 80% of the film is dialogue and surprisingly, it is consistently kept interesting. Whereas in most movies, the dialogue seems to jump around and pass away as the story moves along, the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction"" sets itself up to be played out in future situations(You'll see what I mean) and in this way, Tarantino is able to create many instances of irony and maintain a solid story. In an interview Quentin Tarantino discussed the nonlinear script and explained that if writers can use this format in their books and have such freedom in their storytelling, why couldn't he? How right he is. Tarantino started nothing short of a revolution in the film world by doing so. With the 5 different mini-""stories"" in the film(Jules and Vincent, Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega, the Bonnie Situation, the Diner, and the Golden Watch) Tarantino unravels each of the characters' stories and shows the viewer what happens after and before what appear to be cliché situations. The result is something the likes of which you have never seen before. And not only that, Tarantino was able to intertwine all of the different stories and bring them together into a unified theme, ending with an iconic scene that will leave you speechless. At this point, I must address the complaints of many people who think that ""Pulp Fiction"" is merely a flick that revels in drug use, language, and violence. On the contrary, ""Pulp Fiction"" is essentially a moral story with a strong theme of redemption yet it is told through ""immoral"" characters(hit men, robbers, mob bosses, etc.). Think of all of the great literary pieces in history that were banned and condemned for their immorality but are praised for their genius today! Of course, there's nothing wrong with a good Disney movie for family fun and moral values, but Tarantino's style provides a breath of fresh air to the cinematic community. Not to mention all of the other motifs, plot devices, and iconic scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" is abundant with thrills, chills, and laughs. There is nothing more I can do except to say, get off your butt, go to blockbuster and rent it. ""You won't know the facts until you know the fiction""."
23/01/2021,8,"Most movies, like most novels and musical compositions, have a beginning, a middle, and an end. But a gifted, creative director/writer such as Quentin Tarantino can convolute time and come out with a new kind of animal. And look what James Joyce and the stream of consciousness writers such as William Faulkner did with time in their works. Another great movie ""Momentum"" did it all backwards, starting at the end and ending at the beginning and it worked like magic. When I first rented ""Pulp Fiction"" when it was first released on VHS I watched it late at night and fell asleep right after the Jack Rabbit Slim sequence. When I awoke the story was back on the hit scene with Vincent and Jules still talking about quarter pounders and Big Macs. I thought the tape had rewound itself and so turned off the player. I didn't finish the movie until a few months later. Then I realized Tarantino was merely playing with time. In lesser hands ""Pulp Fiction"" would be too episodic, but Tarantino makes it all work. In the end we have a happy closing knowing that tragedy lies ahead because we have already seen that part in the middle.Vincent and Jules have to be the most garrulous hit men ever to appear in the cinema. They are debating the difference between oral sex and giving a lady a foot massage on their way to a kill. Jules, the spiritually misguided soul, continues to rattle on until eventually told to shut up when they arrive at the cleaners. With Tarantino at the controls all this seems to fit in when the final play is made. This element could have easily degenerated into prattle.Although there are many other levels of interpretation, I see this film as mainly a farce filled with dark humor and pathos, not just a farce on gangster movies in general but on our brave new world, centered on urban decay, corruption, exploitation, and perversion, filled with raw sex, drugs, and violence. The relationship between Butch and his woman points to another direction of love, compassion, and fulfillment. Note also that Butch goes back to help the man who was out to kill him because his morals wouldn't let him leave Marsellus to the rapists just as they wouldn't let him throw a fight. The watch is symbolic of eternal values that rise above the glitter and garishness of the ephemeral. Going back for the watch could have cost Butch his life but it and the values it represents were more important to him. In the end these values win out. Even Vincent has moments of compassion and tenderness, especially when with Mia. Jules almost goes full circle, but the viewer is left with a feeling that he is not totally sincere in his awakening following his brief encounter with death. Butch and his woman seem to be the only two who are able to get completely free from sin city.Each decade has movies that define the era. Think of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" for the 1950's or ""Casablanca"" for the 1940's. For me ""Pulp Fiction"" defines the 90's. All the things that were wrong for America are touched on by Tarantino, yet he provides the means of escape to what America should be. The world of the 90's was almost like a cheap book, or a book of pulp fiction as such a work was called once upon a time, showing the underbelly of urban life but with a way out. There is an exit. Sartre's ""No Exit"" doesn't work here. Redemption is possible, hopefully a more lasting redemption than the one Jules claims to have discovered. All he really has is a suitcase with contents that glitter when opened. Butch has the watch with eternal values.Tarantino wisely uses surf music from the 60's to highlight the gritty life of beach bums, now street bums, who think of themselves as warlords and urban supermen...but, hey, it's all pulp fiction in the end."
16/01/2021,8,"I was very impressed with Pulp Fiction, upon seeing it for the first time recently. Right down to the nitty gritty: Pulp Fiction specializes in sharp and darkly humorous dialog which builds up almost unbearable suspense, culminating in sudden violence. In particular, Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta provide a nearly endless supply of memorable quotes (most of which can't be repeated in polite company). The plot itself is rather fragmented, but fairly easy to follow. The violence can be brutal (in particular, one headshot results in a bloody mess all over a car's back window), but is much more toned down than in Kill Bill, and is relatively infrequent. Unfortunately, the movie whole-heartedly embraces some things that viewers might find offensive. Male Rape makes a brief appearance, as well as an implied torture (which we never see), explicit drug use, and an F-bomb count that I swear exceeds the total number of minutes in the movie.In the end, though, Pulp Fiction ends on a positive note, and doesn't leave you feeling unhappy and dirty. It's a thrill ride from beginning to end, and a brilliant one at that."
13/01/2021,8,"What is Pulp Fiction about? On the surface, it is about several unique people and how their lives connect in some way. The cast of characters includes a boxer (Bruce Willis), two gangsters (John Travolta), their boss (Ving Rhames), and his wife (Uma Thurman). The whole movie consists of several small stories that all connect to each other. One of them involves the two gangsters trying to get rid of a dead body and clean up the mess they've made. Another situation has Travolta taking his boss' wife out on a date, her overdosing on cocaine, and him trying to find a way to save her life. There are other story lines that I won't give away because part of the fun is seeing how everything comes together. But the story is not told in chronological order. It jumps back and forth between stories in a way that would normally be confusing, but the brilliant screenplay makes everything flow nice and smooth.If you like to look at movies for their meaning and artistic value, then you could say that Pulp Fiction is about how people have lost all meaning and value in their lives. Instead of having individuality, people define themselves by what they see in pop culture. The movie has endless references to pop culture and it seems that everything in the movie is inspired by some aspect of pop culture. This is not a lack of originality, but a way to show that everything we do is inspired by something or somebody else. A perfect example is when Bruce Willis' character, Butch, is talking to a Hispanic cab driver who asks him the meaning of his name. He says, ""This is America, honey, our names don't mean sh*t."" To me, the meaning of Pulp Fiction is that each moment has its own priorities. Something might be important to you at one moment in time, but in another not important at all. One minute you could be racking your brain over what you are going to say in your next Facebook status update, and the next you could have a gun in your face. People think they know what is important to them until something else happens that completely changes their priorities. Take, for example, the part where Butch Coolidge sees the man who wants him dead. At one point, they are trying to kill each other, and suddenly one is trying to save the other from getting raped by some psychos in a gun shop. When it is all said and done, they don't even care about why they were fighting in the first place because something bigger and more important is happening.One of the things that makes Pulp Fiction great is that if you don't want to think too much about the deep, philosophical meaning to it, then you can just enjoy the movie for what it is-a humorous, violent, and stylish portrayal of several characters and their encounters with one another. It has a little something for everyone, and the more times you watch it, the more you begin to understand and appreciate it.The genius of the movie comes out in its dialogue. Everything the characters say has meaning or it foreshadows something that is going to happen. For example, when Travolta and Jackson are talking, Travolta says that in France, a quarter pounder with cheese is called a ""royale with cheese."" Soon after, when they are about to do a hit on a few college kids, Jackson asks one of them about the hamburger he is eating. He then uses the ""royale with cheese"" line on him, which leads to one of the funniest conversations in the history of movies.The Academy-Award nominated performance by Samuel L. Jackson creates one of the coolest, funniest, and greatest characters ever. Despite how crazy the whole movie is (and how ridiculous his hair is), we never get the feeling that he is acting. He makes us think that he is a real person and truly believes everything he says. It is very exhilarating to watch how he starts off as a mob hit man with little meaning in his life and transforms into a deeper, more self-aware person.Pulp Fiction is not only the best movie of the '90s, but it is one of the greatest films of all time. Whether you like hilarious comedies, violent action thrillers, or a deeply absorbing drama-you can enjoy it. The first time you watch it, don't try and think too much about it; just watch how the plot unfolds and everything comes together. Watch the funny conversations between Travolta and Jackson, the funky dance scene with Travolta and Thurman, and all of the other moments that make Pulp Fiction a truly memorable movie.http://franklinreviews.blogspot.com/"
13/01/2021,8,"I'm not sure why, but I really loved this film. There is no reason, I just loved it. My sister told me that if I liked ""Kill Bill"" than I should enjoy ""Pulp Fiction"". I noticed that it was also #16 on the top 250. How could I say no to that? I am not a huge Quentin Tarentino fan, to let everyone know. I know there is a huge die hard fans who can't stand if he is bad rapped. I am not one of those people. But! I do think the man has talent that people reconize almost immidatley. All of his films are on the top 250 if you haven't noticed.
The film isn't for everyone. You have to be in a certain mood to watch it. It is pretty sick, so, it's not for everyone. But I would recommend if you love action flicks.10/10"
12/01/2021,8,"The draw for me for this movie was the interwoven storyline and the big name actors like Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman although I'm not a fan of Uma Thurman. No offense to her, she just doesn't draw me in like other actresses do.So it's about these two hit men who have to retrieve a stolen suitcase from some low level criminals. Those criminal's boss is a big level criminal who organizes for Bruce Willis's character Butch Coolidge to throw his next fight. That big level criminal gets one of his lackeys Vincent Vega played by John Travolta to take his wife Mia out dancing and the iconic ""fingers across the eyes in a peace sign"" dance was born.There are many other characters whose lives are interwoven into these characters and to me, that was the fun part, to see how that played out. It's has some famous people (at the time) in smaller roles.There's no real point to this story and it doesn't really have a beginning, or end. It just sort of starts and stops which is off putting to me and why I only gave it 6 stars. What kept me from going lower was the writing and the sort of outlandish characters and scenes that played out, almost at random throughout.While I liked this movie at the time, I don't think I would love it today if it were the first time I saw it. I would still watch it though for the nostalgia of it, but may not recommend it to anyone under 40."
09/01/2021,9,"This film is a classic and a must see for people who want a great plot, a great actor's list and a great movie!! Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken all play in this film brilliantly, with Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and many more playing their part. The Music is truly American and lines that the actors say is truly brilliant. Quentin Tarantino's Greatest film and maybe even the greatest movie of all time. The different story lines that cross make this film exciting and unpredictable. The Camera angles and trademarks of Quentin Tarantino are Great and I think maybe this movie could take over The Godfather one day. A masterpiece, and a must buy for a Complete Collection"

With its non-linear structure, unforgettable characters, and an infectious soundtrack, the film remains an enduring masterpiece that stands as a testament to the power of cinema."
04/01/2021,9,Unpopular opinion but Tarantino is not a cinema director. Every scene he writes is like a sitcom scene where characters argue like little Fonzies' over the dinner table. The movie is entertaining but can only maintain short bursts of plot before moving onto the next argument over a passed out gangster's wife. Travolta is of course Jerry whose comedy/heroin addiction sucks in the female lead Mia/Elaine. Jackson is Kramer with his whacked-out take on life and Willis is of course George who would sacrifice anything for his obsessions. If anyone could put a bullet in Jerry it would be George. My favourite bit is Samuel Jackson's revelatory speech to Tim Roth in the film's final episode. That and the fantastic premature freeze frame on Amanda Plummer that precedes the film's credits.

29/12/2020,8,There are some films that simply change the way we look at people. This is one of those films. Dynamic storytelling. Unapologetic grit. Swagger. This is the movie that inspired me to make films.
25/12/2020,8,"My first memory of Pulp Fiction was when I was very young, and my father had borrowed the soundtrack, and he listened to it. And I still remember listening to the beginning, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogue, followed by Misirlou. I don't have any idea why it had such an impact on me, but I remembered that for so long. And the soundtrack of this film continues to enchant me! There are so many songs in this film that are absolute gold. I already mentioned Misirlou, but one exceptionally beautiful track is Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon by Urge Overkill. I saw Pulp fiction for the first time three years ago. I was sixteen then. But this time I did notice there were several details I missed - or have since then forgotten. It's great how you can watch a film again and it still feels kind of new.I love the colour palette of Pulp Fiction. Especially the colour red is very strong. And I have no complaints about the cinematography whatsoever, it really looks amazing. And the design of many locations is great. I especially love Jack Rabbit Slims, the 50's themed restaurant Mia and Vincent Vega go to. It looks absolutely ridiculous of course, very extravagant, but that's why it's so amazing. It's so detailed.Pulp Fiction sure has it's cult classic reputation. I think almost everyone with Internet has seen pictures and GIFs of Pulp Fiction, even if they haven't seen the film itself. That's why watching the film is weirdly surreal. You know so many scenes, but when they are put together, they are perfect, even if so many scenes are legendary even on their own: Samuel L. Jackson's monologue, The dance scene. Several pieces of dialogue. They are all amazing and so many people know them, but when you see them all in a film, it's... surreal.The characters of Pulp Fiction never seize to amaze me. Like I said about Reservoir Dogs, the characters are closer to people than devices to carry out the story. None of them is a hero, none of them is a villain. They have virtues, they have vices. Of course they are devices for the story, that's what characters do, but even when they do their job for the plot, they still have lives outside of the story. Even if the film doesn't shove their regular life to your face, you can still feel it.Pulp Fiction is good. It is most definitely good, it's amazing. Of course I like to think sometimes that it is completely overrated, but whenever I watch it again - or even see an out-of-context piece of the film, I remember that it is one of the best films ever made."
25/12/2020,8,"This movie is a masterpiece on every level.All the references to McDonalds, the cereal that was discontinued, which Quentin has saved and put into the movie. It is all a piece of American culture. And coming from a guy from Europe, I simply love all that brand stuff. Following criminals in their daily lives, hearing their dialog - is wonderful and it makes for a lot of wit. It is bizarre contrast between murder and funny discussions.The acting. Well I think John Travolta was bad, even tho he got critical acclaim. But Samuel give the performance of his life.The drugs. I like that this movie didn't focus on sex. It feels so cheap. Instead, it depicts a housewife's cocaine use. Classy scenes of injecting top grade heroin. It is all very stylish and really makes the movie sexy, it didn't feel like a cheap trick.It is morbid humor, appealing to all of us mainstream moviegoers, as well as for respected critics."
23/12/2020,7,"This was one of THE best movies I have ever seen! My dad told me about this movie and at first I was reluctant to watch it because it looked old but after the first 10 minuets I was hooked! It does kinda get confusing sometimes but you will defiantly pick up all the parts and by the end of the movie you will understand everything There is a perfect balance of action which includes blood, shooting, and wicked gun fights! Comedy, because lets be honest Samuel Jackson is just down right hilarious. There is a lot of cursing but it fits perfectly with the scenes! I would totally recommend this to all of my friends. Couldn't think of a better way to spend a night then watching this movie! 10/10 would watch again!!"
21/12/2020,7,"Quentin Tarantino knows how to direct an absorbing story and give a movie near-sentient energy of its own. Pulp Fiction is a funny, mysterious, and gorgeously written movie that's a time-capsule for the 90s, like Back to the Future was for the 80s. Pulp Fiction is a darkly humorous, colourful and hard-to-guess story that's still loved to this very day, and for damn good reason: it's a film that has a little bit of something for everyone.Just like nearly every other Quentin Tarantino movie, the story is non-linear, stars Samuel L. Jackson, & pop-music and film references reign supreme in this film. Not to mention the 'Royale with cheese' quote, and 'Say 'what' again, I dare you, I double-dare you motherf##ker, say 'what' one more goddamn time!' This film is basically its own classic moment; from Vince's dance with Mia, to Butch's moment with the Taxi driver, everything is just so well done and just right."
20/12/2020,7,Fresh every single time. Scenes are well put together and took me over 5 times to get them (in my mind) together since the story follows 3 characters. Seen it over 15 times easily.
16/12/2020,7,"Although it describes the life of people at the bottom of society, it does not make people feel as vulgar as its title. This film is very interesting in structure, narrative, theme, soundtrack, and performance. It is an unforgettable gangster movie."
13/12/2020,7,"I am at a complete loss as to what anyone can see in this film. By it's very title it glorifies the days when ""story"" was a cheap and disposable commodity, and seeks to canonise it's lack of a script as a result. I'm sorry - ""anti-art"" has all been done before, and it wasn't very interesting with the dadaists back in 1915 either.Poor acting, a non-existent script, dialogue written by someone who thinks swearing still has ""shock"" value and endless, pointless violence. The burger discussion was the nearest thing to a highlight."
13/12/2020,7,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" not only is a fantastic achievement in film making, it also conjured up such a different perspective of the potential of mainstream Hollywood film. A complex tale of murder, humor and odd characters, suffused with pop-culture references, sharp and witty dialog, fantastic acting, a rollicking soundtrack of multiple different genres and ultimately an intriguing and game-changing story line directed almost flawlessly. There are faults, as in every film, scattered here and there, but they are subtle and even with a scrutinizing eye do not remove you from the experience of sitting and feasting your eyes upon this masterpiece on all fronts. There is very little else that can be said about this film, as everyone and their mothers has seen it, hopefully not together! ""Bring out the gimp."" I envy those cave-dwellers who have yet to see it and I urge you to do so. Right now!"
04/12/2020,8,"After opening his film-making career with the violent, gritty 'Reservoir Dogs' Quentin Tarantino followed it up with 'Pulp Fiction'. Told with a similar, non-linear storyline the latter follows the criminal lives of many characters, some of which intersect by coincidence. Tarantino's style of film-making is often incoherent, messy, and just plain obnoxious. While one can praise his entertainment factor, it's not good enough by itself to make a remarkable film. Such is this case with 'Pulp Fiction' which often relies too much on clever editing, smart acting, and foul language.The film starts off with two lovers talking in a diner: Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer). As they discuss previous criminal jobs, they suddenly decide to hold up the diner they're in. After they get up with guns, declaring their intentions the film goes to freeze frame and the opening credits role. To describe the entire plot of 'Pulp Fiction' would take too long, and is unnecessarily. It follows the lives of two hit men named Jules and Vincent (Academy Award nominees John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), a Mob Boss (Ving Rhames), his oddball wife (Uma Thurman), and a boxer at the end of his prime (Bruce Willis). Intertwined among these criminal characters are a myriad of different personalities. There's the twisted Zed, the classy Winston Wolf, and of course Tarantino himself as Jimmy. These characters often come together through different segments and numerous situations. They include a desperate trip to recover a sacred Golden Watch, a case of someone very important overdosing on Heroine, and a botched getaway from a job. The cast is impressive, featuring smaller roles from the likes of Steve Buscemi, Eric Stoltz, and Christopher Walken. While Tarantino has an impressive cast list to boot, other elements of the film often go wrong.The first thing that comes to mind in Tarantino's films is dialog. He works a labyrinth of different personalities, characters, and events while connecting them with one common theme. The main interaction in 'Pulp Fiction' is violence. It is sporadic, but it comes in bursts of graphic nature. There is, like in 'Reservoir Dogs' comedy mixed in with drama and even action. However, stylistically the combination is lacking. Tarantino ultimately has to use the f-word to establish a certain emotion or mood in his screenplay, rather than relying on directional technique. The cast emotes his dialog to their best of their abilities and the tough build of Jackson is impressive. He gets into his character and fully embodies the hit-man who grows a conscious. The rest of the cast are solid, but Jackson ultimately carries the show with his hilarious delivery and tone.Technically speaking, 'Pulp Fiction' doesn't accomplish anything new. There is interesting editing by Sally Menke, although the photography by Andrzej Sekula looks dated. A good deal of Tarantino's filmography deals more with more with the ""sound"" than the ""look"". There is a fun soundtrack thrown into the mix, but everything looks fairly standard as intended. Tarantino's direction feels off base, mainly because the material he gives himself doesn't really go anywhere. 'Sin City' is an example of a film that is purely based on style and looks, while Tarantino as a filmmaker tries to get a combination of intelligence and entertainment. As these two heads collide, things get messy. Does 'Pulp Fiction' really do anything new for cinema? There's quite a bit of swearing, yes, and the film is looked up to as something out-of-this-world but these are not striking elements. In 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' Tarantino once again heavily copies from other Kung Fu films, but in that regard he is able to create something distinctly entertaining and visually exuberant. The characters in 'Pulp Fiction' are degenerates, people who kill for a living and people who use drugs regularly. Tarantino has made personal remarks that he condemns this sort of behavior, yet the film stylizes both these elements as if there is a bigger mystique to them then there really is.In the end, I give 'Pulp Fiction' more than it's fair share of points. It entertains and it has some solid acting-Tarantino's (lack of) ability to really pull everything together for a solid point ends up being his wrongdoing once again.6/10"
25/11/2020,10,I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and this is surely his major creation! I love the fact that in this film there are many stories that are interweaving so nicely.Surely a Must to see!!
18/11/2020,10,"This is a very interesting movie, full of a strange charm. Although it describes the life of people at the bottom of society, it does not make people feel as vulgar as its title. This film is very interesting in structure, narrative, theme, soundtrack, and performance. It is an unforgettable gangster movie."
16/11/2020,10,"Tarentino does it again, only this time, he created a masterpiece.  Pulp Fiction is a fast paced thrilling ride through the eyes of a wonderful writer/director.  Also, there were Award winning actors such as Travolta and Jackson, who acted superb."
12/11/2020,10,"This movie is wonderful.  It completely met the nearly unrealistic expectations I had for it.  This is one of the few movies I've ever seen that was able to keep my complete attention for more than an hour and a half.  I admit, I haven't seen quite a few of the movies on the top 250 list, but this is, by far, the best movie I've seen so far: A+"
06/11/2020,10,"A very good movie this is,but one sees overtime that Pulp Fiction may be the most overrated movie of all time. Tarantino makes movies for teenagers and in the process takes what he does from other great directors and packages it as his own. This may be a great movie but no, though Tarantino's film may have achieved greatness this not the 9th greatest film of all time. Good, Tarantino may be but as good as he is he is twice as much a narcissistic, arrogant, loquacious,bad man. What I mean is I wouldn't spend my time with Tarantino, not so much because I don't like him, but because I can't stand the smell of his fans and the rest of his crony balogni phonies."
01/11/2020,9,"Long, granted but worth every second. A display of Tarantino's quality as a director and storyteller each segment is compelling and entertaining and even tense but all add up to the bigger picture and show how great the director truly can be when creating his worlds. A great mix of style and substance I highly reccomend this film"
29/10/2020,10,"Sounds weird right ? It really is and what helps this incredible story is Tarantino's non linear storytelling which has been copied several times from this revolutionary movie It simply revolutionized cinema from storytelling to the way of acting, directing, cinematography, etc.. And of course it benefits from Tarantino's Fantastic screenplay and coming off the huge success of the Oscar winning classic reservior dogs, people expected very much from this and it exceeded expectations in a way that people didn't think that was possible And of course 1994 can be called as cinema's best year and this is one of the greatest of all time Tarantino's fast and captivating dialogue made this 2 and half hours feel as if it was 2 and a half minutes The sky is the limit and Tarantino touched the sky and made it as good as it could get with this brilliant work The acting was top notch from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jakson and Uma Thurman in Oscar worthy performances and all were nominated but lost ultimatelyIncredibly well shot cinematography and outstanding directing from Tarantino made the classic that people still talk about 22 years onAnd the most brilliant part is Tarantino's screenplay which won the movie's only Oscar and that surprised me because it deserved so much more Samuel L. Jakson was robbed of an Oscar for best supporting actor and i still don't know how he didn't win it No words can describe what i just witnessed here and really this is a must watch and if you haven't watched it already then you miss so much and it really is one of the greatest everFor me i haven't seen something as brilliant as this since The Shawshank Redemption and The godfather so it is third on my own list"
26/10/2020,10,"Tarantino's crime spree trilogy continues with this epic pop culture underworld caper , A superstar cast with unmatched dialogue material deliver in spectacular fashion as their characters intertwine across a network of criminal activity in a cleverly designed mashed up timeline. Ultra violence and clever humour surround each character as they gate-crash each others lives through happenstance or misfortune were brewing conversations turn into explosive outcomes mostly at the end of a gun barrel , With a 30 yr anniversary looming this movie is still unrivalled and that is an incredible feat. Fantastically entertaining embedded in the top 10 a must see."
20/10/2020,10,"pulp fiction depicts many different stories relatively unlinked apart from a suspicious briefcase and the infamous gangster Marcellus Wallace. The way in which the film was made and filmed firmly placed the legendary Quentin Tarrantino as a talent to look out for and unsurprisingly his many more films in later years didn't disappoint. such films include inglorious bastards, Jackie brown, sin city and kill bill.pulp fiction begins in your average American diner, where Tim Roth (ringo) and Amanda plummer (honey bunny) are discussing new targets to steal from, after a small conversation they conclude that the diner they are in, should be the subject of armed robbery, and so pulp fiction begins, displaying its violent theme from the offset.throughout the rest of the 2 and a half hour film the audience experiences many Effs and Jeffs, thrills, lots of gun fire and a marmite display of the character 'jimmy' (Quentin tarratino. also there is ever present amazing acting performances from Samuel L Jackson (jules Winnfield) john Travolta (vincent Vega) and Bruce willis (butch Coolidge). Pulp fiction deserved many more Oscars than the one it got for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. its a highly entertaining film which deserves many many watches and will go down in movie making history as a classic.Harry Cole"
17/10/2020,10,"I was so looking forward to this movie because I had heard such great things about it. disappointed would be a huge understatement. what the Hell was this movie about? as far as I could tell there was no story, zero, nothing. literally nothing happened. there was no plot, no believable characters, not even a single interesting scene or line of dialog to bump this film up to a 2 in my opinion. just a total and absolute waste of time making and watching this movie. I know movies are subjective, but I just do not get how anyone can find this film remotely entertaining in any way. there are several films in the top 250 I have seen and agree they should be there. this belongs in the bottom 3, along with ""Fargo"" and ""American Beauty""."
17/10/2020,10,"The plot is a little more complicated than usual. The film opens with a couple played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plumber excellently by the way. In fact, there is not a single slacker in the whole film. Soon the viewer begins to realize these two people are up to no good. Then the film cuts to two hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) who are on their way to extract money that a group of college kids owe their boss. Soon, more characters are added to the growing storyline and the intensity level is heightened.The sequences in this film are out of order. This is actually a good thing because the director, Quentin Tarantino(KILL BILL, JACKIE BROWN) doesn't want to show you that part of the story or that character yet. By doing this he is able to take the opportunity to continuously provide a consistent tone and level of humor while at the same time shocking us with unexpected graphic violence. I found this approach to be very stylish and effective in creating genuine emotion.The soundtrack perfectly complements the character's mindsets and the mood of the film. The end result makes for some really very memorable scenes throughout. While the film is basically a crime comedy, the music, in addition to the context of the scenes and the dialogue, are full of personality and classiness. This film is that it isn't for every taste. Sure there are things in this film that any open-minded viewer can admire about it, but the film is very over the top in it's scenes of graphic violence. One scene in particular is a grotesque nod to DELIVERENCE. This film is not for the squeamish. This is the kind of film that can be watched over and over and will always be exciting and fulfilling until the end. It's a modern classic. It's entertaining, brutal, funny, and unforgettable. It's a true classic that has inspired many many films and yet still manages to be just as entertaining as it was in 1994. It holds up perfectly and it's a must-see if you haven't seen it yet."
12/10/2020,10,"Pulp Fiction is, without any doubt, a pillar of the modern cinema, that has so much inspiration and references nice to notice and Tarantino, use these elements to polish his art.Everything was perfect, down to the last-minute details. Samuel L. Jackson had a one in a life actor performance. It was just phenomenal, the way his emotions translate to the screen, his charisma, his voice, it was so good and it's the same thing for John Travolta and Uma Thurman. There is also an iconic soundtrack.On top of that, I think that this movie describes a realistic side of gangsters; it shows us that they are not all bad, that they are human, that they are not invincible, that they enjoy simple things.And of course, that movie got everything, drama, action, adventure, it can also be seen as a race against time with an excellent plot and a mastered pacing.To make it short this movie is unique, iconic and so inspirational."
09/10/2020,10,"After recently re-watching this movie, I am convinced that Tarantino is an expert in the human condition.The characters and nuances of each distinct personality are well worth a third and fourth watch.The stories lead me to believe this is written from real life experiences and perspective. Tarantino uses a strong ""what if we did this"" motif throughout.His writing has a wit and sharp bite that gives it a fill of memorable lines and monologues. While using pop culture references and mundane, topics that show a lack of interest or excitement in the topics, it engages us and makes the characters feel more real and relatable.Blending dark comedy and intense drama, with sudden bursts of violence keep us on edge and holds us in thrall with ""what's next?"""
08/10/2020,10,"This film worries me.  Is it great as so many say?  It's riveting viewing that's for sure.  Movies need to satisfy 5 criteria to be truly great (in my humble opinion): totally committed believable acting, technical excellence, memorable scenes that recur in your mind, something fresh to say or way to say it, and a message at its heart that can change people's lives (hopefully for the better).  This film has the first four in abundance, but fails completely on the fifth.The film is a dazzling kaleidoscope of images, sounds and emotions.It is one of the most vital films of the 90s without a doubt.  Though there is quite a lot of violence, it's less painful to watch than in other movies (e.g. Goodfellas). Rather there's a constant sense of menace, because you know Mr Quentin always has some ultra-violence and jolts to the viewer, and also the non-linear structure means it's more difficult to figure out who's going to get hit.  You get this sense of foreboding right from the off, when the couple are discussing robbing the diner, and the gun goes down on the table with a much louder noise than it should to match the volume of the dialogue.
Best part of the film for me was the dancing sequence - couldn't help thinking so that's how the excellent dancer of Saturday Night Fever ended up!  I have to say that they didn't get proper medical advice for this movie - giving an injection into the heart as for the overdose can't be done through the sternum (breastbone), but it has to go underneath, angled upwards.  I'm pretty sure that giving a slug of adrenaline to someone who's overdosed on cocaine would kill the person instantly rather than wake them up.  And who decided to call the drug adrenaline (its British name) when it's called epinephrine in the US?  I'm left with the impression that this was just another scene that the film makers wanted to include to shock people, rather than trying to make it true to life.  Most worrying aspect is the very graphic depiction of heroin injection. It's made to seem glamorous and seductive.  Anybody trying to get off heroin who watches this movie will have a hard time resisting the impulse to follow the example shown on screen.  I think this particular scene should not have been included in the movie.  Again there's a medical inaccuracy - the blood shown being drawn back into the syringe before injecting is too bright red, that's arterial blood rather than blood from a vein.  Maybe they thought bright red makes it look more vivid (and shocking)?Overall I think this film is worth watching if you know what to expect and like that kind of thing.  However it has an empty heart which makes it fall way short of greatness.  My opinion is that tarantino is very talented in film making, but this takes a back seat compared to his desire to shock people at any cost."

06/10/2020,10,"Pulp Fiction is a very good movie. It deserves to be hailed as one of the best movies ever to be made. Pulp Fiction is sheer entertainment at it's very best. After watching 2/3 of the movie you've got nothing - you've just been watching a reel of historical movie scenes. You haven't got a red line to follow until the last few scenes, where it all comes falling together. You've just been thrilled by the best entertainer of a movie, for 2 hours hour, when the movie makes this genius move, to keep you contemplating for at least another week. No deep meanings here, like in 8 1/2 or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Just a 2 1/2 hour roller coaster, with an infinite amount of riddles. Like Marsellus' neck patch, the weird character that Harvey Keitel plays (The Wolf, problem solver) and the contents of the briefcase. What also strikes you when watching a Tarantino movie is the dialog  I've only seen one director master the art as good  Stanley Kubrick, but that's a different story. This is purely an hail to the movie that made a huge impact on me. The spectacular dialog, and great acting  and not to mention the story ending up in a beautiful circle! Entertaining at it's best! Compliments to Quentin Tarantino!"
05/10/2020,10,"Quentin Tarantino is the used car salesman of Hollywood, and this film is just another previously-owned cheap ride. The glowing suitcase bit was stolen from the 1955 noir film Kiss Me Deadly. Samuel L. Jackson's bible-quoting hitman character was stolen from the 1973 Japanese martial arts film Karate Kiba. Tarantino takes four anecdotes and cuts them out of order to fool the viewer. Tarantino knows his story his boring, so he splatters blood around various sets, uses profanity to an extreme, and regresses to violence befitting of his character. His success is in knowing the vast majority of the public does not watch movies made before their own birthdate, so he can get away with cinematic larceny. At a Hollywood film panel, in 2006, a popular film critic called Tarantino a ""hack"" to which the audience applauded."
15/09/2020,10,"This is the one film that re-writes the book of film-making. Unfortunately Quentin could never and can never repeat such a masterpiece. There are elements of brilliance in his other films but none of them reach the brilliance of each everyday dialogue between the characters that makes it so riveting. So many actors were re-discovered with this movie. John Travolta found that be could be a serious actor outside a music score, Samuel L Jackson found the big break he was destined for, Tim Roth following on from Reservoir Dogs had to be taken seriously across the pond, Bruce Willis must have thanked his stars for featuring in this film without his A-list fee. Ving Rhames Mr big re-rejuvenated his career and this was the sling-shot that catapulted Uma Thurman to fame. nu ff saidEric Stolz played his part to perfection and Harvey Keital was on song."
14/09/2020,10,This movie will forever be one of the best ones out there. Cult classic. Id definitely give this one a watch if you haven't already. So many memorable scenes and characters and you'll end up quoting the movie in your day to day lives.
12/09/2020,10,"I actually like this film a little more than some other R-rated films, including ""Do the Right Thing"". There are more good scenes that I could watch than other R-rated films. However, like ""Do the Right Thing"", this doesn't touch my heart. One bad thing about this film is that there was a bit of violence that I really don't want to see. In terms of the other parts of this film, they are okay, like the fight scene, but they also have some drawbacks. In my opinion, the worst thing about this film is once again some partial nudity. I have never liked seeing some movies that include nudity, starting with ""The Graduate"". But not everything is bad. There are some good parts in this film, including great acting, nice cinematography, and very good lighting effects. The rest of the stuff in the film are like a hit and miss for me. Overall, this is a good film, but it doesn't offer as much comparing to the other films that I reviewed."
30/08/2020,7,"It's the best movie I've ever seen.Pulp Fiction made my believe to the chance stronger.It really exists,I mean luck.The screenplay is wonderful,dialogs are interesting and the characters are understandable.Tarantino's made a miracle that will never be forgotten.Pulp Fiction's incredible dialogs and great acts and informal story,made me not to move until the end.Mr.Director and his movie changed my idea about all the movies I watched after that.There's a dialog throughout the movie from the Holy Bible:""And I will strike down upon thee with the great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.""It may be about me.At first I suspected him and I wanted to poison and destroy his brothers!But he really did it!He revenged me and after he got finished I really felt damned and crushed.I thought Pulp Fiction is not a good one to spend your time and watch it.But it actually cost. I'm sure it was one of the movies that its beginning was the end of it.Or in better language,it was one of the first postmodern movies.Take it easy. How can your luck be bad?This movie has lots of bad chances.Your boss's wife overdoses and is dying on you and this thing must be unknown.What will you do?You get out of the toilet and see your enemy is standing right at opposite of you and wants to kill you with your own gun.Or you're talking to your friend and he's sitting at the car's behind seat.You look at him during the talk and your pistol's in your hand,suddenly your gun takes the shot by itself.You haven't shot the legs,hands,or even the chest;You've shot straight at your friend's head!And when you wake up,you've taken s--t in the car and it's full of blood and skull pieces.What will you do to hide from the cops?There are many things like this.Well it's great.Enjoy the acts and screenplay.Some dialogs are so funny some are about bad things.Pulp Fiction is a real pulp fiction.PULP FICTION IS THE LORD."
08/08/2020,7,"Like most people, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Pulp Fiction' and found it to be a refreshing change to the predictable and stereotypical drama/action movies we are used to seeing. 'Pulp Fiction' rips up the rule book and completely rewrites it.The film is bizarre, but not in a way that disillusions the audience. Instead, it's thoroughly gripping and demands attention. The dialogue is probably the best part of the film, you could tell from the opening scene alone that this is no ordinary dialogue and no ordinary movie.Good stuff, kept me entertained for the full 2hr 30m run time. Not a film I would consider among the best I have ever seen, but a refreshingly unique movie that I would happily watch again."
06/08/2020,7,When I seen Rocky I felt like I wish I could do that (Make movies.) When I seen Pulp Fiction I was like I have to find away to do that. It's an ADHD brain at it's finest. I believe Jules is the every man character you know anyone whoever wanted more out of their life. Although Butch plays a similar part he's stuck in the chaos. What's in the case is? Hope. Hope for a new life walking the earth and such.
04/08/2020,7,"Pulp Fiction is a great movie, it takes everything you know about movies, and throws it away and it absolutely works! The cast is amazing, the scrip is one of the best ever written and in the first time you watch it you may not understand the timeline of the movie but it's pretty complicated but if you're watching the movie carefully, you will understand the timeline and everything just like i did, I totally recommend this movie to anyone beyond the ago of 14, I know it's rated R but kids after the ago of 14 will totally understand what's happening, but you must be mature enough to watch this movie, there are a lot of intense scenes in the movie."
04/08/2020,7,"Some scenes that totally worth it to watch this movie over and over. the scene of the blood with the H, when Mia is OD, when Travolta and Mia are talking about a relationship and then started to dance, it is just amazing how Quentin Tarantino could reach that level of movie, one of the biggest movies of all times with i think Reservoir Dogs.I could recommend this film to almost everybody and i think everyone could fall in love with this movie. In the other hand the soundtrack is amazing i love it all especially those sad songs like Lonesome Town, If Love was a red dress. And the way the actors get into the character is very cool"
27/07/2020,9,"Vincent: And you know what they call a... a... a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris? Jules: They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese? Vincent: No man, they got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the f--k a Quarter Pounder is. Jules: Then what do they call it? Vincent: They call it a ""Royale"" with cheese. Jules: A ""Royale"" with cheese! What do they call a Big Mac? Vincent: A Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it ""le Big-Mac"". Jules: ""Le Big-Mac""! Ha ha ha ha! What do they call a Whopper? Vincent: I dunno, I didn't go into Burger King.Directed by Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction a ""cool"" movie directed beautifully by Tarantino.Jules: Oh! F--k's happening! Vincent: Man, I shot Marvin in the face. Jules: Why the f--k did you do that! Oh man I've seen some crazy ass s--t in my time! Vincent: Chill out, man. I told you it was an accident. You probably went over a bump or something. Jules: Hey, the car didn't hit no motherf---ing bump. Vincent: Hey, look man, I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch! The gun went off. I don't know why. Jules: Well look at this f---ing mess, man. We're on a city street in broad daylight. Vincent: I don't believe it. Jules: Well believe it now, motherf---er! We gotta get this car off the road. You know cops tend to notice s--t like your driving a car drenched in f---ing blood.The performances are excellent, the editing is as excellent, and the dialogue is crisp and cool!""The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright. He'd be damned if any of the slopes were gonna get their greasy yellow hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something: his ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.""The only flaw this picture contains is the Bruce Willis scenes! Those scenes were a let down. However, the only scene featuring Willis which I enjoyed was the one were him and Ving were in the basement of the gun shop!Regardless what makes this movie work are the characters of Vincent and Jules played by John Travolta and Sam Jackson.3 1/2(***1/2)out of 4(****)stars"
27/07/2020,9,This is one of the most original movies of our time. Completely unique form of directing and editing. Storyline is very engaging and entertaining. Keeps you on your toes at all times throughout the movie.
26/07/2020,9,"I absolutely love this movie!  The first time I saw it, I thought it was excellent, but I didn't really get a good taste of it until watching it two more times.  It's the type of movie you just have to see more than once, because of all the plot twists and turns.  Tarantino's dialogue is great, and the acting is downright amazing.  SAMUEL JACKSON IS UNBELIEVABLE.  I really like this movie."
26/07/2020,9,"I do not understand the hype. This movie was nothing but a waste of my time.Why? First, I believe a movie should have a clearly outlined plot so that you know what's going on. This movie doesn't feature that. It starts out of nowhere with no apparent background and has a pointless ending.There are indeed a couple of scenes that might be fun to watch if you are in the ""right mind"" (however most are violent and immature) and the actors do an excellent performance but that doesn't pump this movie up to anything good. It kind of shows you the happenings of a few drugdealers and criminals within a short timeframe, that's all.To sum it up... this movie has few redeeming qualities. Do something productive and more fun instead. Such as washing the dishes.Two stars out of ten."
22/07/2020,9,"Personally I think Quentin Tarantino is a lunatic, but a creative, unusual, unique, (ok I can think of at least 20 more adjectives)writer/director, and yes, even a VERY good actor. He has never made a movie (to my knowledge) the he did not either have a supporting role or a cameo. ""From Dusk 'till Dawn"" he made a brilliant move with Cheech playing three roles. As 'Jimmy' he was an actor of the highest caliber. Brought back Travolta for a mere $450,000, a STEAL but a good business move. Quentin wrote the storyline to ""Natural Born Killers"" just before he wrote the screenplay of Pulp Fiction. Convinced Producers to give him an $8 million budget, that returned over $100,000,000 in North America and when you count world-wide it doubles. I think Kill Bill Vol. 3 is going to be very good."
21/07/2020,9,"Pulp Fiction. It's the answer you give when a child comes running up to you and asks 'what is cinema?'. It's the definition you give to someone when they question cool, style and most of all pure entertainment. From it's pulp visuals to flawless direction, superb screenplay to mesmerising characters, its better than the best sex you will ever have. Endlessly quotable and watchable, captivating making every turn more exciting than the last. More than a experience, but a passage into life, because if you ain't a 'Bad Mother F****R', then you ain't sh*t!"
20/07/2020,9,"I can't really say much more than everyone has but I have to throw in my 2cents to my favorite film ever. Samuel L Jackson, Travolta, Thurman, Stolz, Willis, Walken, Roth and Tarantino all fighting for top place, and they all win in their own roles. I hate the Oscars for giving the Best Picture to Forest Gump- typical oscar bullsh*t. Pulp Fiction is, in a word, Brilliant. In fact, i'm going to go and watch it again."
17/07/2020,9,"This film is only good to watch if you have literally nothing else to do fro 2 and a half hours, its pretty average but to have it be called ""One of the greatest films ever"" and win an oscar for best writing just doesn't seem right. I do like other QT movie but this one just kinda... sucked."
15/07/2020,9,"Iconic. Memorable. Complete. 'Pulp Fiction' is more than just a movie.Intertwining multiple different personalities, Quentin Tarantino perfects the fast-paced, unpredictable sequence of throwing off the audience and supplying scenes of peculiar and extraordinary nature.John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Tim Roth star in the crime-drama, encapsulating the enthusiasm and craziness of their script. Tarantino himself plays the character of Jimmie, and lets just say his role is nothing short of incredible, arguably the one of the best in film. It is ultimately the characters and acting performances that make the spectacle just so special, and nails the quantity of seriousness and humour to a tee (as expected with the man behind the camera).A classic discussion about fast food chains and an enigmatic dance routine help create what can only be described as a masterpiece, every blackout of the screen entices the viewer to what the next passage has in store, it is simply gripping. This is what cinema is all about, mystery, suspense and fascination rolled into one, a film where you can laugh on numerous occasions but still want to know what will happen next.An Oscar winner for 'Original Screenplay', the blockbuster is a quintessential ornament to the industry, evoking that not all movies need to follow a step-by-step book.Ask me what the watch is about, and I couldn't give you an explanation in under 50 words: and that, is why for me, it is the greatest film ever made."
13/07/2020,9,"Absolutely no idea why this film is so popular. I was bored out of my mind from the first scene to the last waiting patiently for a twist of some sort to tie the multiple stories together, which never happened. Probably my least favorite movie i've ever watched. The acting wasn't bad and the film did tie in some aspects of popular culture and previous films, but if the viewer doesn't give a crap about any of the characters whatsoever, or the plot(if you could call it that), then whats the point. I gained nothing from watching this movie besides an intense feeling of emptiness that usually comes after wasting 150 or so minutes of your life watching a pathetic piece of crap film about nothing. Was I at the edge of my seat, yes, however It wasn't because of the suspense, I couldn't keep my head from falling forward or my eyes open. And the way that the scenes were arranged, terrible. The movie memento is hard to follow sometimes and slightly dull at some points but at least there was a freaking point in the way the scenes were arranged, considering the main character had memory problems. In this movie, there was no reason for the random mix up of the scenes, except to just do something different and make a movie so weird and disgusting the critics think its a masterpiece. I usually like movies that are critically acclaimed, like The Godfather, one of my favorite movies, but Pulp Fiction isn't even in the ball park. There isn't the dark complex characters like in the godfather, just a bunch of rambling idiots tripping over their stupidity."
12/07/2020,9,"When I think about what makes a film good, I base that on whether it has the ability to do either of the following things: be entertaining or be thought-provoking. Some films rely almost solely on the entertainment aspect, such as Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow whereas others require lots of thought and study i.e 2001 or practically anything by David Lynch. Pulp Fiction achieves both these aspects to the extreme.The film contains a decent number of scenes where the characters have lengthy conversations about every day, generally mundane topics which may sound boring but trust me it's definitely not. Quentin Tarantino is an expert at film dialogue, the characters in this film could be talking about something like paint drying and still have you clinging onto every word that they say. None of these characters are stereotypes in any way. For example, I'll try not to give anything away, but in one scene you have two hit men having a conversation about fast food joints just before they commit a brutal murder.This film has been analysed and pondered for at least fifteen years now and there are still aspects of the film which no-one can even begin to comprehend. Nevertheless, this film is still hugely watchable. Even with it's sometimes painful scenes of graphic violence and downright human depravity. But don't let that put you off, Pulp Fiction is a rich cinematic experience and a film that you won't easily forget. A definite must see.10/10 - Classic"
09/07/2020,9,"Pulp Fiction is by far my favorite movie of all time. Samuel L. Jackson, Travolta, Willis, and Keitel in particular give amazing performances. Tarantino does an excellent job directing the twists and turns of the plot and the idea behind the story line is terrific, his acting in the movie is also underrated."
09/07/2020,9,"What can I say, Quentin Tarantino changed something in movies. And this and Resoirvor Dogs was the one's that put him on the map. Now I must say this is a harsh movie, it shows stuff that's rarely shown in films, it is also realistic, and heck even funny at times. This is a good definition of a good film. It's well made, it's well written, and it's provocative. It's not the kind of film you turn on on a Saturday night for some fun, but if you like film, you must watch this. But I warn you, it's R rated for a reason. I guess the expression ""can you handle the real world?"" really makes sense in this movie. So if your a film buff and you haven't seen this, what are you waiting for? I give this film a 10/10."
06/07/2020,9,"I don't get this film and why it's so great according to Siskel and Ebert or other critics. Maybe it's the style of filming that is both experimental and groundbreaking, all I found was that there was so much cursing and swearing and a weak plot. I love the scene where John Travolta dances with Uma Thurman. It's silly but memorable, probably the most memorable scene from the film. I think the film is disappointing because I preferred the spoofs from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV versions. This film is completely about life in Los Angeles. I liked the interaction between the two hit men played by Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's characters. It seemed to be real. I don't understand the diner experience. I thought it was out of place. I think I have to watch it again and again to finally get it."
04/07/2020,9,"Could someone please tell me, why this movie is so damned popular? People say, that I simply don't understand it! I admit it, no, I simply can't see anything interesting in this piece of ....! Just like the other movies of Tarantino and my own fellow country man, Lars Von Trier, who has also been so over-praised by the critics! I would like to say, that I do find ""difficult"" films like the films of Kieslowski, Fassbinder etc. interesting, these films are about real characters... and not some overestimated roles. Well, we all have different tastes, including films, but until this moment, no one has ever been able to argue why Pulp Fiction is his/her personal favourite movie of all time, they always just say that this movie is so cool, exciting, interesting etc."
03/07/2020,9,"I remember movies BP(Before Pulp), they were boring, dull, and lame retreads of one another. Then a movie about two hit men, a boxer, a mob boss and his wife, a gold watch and a suitcase came along and restored my faith in film. There are only two flaws in Pulp. The scenes w/Butch and Fabion drag a little and the movie ends. One complaint that I often hear is that people don't understand what the movie was about. The movie is about Redemption plain and simple. Some people don't see it but it is there. I still remember the first time I saw it and I kept trying to figure out where the movie was going. I was wrong everytime I guessed. Another great thing about it is that each story can work independently of each other. I've watched the three stories separately and still enjoy each one of them. My favourite story is ""The Bonnie Situation"". Much needed comic relief after ""The Gold Watch"". Great stories, great script, great cast, great music and simply the best movie ever made."
27/06/2020,9,"Pulp Fiction follows a non-linear narrative structure, meaning it is told out of chronological order. It follows three interlaced stories of multiple characters. One follows the story of Vince Vega (John Travolta), as he and his friend Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) arrive at an apartment in order to retrieve a briefcase that belongs to their boss. They murder one of the guys that stole it and then Jules recites an Ezekiel passage from the bible before executing the other one, as they double-crossed their boss. This is where the iconic lines are said by Samuel L. Jackson - ""I dare you mother*cker, I double dare you"".Being a Tarantino classic, this film blew up back at the date of its release, because of how violent and real it seemed. The characters are very believable and the brilliance of the film is smug. Everyone's destiny in the film plays out, either coming to a halt or ending in a further story. The non-linear structure, divided into different stories, makes it seem like you are reading a book, which switches character perspectives in order to tell you more, but at the same time leave you wanting more information. The situations in the film are absurd, unique, inventive even, the same can be said for the dialogue, as the audience is left guessing, not knowing what anyone will say at any moment, seeing how wild and alive it is. The characters never sound the same.Showing the life of the 90's throughout its' characters, the film does not leave you bored, trying to entertain you with aforementioned situations, as Tarantinos' writing is meant to and knocking you off your feet, as the absurd takes its turn, another timeless classic shows us how films are supposed to be made."
23/06/2020,9,"Once again we have the phenomenon of Tennessee QT ripping off classic outside-Hollywood '60s and '70s fare, copying the superficial elements, and failing to deliver any kind of meaningful context. Hey, dude, there was a reason it worked in the first place. But, no, his acolytes will attend this latest black mass and congratulate each other on all the vacuous references they can recognize.This is a total rip-off of La Mala Ordina. The only thing he adds is some dialog between the hit men. He should've left it out if that's the best he can do.His biography should be out soon. If truly titled, it would be, ""A Typical Redneck Tries Art-house"". Sound pretty awful? Well, the movie is worse."
20/06/2020,9,Highly overrated and unnecessarily crude.  Can't believe what some people see in this one.  Wastes the talent of the great Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman on vapid script by then-newcomer Tarentino.  Wish I could give it a negative rating.
14/06/2020,9,"Pulp Fiction has really gotten me into Tarantino's works, and this is the perfect movie to showcase his talents. This is a small-time gangster story, set in LA, but pretty much subverts the traditional Goodfellas-esquire manner we are used to.For starters, the characters are developed in a way which makes us care about their fates, with conversations over things like what a big-mac is called in Europe early on. John Travolta and SLJ have a wonderful rapport on screen, delivering lines wittily, and sharply. A good thing, as the film is driven by a clever and disarming script, so none of the 148 minutes run-time feels wasted.The non-chronological narrative certainly helps to keep things fresh, and coupled with Tarantino's stylish use of cinematography, and trademark framing shots, making this film something very different to anything else on offer.Overall, this film is Definitely worth your time and money, (and a second viewing to appreciate all the nuances that make it so special), and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Fantastic work."
11/06/2020,9,"Violent, funny, unpredictable and stylish, this one's got it all.John Travolta plays unbelievably cool as the drugged hit-man Vincent, and Samuel L. Jackson delivers an equally great performance as his partner, Jules. Also worth mentioning is Bruce Willis, starring as the boxer Butch, and Johnny Walken, who delivers a long speak about a gold watch being worn in the ass for seven years by him and another private in the war, before delivering the watch to his fellow private's son.Quentin Tarantino's directing is utter class, and the story is so unpredictable that you could see it a dozen times and yet never know what's going to happen next. The writing and the music is equally good, and all in all, this is a highly recommendable movie that is sure to affect you in some way or the other. See it-Now."
10/06/2020,9,"First of all, I have seen this Film many, many times. I have watched it and re watched it, and I still can't understand the Praise this film gets. I am first of all A Big Tarantino fan, but NO, i do not like Pulp Fiction and nothing will ever convince me to like it. The Film has become a victim of its own popularity, every knows the quotes and scenes. But that's all it is, a collection of witty dialogue. I Could not care who doesn't agree with me. I'll go as far to say I like the soundtrack, but that's it.If you want a Tarantino Film that's far better than this Overrated Junk, Watch Jackie Brown."
10/06/2020,9,"I saw this film expecting a very original well written masterpiece and I was not let down in the slightest. Pulp Fiction must rank as one of the wittiest funniest and truly enjoyable films I have ever seen. And to top it all, the film boasts a star studded list of fine actors who all seem to give their utmost in performing their roles.There were two things that made the film as good as it was: the dialogues (which of course is what Tarantino is famous for) and the humour. What I liked most, however, was the humour. The `Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?' sequence certainly cracked me up. For me, though, there could and should have been even more of such humorous episodes."
29/05/2020,2,"Maybe I'm just stupid, maybe I just have bad taste but this movie didn't fully click with me. And I don't think it's the masterpiece that a lot people make it out to be. I definitely don't think it's bad maybe it's just not my cup of tea. I walked away and took away a whole lot of nothing I'm sitting here trying to think of maybe what was the big thing that I'm supposed to leave the movie with like the message or even just what it wanted to say and to be honest idk it was just a lot of stuff. A lot cool stuff and stuff I enjoyed watching. I just don't get it. Maybe I'm supposed to rewatch it and I'll get it then but that in it of it self takes away some points for me cause I should at least have something the first time around something more to motivate me to watch it again then just confusion cause tbh as I said I just don't get it.Now I just read some stuff explaining what the movie was trying to do more. Tbh I think it's cool and all what it's trying to do sure but it's just so confusing and sure movies that make you think are cool but at least for me it's trying to make you think too much. Like I think it's cool and all but when I'm going to watch a movie I don't wanna have to leave needing to read some explainer articles like i don't wanna have to be a massive film buff to enjoy a movie I should be able to enjoy it whether I know a lot about movies or not."
27/05/2020,2,"I saw this movie nine times in the theater when it came out; it resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genres.The second directorial effort from then fairly unknown Tarantino but it was a brilliant sophomore effort hitting the proper notes on all the main categories; directing, score, cinematography, acting / casting, plot, writing, etc. I cannot suggest this film to everyone; you need a certain sense of humor and a certain means of looking at a plot-line to truly enjoy it, but for those that have those prerequisites this is required viewing.This film in my top tier and one that can be watched at any time. An extremely well constructed piece of film-making that is worthy of a viewing."
01/05/2020,2,"I like to think that any Hollywood director who dedicated their life to making movies can look back at one film and think ""At least I made my mark"". Kubrick had 2001, Scorsese will have Goodfellas and Tarantino, well, he'll have Pulp Fiction.I watched this film on release, when all we really knew about Tarantino was Reservoir Dogs. It's hard for me to think what someone viewing it more than a quarter of a century later would make of it. Hopefully it can be viewed in context and see how revolutionary the film really was.One striking thing, which was quite novel at the time, is how the scenes aren't shown chronologically. What at first seems like a gimmick makes more and more sense as the film progresses and on repeat viewings. The impact of the storytelling would have been nowhere near as great if told in a more traditional way.If you're new to Tarantino then lucky you, you've got some great movies to watch. You won't go wrong by starting with Pulp Fiction."
28/04/2020,5,"This is one of movie that raising Tarantino to an apex level. He was so young that day, but already mobilizing his career expeditiously. Reservoir dogs, his first movie, is one kind of movie, using a similar 90s retro theme. Those style was an inheritance of Tarantino, it was his original natural-touch. His 90s movies severely enjoyable for young and mid-aged people. Nowadays, his 90s movie prevalent considered as trend-setter which used by so many directors nowadays, for example lets look at kill bill. Stylish but harsh with slow-mo action shot and consider the raid 2 and kingsman : secret service as its descendant.Pulp fiction is a film which considered as classic. Lets try to analyze it distinctly. First thing first, i am gonna highlight the performance of Samuel L Jackson. Indisputably, Jacksons performance is potent. You cant contest this level of characterization without any serious contemplation, because in this movie, Jackson ranked highly in top performance of all time category. Even an amateur audience could say this level of acting is above average. I even feel scared by his act (interrogating scene), its like I've been really charged by a verdict and witness him ready to gut me was really haunting and obnoxious.Secondly, the writing. Honestly, the plot could drive me from not in a mod into a freak. The joy element implicitly delivered from the writing to the audience. The interrogating scene, driving scene (in early duration), and of course the magnificent dancing scene. All these scenes were devoted by great screenplay technique. For example lets take a look and analyze the interrogating scene. Watch and remember Jacksons movement and watch the camera position carefully. At early, Tarantino using some establishing shot and some full-shot to all characters inside. It brings an introduction message while giving suspense to audience. Jacksons movement from outside the door to in the middle of the room to in front of sofa is a support to these shots. It sends horror expression to the interrogated characters. Then lately, while berating and punishing Tarantino using close-up shot and extreme close-up shot to execute. These give a huge pressure and impoverishing the morale of interrogated person. The force of pressure intensified by slow-paced play as Jackson moving. Those was an example of incredible screenplay and writing technique. This technique also used by legendary director Sergio Leone to his western movies.The 90s euphoria direction was the highest aspect of this movie. It shape the whole film with joyful nostalgic of 90s, such as the music and pop culture. The nostalgic invention of this new movie in 90s permeated to the whole audience until now. It persist as a classic nowadays. Tarantino was a terrific boy these day."
28/04/2020,5,"When Pulp Fiction first came out, I thought it was the greatest movie ever made and was sure that it would become a classic. Earlier today though, I saw it again after not viewing it for several years and my opinion of it is now a bit lower.It's still a good movie and there are aspects of it that are certainly great. The plot is well constructed and the story lines are compelling. There are a variety of interesting characters and many humorous and dramatic scenes. Several actors (who were at their peak at the time) have juicy roles and give excellent performances: Uma Thurman, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, and Christopher Walken. Overall, the movie is unbelievably entertaining.After seeing Pulp Fiction again though, with several more years of movie viewing experience now under my belt, parts of it look amateurish. The shots don't always work; composition is bad, stuff is out of focus, lighting is bad. Although the banal conversations are fantastic, the dialogue doesn't work all the time either, particularly for Samuel L. Jackson's character. When I listened to him, I couldn't help but think that this is how a white dude thinks a black gangster should talk. There are also a ton of obvious continuity and factual errors in the film that are distracting (check the ""Goofs for Pulp Fiction"" page here at IMDB for an incomplete listing of them). In most movies, I don't notice these kinds of errors because they're so subtle, but in Pulp Fiction they're glaring.Pulp Fiction is still cool and enjoyable, but it seems like I can look at it in a more critical light now. It's been almost ten years since it was made and the hype is finally starting to die down. It's a good (maybe great) film, but it's not a classic or a masterpiece."
26/04/2020,5,"The title says it all! This film is Tarantino's Masterpiece! The cast is one the best I've ever seen, the plot is so complicated that you have to think during the film to understand it! This film is so memorable and you can you watch it as many times as you want and you will love it every time the same as the last time! Please go and watch this film! It worths it!"
25/04/2020,5,"An incredible film, what can I say about this masterpiece?The film is a mix of emotions, the setting, soundtrack, performances, memorable scenes, memorable lines.Very well set in California in the 80's. It conveys very well the atmosphere of the time, through music, haircut, clothes, cars, among others.It certainly influenced countless works, a film that will never be forgotten."
24/04/2020,5,"I don't deny that this film is 100% entertainment and the dialogue is solid gold; but that would be nothing without the terrific actors. To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it must've been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesn't disencourage them. I can't help but resent the film for the fact it's usually the film that gets people into film (can't disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesn't have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that I'd like to know, to be honest. If it wasn't such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though. However, I cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach does not offend me. I completely understand the acclaim it gets.8/10"
23/04/2020,5,"OK first of all I saw this a little while ago and I don't see how anybody could like this film except for the stars: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Peter Greene, Bruce Willis, and Ving Rhames. The plot is all messed around and unorganized making it very difficult to understand. The Characters are all technically bad guys. Like I said the only good thing this film has to offer is the acting. Overall the film makes very little sense the way it is told, the characters are all unlikable. I really believe that if any film should get rated way lower than a 0 out of ten, this is it! I mean just how it got as high as an 8.9 out of 10 is beyond me. I'd continue on ranting about how bad the story is written but this film just isn't worth anymore time. Please if you're wanting to see a great crime film go watch Goodfellas(1990) and if you want to go see a good action film go watch the Hunted(2003). This film rated from me is only a 1 out of 10 since it did have many famous and good actors but Mars Attacks is way better and that was a comedy film!!!"
22/04/2020,5,"With his 1994 film Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino perfected his unique style of fractured narrative, explosive film making. Whereas the earlier Reservoir Dogs contains elements of the corrupted, overlapping narrative, it delivers its stories clumsily, only hinting at the overwhelming, challenging style that Pulp Fiction would eventually bring. His influence is evident in the way that so many young emerging film makers have emulated his rapidly delivered story lines and fractured narrative structure, from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels through to Go, or Run Lola Run. He remains one of the world's most influential and gifted film-makers, and Pulp Fiction is clearly his most impressive work to date."
21/04/2020,5,"OK, first of all we all know that ""Pulp Fiction"" barrows heavily from other films (check out IMDB's movie connections link), but what really is the legacy of great films (""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", ""The Godfather"", etc.) is the way it influences all of its movie descendents.  With movies ranging from ""The Usual Suspects"", to ""The Matrix"", to ""Boogie Nights"", to ""Dogma"" it is very evident that such an impact has occurred.  When it comes to people, we say they will ""live forever"", in my mind this movie will be the same.10/10"
19/04/2020,5,"This is without a doubt, one of the finest movies ever made. It has an oscar winning script, great characters and some career performances from Jackson, Willis, Travolta and Thurman.This movie is so clever and well thought out. Some people find it confusing. Rubbish!. The structure of this film is one of the things which makes it so good and original. when put in chronological order, the story makes complete sense, the stucture is not a gimmick.The cast of this film is truly excellent. Travolta got nominated for best actor at the Oscars but lost out to Tom Hamks (who was truly deserving as forest gump but, IMO, not as much as Travolta was as Vincent). The character of Vincent is a scumbag but Travolta's performance makes him lovable and funny and likable. Sam Jackson also puts in a stunning performance (The scene in the diner is truly stunning acting).I could talk this film up all day but i wont. Just go see it and you'll see for yourself how films should be made."
17/04/2020,4,"There is just so much to say about this movie that I don't know where to start! I had no idea what I was ""in for"" when I went to see this movie.  I really hadn't seen the previews for it, and had read nothing about it at all. Usually, this is the best way for me to go into a movie...otherwise I have too many expectations.  Well, even if I *had* known something about Pulp, I don't think I would have expected what I got.  Not that I'm complaining.Pulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride wherever Tarantino feels like taking you.  And what a thrilling ride it is!  From the opening scene we're left scratching our heads wondering exactly where Quentin is going to lead us on this one.  Is it another Natural Born Killers?  Another Reservoir Dogs?  Although there are nods to his other films, as well as several others, Pulp Fiction stands on its own.  From shocking to downright hysterical...this movie has it all.  Samuel Jackson is incredible (although I'm quite partial to him anyway) as the Bible quoting Jules.  John Travolta is tremendous as Vincent and is purely delightful to watch as the story unfolds.  The cast could not have been more perfect and Tarantino brings the best out in each and every one of the actors and actresses.Is there excessive use of the ""f word""?  Well, sure.  But c'mon!  We're talking about ""gangsters"" here (not to mention the 20th century)...for reality sake the ""f word"" really has become a part of everyday language for many people.  Aside from that, it *is* a Tarantino film and, well, he's not exactly known for being a prude.Glorifying violence and drug use...   Oh boy, don't even get me started. The LAST impression I got from this movie was some sort of message stating: ""it's ok to do drugs and kill people"".  Ummm, no.  Ok ok, so there may be teenagers who see this, you say.  Well then here we go on the ""it's the movies fault that there are problems..."" tangent.  I'm not even going into that one.  Bottom line regarding the drug use and violence:  if you are *that* impressionable, you probably shouldn't be watching anything beyond a G-rated Disney movie...and even that is questionable.All in all, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic film.  With its fabulous acting, perfectly cast crew, and hilarious moments, Pulp is one thrill after another.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to see it for what it is and can focus on the movie...not the bits and pieces taken waaaay out of context.  10 out of 10 stars."
16/04/2020,4,"This film may play with its use of chronology, and it may be episodic, but people generally claim this movie to be great because it is the first to do so. It is certainly not the first film to do either of these things. It is inspired by many films before it, such as Rashomon - which tells the same story from four different perspectives - as well as ""My Life to Live,"" a neorealist film which is told in twelve distinct episodes. However, Pulp Fiction was the first film to play with chronology in this manner in many years, and it is because it does so with great purpose which helps to make it my favorite movie (among various other reasons).Some complain about this fiddling with chronology to cause confusion, yet the story only goes out of the linear time line in two spots in the film, and I always found it easy to follow. As for the BIG episodes in the film (the ones Tarantino actually gave titles to) the first two are played in chronological order, and the third episode shown jumps back to a spot before the other two stories. I will not got too in depth with my next comment as it would give too much away if I did, but Tarantino's choice to show Butch Coolidge's story (Bruce Willis) before Jules' story (Samuel L Jackson) has a huge impact on the way the audience views Vincent Vega (John Travolta) by the end of the film. It is this fact combined with the way Jules' story ends that left me mind-blown when I watched this film for the first time.I understand that in the context of 1994 when this film was released that it was an extremely violent film. If you're still going to complain about the violence in this film today, I would laugh and tell you there is no way you could handle more contemporary films like Mongol, 300, or Gone Girl. Hell, I hope you can make it through Django Unchained, Tarantino's most recent and by far his most violent film to date. What people forget to say about the violence in Pulp Fiction is that most of it actually happens off screen, leaving the violence up to the audience's imagination (maybe this is why people remember it to be more violent than it actually is).What I realized and loved about this film after watching it for a few times is that the three stories of this film all have a common connection - they deal with loyalty to a father figure, each one more intimate than the last. We have Vincent Vega struggling to be loyal to Marsellus Wallace (the crime boss), we have Butch Coolidge honoring his father, and we have Jules Winnfield rethinking his relationship with God.Other than the chronology of the film, what is easily the most notable thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. Tarantino has arguably written better scenes after this film (in fact, I agree with his choice of the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds as his favorite thing he has written), but this is the movie by Tarantino that EVERYBODY quotes, especially the famous scene when Jules dominates the conversation about breakfast and what Marsellus Wallace looks like (trust me, even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably heard a friend quoting this scene). Tarantino is a master of dialogue - he writes conversations that people might actually have with each other. The topics may seem random, but that's how real-world conversations work. You discuss events, make analogies, disagree and argue - you don't simply talk about what is going to happen or what has happened, which is unfortunately how a lot of dialogue in film goes. Tarantino always creates distinct and well-developed characters through his use of dialogue.This movie is a roller coaster of an experience, and it gets my highest rating.4.0/4.0"
16/04/2020,4,"There is a world of many, many motion pictures, from Roundhay Garden Scene in 1888, to the films of Charlie Chaplin, Ingmar Bergman, to the Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind, and Casablanca. There is Titanic and Terminator, there is Night of the Living Dead and Gigli. There is The Godfather and Space Jam. In a world of several hundreds of thousands of movies, the most familiar and yet still original is Pulp Fiction.Perhaps life long cinephilia breeds a great filmmaker? Perhaps ""veteran"" actors are better than more contemporary actors? Perhaps dialog can be one of the most memorable parts of a film? While only a handful of films top Pulp Fiction in terms of quality, and craft, at 154 minutes, it remains cool, cocky, and deeper than what is led on during the first viewing.Not telling you about the plot is probably best for those unfamiliar with it. To call it a film with out a message is incredibly arrogant. Reading between fairly thick lines is a story about human redemption and choices. No mainstream movie maker has attempted what Tarantino does here.The characters are interesting, along with the acting in terms of greatness, and deep, along with the dialog, cinematography, storyline, and direction. Compared to Tarantino's Jackie Brown, it is very in your face, in a good way. You'll actually get to appreciate movies more after you see Pulp Fiction.The violence presented in minimalist, and very tastefully done. But best of all, it is, well, cool. It leaves me feeling shaken, like a powerful wave comes over me.Don't go in with any expectations however, experience it pure. Then you realize how fantastic it truly is. My hat's off to you, Quentin Tarantino, and if you haven't seen this movie already, see it. Twice."
15/04/2020,4,"Pulp Fiction in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all-time.  I really don't understand why many people claim it to be one of the greatest movies ever.  It's cruel, stupid, idiotic.  It's full of violence & f-words to the point that it's sickening.  It's like, let's get a couple of guns, a couple of f-words, a couple of murders and let's combine them to make a movie.  I hated everything about it.  EVERYTHING.  To me, all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames.  So the scenes were not in chronological order, big deal.  That doesn't make it a masterpiece.  This is hollywood garbage. There are some scenes that are sick.  The movie is SICK.  This is my review. I gave it a 2/10 just because the actors are respected.  Everything else is idiotic."
13/04/2020,4,"Always a phenomenal experience especially the music and extremely well done acting! On par with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Kill Bill - Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies ever made! The scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta are so damn good plus the suspense bits give me goosebumps in the best way possible. The few parts with comedy are superbly marvelous, I'd love to be a famous writer one day even if its not as genius as Quentin Tarantino - He's top notch."
12/04/2020,4,"It is very sad for me to see such an awful, immoral movie on any top list. Much less number 19.  This high rating shows how desensitized the world had made us.  That people would rave over a movie that shows a man raping another man, that uses the f-word 200 times in the first 10 minutes, that shows what is supposedly pieces of a man's head splatter in a car, and that shows people overdosing on drugs, is very, very disturbing, disheartening, and sickening.  There was no redeeming value to this movie.  It was awful and should not have been given a rating R, or, for that matter, have ever even been released to view.  I guess if you are morbid and over 30, they should have rented it to you, but no one under 30, and certainly no one under 21, should have been able to see this movie.  I was sixteen when I saw it, and I was appalled.  I was not impressed by the colorful display of language, drugs, sexual immorality, or violence in this movie.  They should have created a new rating for this movie, no one with any type of morals should see this movie, whatever letter that would be.  To see this movie, and see the high rating, shows me why there are so many murders every year... and why there are school shootings."
12/04/2020,4,"Read the external reviews, like Ebert's or Barardinellis', if you want to know more about ""content"" of Pulp Fiction. Following is my personal take on the film.Many have praised this film for ""interweaving 3 different stories."" Ever watch the TV series ""Northern Exposure?"" Every episode consists of 3 different, interwoven stories, and done much better than Tarentino does here. What this film does well is poke fun at the gangster movies, and does it with very witty writing. I especially liked the way these sordid characters got into various ""philosophical discussions"", like why in France a quarter-pounder cannot be called that, because of the metric system. Or why Jackson's character would not eat pork, because it is a dirty animal.To really enjoy this film, you have to numb yourself to all the filthy language and the gratuitous violence. However, it is neither an innovative film nor one with lasting meaning. That is why I rate it 5 of 10, and only that high because of the clever screenplay and direction.That reflects my own preference in movies. I give my highest ratings to such films as ""Longitude"", ""Nixon"", ""Apollo Thirteen"", ""Amistad"" - films based on great true stories. Or just entertaining but inoffensive ones like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Matrix"". Or thought-provoking ones such as ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""American History X"", ""Lone Star"", or ""Good Will Hunting"".I give low ratings to such films as ""The Game"", ""The Usual Suspects"" - films which on the surface seem to dazzle, but in final analysis simply try to fool us into thinking they are something special. I don't think ""Pulp Fiction"" exactly does this, but its fans have given it high praise that I'd bet even its creator would hesitate to do."
10/04/2020,4,"Sorry to degrade from the structure of how things go, but this is a hybrid between a review and a defense of the film.As far the movie itself, I could be locked in a room for a few weeks with it. It's what movies where made for. It is entertainment- sure and simple. I'm not gonna dive really into what the movie tries to do, because I see that more as a viewer's perspective. I can say, however, that whatever it it tries to do it does well. The acting, the dialogue, and everything else about it is gripping. The most overarching thing about it to me, though, is the absurdity. The absurdity is concocted at just the right angle so as to create a strange world, but one we can dwell our minds in. Reality itself is absurd in itself, is it not? This is what particularly draws me into this movie, and makes me like it so much.This is also the reason I think a lot of people hate it. The main insults toward the film regard it's ""lack of plot,"" ""lack of core,"" and ""lack of meaning, or anything at all."" Did I miss some section of the Geneva Convention that mandated how a movie had to be made? Yeah, typically a more linear and mountain shaped plot/ story line give that feeling of satisfaction at the end, but leave that to other movies. There are plenty to spare.People accuse it of being hollow as far as spirituality and meaning go. I find this kind of funny and ironic because I think that is exactly how it emphasizes these two subjects. The interactions and experiences of the characters in this absurd reality are what make it so real. We really don't have lives much different from Vincent and Jules. We're all figuring it out as we go, , under pressure of constantly changing circumstances, making decisions for ourselves in a place where we don't have much direction.If you can't find in this movie what others do, I guess you just aren't catching with them. It's really a matter of choice. These are all things that make Kurt Vonnegut novels what they are. Lack of tangency with seemingly pointless digressions. But that is what makes them brilliant. They place a film on life to view it with a new perspective. It's up to you how much value and entertainment there is in something like that."
09/04/2020,6,"I watched this back in the day and thought it was overrated then. Weirdly shot cinematography and random scenes with random dialogue. And if you like movies with no resolution after over 2 1/2 hours, then you will love this. And every few seconds of the badly written dialogue is bad language to prove how ""real"" these characters are.I tried to watch again to think maybe I missed something the first time around. Maybe Travolta can all of a sudden act and maybe Samuel L. Jackson won't just yell his dialogue. And maybe just maybe there will be resolution of what is in the briefcase. Instead of the satisfying Seven resolution, it still does not resolve. The movie looks VERY dated. It is still random. It looks like a movie shot for under $10 million. Still the most overrated movie of all time. Period."
09/04/2020,6,"I love film, and the magic of being transferred into another place and/or another time.  I like being able to see life through the eyes of someone else.  Everyone has their own interpretation, and this film is Quentin Tarintino's view on life.  There are a large group of people out there who follow Tarintino's career and praise his genious and mastery at story-telling.  I am not one of them!To me, Pulp Fiction was a horrible film!  I thought the plots were boring, I thought that the movie was a waste of time, and I feel that way about everything that Tarintino has put out!  All he does is recycle the same garbage over and over, and the public praises him for it.  From my perspective, the only thing that I see in the film that I would consider an original idea about this film is the manner in which the story was presented (ie the sequence of events being presented as they were.)  However, if you really want to see a great and unique approach at story-telling, watch Memento!What it all boils down to is that I don't believe that Quentin Tarintino is any better a director than Britney Spears is an actress; but that's just my opinion!I Rate - * 1/2"
08/04/2020,6,"The 90's was one of the best decades for movies, rivalling the 70's as my favorite. And this movie is perhaps the quintessential 90s movie. The mood, the actors, the comeback of Travolta, the coolnes of Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and of course, Samuel L. Jackson. It's just one of these movies you can watch over and over and over again. Everytime it came on when I was flipping through channels, when that was a thing, I ended up watching it till the end from that point. Every scene is a delight. And the music, man, the music is perfect to a tee!Maybe the best Tarantinofilm, and that is saying a lot. And the movie that really put him on the map, after the low budget ""Reservoir Dog"" made him a young director to watch. And watch him we have. Set the tone for what was the 90s movies. He copied and lend so much from other films, and so many films tried to copy him, but there is nust one Tarantino. And only one ""Pulp Fiction"". It's just perfect!"
08/04/2020,6,"Must See!! Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a film-goer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hit-man. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the disappointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product"
07/04/2020,6,This will always be a classic for me I love it so much. I watch this at least twice a day lol. The acting was superb and I have always been a fan of all of the characters since I was a teen.
07/04/2020,6,"Tarantinos' authentically brilliant masterpiece perfectly executing a film that is raw and ""lurid"" is both visually and mentally spectacular. The films writing is so original and the way the story line progresses and finally finishes is so perfectly fitted to the title. As with many of his films, the dialogue and soundtrack were both leading points. The dialogue was engaging and witty whilst building characters at a great pace. The humour was spot on evoking laughs at the most inappropriate times which I loved. The soundtrack, spectacular, and what I believe is a major reason the film became the cult classic it did. Perfect for every scene. The leads Travolta and L. Jackson had standout performances, however all performances were great. Tarantino has done an excellent job at creating an authentic and raw film, giving the impression of a rough and unfinished first edit, whilst keeping you entertained and glued to the screen for every minute. 10/10."
04/04/2020,6,"Every once in a while, a film comes along that changes everything. Whenever the industry went out of ideas & employed the same formula for too long, there always emerged a new wave of films that injected new life into this medium and in the process ended up changing the way we are accustomed to watching & perceiving motion pictures. And Pulp Fiction is, without a doubt, one of those movies.Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes & Best Screenplay at Oscars, Pulp Fiction was a force to be reckoned with at its time of release for it opened many realms that were previously thought to be non-existent and in the long run, didn't just influence cinema but other media as well. Everything about it was different from the norm and it remains one of the most original & groundbreaking stories to ever unfold on the silver screen.Pulp Fiction intertwines three different story lines into one and is told in a nonlinear fashion. The first follows two hit men who are out to retrieve a mysterious suitcase which belongs to their boss. The second is about one of those two hit men who's put in charge of taking care of the boss' wife while he's out of town. And third concerns an aging but proud boxer who is asked to drop a fight in exchange for a handsome reward. The lives of these odd people collide in unexpected ways, resulting in some hilarious situations.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, his sophomore effort is even better than his debut feature which was a milestone in itself. Tarantino has injected the script with extensive pop culture references, a vast line-up of idiosyncratic characters & explosive dialogues plus the way this whole story is narrated and its wicked fusion of violence & humour turns it into an endlessly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly refreshing ride that's in a league of its own.What's also amazing is the fact that most of the conversations taking place in the movie is not even related to the plot and is simply a casual discussion on a randomly chosen topic. And yet, without these wisecracking moments, Pulp Fiction wouldn't really be Pulp Fiction. The amount of focus that went into the smallest of details during the writing process is this film's biggest strength and when it comes to pure screenplay wizardry, Pulp Fiction has no equals & probably never will.The technical aspects are no slouch for the picture exhibits a number of new tricks when it comes to bringing the script to life on the film canvas. Cinematography presents Tarantino adding a few more photography techniques to his sleeve that would later become his own trademarks. Editing intentionally rearranges the order in which the events unfold and keeps the viewers on their toes at all times. And the soundtrack is a compilation of rock n roll, pop & surf music that are cleverly chosen and surprisingly fit the accompanying sequences.Two key elements that are highly contrasting in general but, in Tarantino's films, fit together as if co-dependent on each other is violence & humour. He's a rare artist who is capable of making us laugh uncontrollably at a scene that involves a person's head getting blown-off. Now there is substantial amount of violence in this picture but those violent sequences are also its funniest moments and the reason why it works so well is coz the addition of hilarity to such brutality significantly neutralizes the effect gore & violence alone may have had on the audience.Coming to the acting department, Pulp Fiction features a star-studded cast in John Travolta ,Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, & many more, and is notable for launching & revitalising the careers of many. Travolta resurrects himself with a smashing performance in the role of Vincent Vega. Jackson not delivers his career-best work but ends up reincarnating himself for this is the movie that made Samuel L. Jackson what Samuel L. Jackson is today and he will forever be indebted to Tarantino for this.Both Travolta & Jackson play the two hit men and their chemistry just clicks. Thurman plays Mia Wallace and is absolutely electrifying in her given role. Marsellus Wallace is a character whose presence looms over the entire story even during his absence & Ving Rhames didn't disappoint in portraying him. Willis adds another feather to his acting range and does nicely in balancing the toughness of his boxer character with a soft spot for his wife. Keitel steals every moment he is in. Roth & Plummer also have their moments to shine, and each one of them succeeds in bringing these scripted characters to life in just the right dose.On an overall scale, with its surprisingly powerful combination of unconventional structure, stylish direction, remarkable screenplay, stellar performances, energetic pace, mesmerising soundtrack and Tarantino's patented mix of violence & humour, Pulp Fiction succeeds as a delicious piece of pop culture that thrills & amuses in a highly unusual manner and is rightly counted amongst the greatest movies ever made. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, an unsurpassed milestone in independent filmmaking, and a landmark moment in cinema history that permanently engraved Tarantino's name in the annals of filmmaking, Pulp Fiction is essential viewing in every sense of the word. Multiple viewings advised."
03/04/2020,5,"What a great movie. Deserves all of the praise it gets. I might be saying this because I am a dude but this is one of the best movies of all time. Wonderfully paced, classic scenes, classic lines, and great performances from Jackson, Travolta, Thurman, Keitel, Rhames, Willis and not such a great performance from Tarantino. My favorite chapter has to be the Bonnie Situation purely because of Harvey Keitel as the Wolf."
02/04/2020,5,"Quentin Tarantino had done it again. If you thought he would just be an one day fly after ""Reservoir Dogs"", you couldn't be more wrong.Once again just like in ""Reservoir Dogs"" the storytelling is unique. The movie has several different story lines that are all in some way connected and to make the story even more complicated, they are not told in the right order. It sound like the story is hard to follow, how ever this is not the case. The story is easy to follow, so everybody should be able to see the brilliance of it.The movie is filled with sex, drugs, violence and bad language. All of this combined makes the movie one of the most kick butt movies.All of the stories are great and wonderfully written. It's amazing to see how they are connected. The stories are not typically Hollywood like, meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules. What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues. The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to, they are very raw and realistic, just like the characters. Brilliant dialogue!There are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history.The movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood.There is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Phil LaMarr, Frank Whaley, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken. Having such a cast is already a signal that this is more than just an ordinary movieA must see unique movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
31/03/2020,2,"It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture. It's an important film and no doubt one of the most important ones to have come in the last 20 years. Not many films, threatened to change the rules of the game, as this film did. In terms of writing, it's non-linear, now non-linear in the real sense, it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either, but they are connected by characters. This film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget. Like that, adrenalin shot scene to Mia (Uma Thurman) or reciting Bible's Eziekel 25:17 by Jules (Samuel Jackson).Though, it's nearly 2 and hours, its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered. So, is Vincent dead or not? What is there in that briefcase to Marseilles? And these are left unanswered. With just 7 scenes, you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in it's own way the perspective of the audience. So, I am amazed more than anything even as I watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time I see this. There is something that always works in PULP FICTION. But, what makes this film work is it's writing. It's writing like madness, there is no proper thing called this is it. It can be referred to anything and you may be right. The righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character. If I want to write one favourite scene here, it's gonna be the whole movie coz I like everything in it. Technically, I like the cinematography, sound design and costumes. But above all, I liked performances and dialogues. Thanks to Quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else. But for me, this is is my favourite Quentin film and I will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this.A sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films, no less ever."
30/03/2020,2,"The title of the movie tells you exactly what the movie is - Pulp Fiction.I've seen a lot of crime movies, I don't think I've ever seen one that doesn't have a single police officer in the entire movie.This movie features 2 extremely bizarre days in the life of two hit men, a boxer, and a crime boss's wife.The characters and dialogue are extremely well written, and the soundtrack is amazing."
27/03/2020,2,"Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. . Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."
26/03/2020,2,"As with most Tarantino movies, each time you watch it it seems a bit different. Now, I don't't think that it's the best movie ever and I don't think that everybody has to like it, because it can easily be disliked. What I don't understand is this- Why does this film have such a bad reputation. Just think this over, please, all of you people who wail and complain about how horribly violent it is.How on earth are you so isolated as to think that this is the most violent movie out there? Have you not seen any movies since 1994? Because believe me, this movie could practically slide by with a PG-13 today (well not really) But honestly, if you don't like the move, then sure, fine, you don't like it, but why would you attack it's content when there are so many other movies that are MUCH more violent?"
26/03/2020,2,"despite my initial dislike of this movie, i have changed my opinion regarding 'pulp fiction' for a very particular reason. two people, john travolta and uma thurman, better be kissing q. Tarantino's bootie in appreciation for what he was done for their careers. obviously uma thurman is worthy of her role as muse, but the work she did in this movie was so strong it made it impossible for people to dismiss her as just another ridiculously beautiful face. john travolta had all but resorted to used car lot opening's when his role in this movie thrust him back in the spotlight. OK, i'm not as thrilled about this, but still, we got uma."
26/03/2020,2,"That was to lower it's stupid ridiculously high average, but to put it quite simply, I hated this movie. I didn't expect to like it, I was only watching it for Frank Whaley, but I hated this movie, really hated with it with it's various plot holes that do not make sense(watch ""Short Cuts"" if you want to see a decent movies about the interrelating lives of people), obnoxious, unsympathetic characters(I wanted to cheer when John Travolta died, or did he die? I had no idea since the film epitomized non-sense making. Someone died, and I didn't like any of the characters, with the exception of Whaley's, so I would still have wanted to cheer), bad writing, with obvious attempts at being ""cool"" and trying to have ""catch phrases,"" etc etc etc! I found nothing good about this film in the least. So why did critics? I hate when violent, immoral films are regarded as ""daring"" ""good"" film making. This one sure wasn't, and nominating John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson for acting awards?! The first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act, but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious. This one is up there with ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Do the Right Thing"" for my least favorite ""good"" movie."
15/03/2020,2,"This movie is ass and doesn't deserve the critical acclaim that the other reviews is giving it. I thought Vin Diesel really sucked as that boxer sucked, and i thought they should have used The Rock instead. Also it was a huge stepdown from the other Travolta classics. This movie definitely should not be watched by anyone in the future."
25/02/2020,8,"I can't see what people see in this movie. I did not like it because it is violent for violence's sake and unless you think that is funny, it is not interesting. Another movie from Quentin Tarantino that is just crude. Pulp says it all. The writing is clever. I won't deny that. The cast is good. What a waste of talent. To put a movie like this on a pedestal is a sad commentary on our times. It is hard to identify most of the characters unless you are a criminal type. It seams in order to make a ""GREAT"" movie all you have to do is put as much violence, sex and the F word as you can and people will laud you. There is no redeeming value in this movie."
22/02/2020,8,"This movie is seriously over rated. There was nothing so special about the movie plot. The story was okay type also this movie was a bit lengthy than it should be so it made the plot more boring. I don't know why people are finding this movie so good, I watched this because it was high rated and I had some mind-blowing expections but the movie is 'in my opinion' not 8.9 imdb type"
20/02/2020,8,"I must have seen this movie about 7 times! I remeber the first time I was a little lost, but that is because I was not paying attention to it, and everyone who has seen it, told me, you have to pay attention to every single scene and detail. I watched it the second time and I LOVED it. I totally got it and loved it so much, I had to watch it again. You really do have a lot going on in this movie and it is worth watching still!!"
19/02/2020,8,"Pulp Fiction: Quentin Tarantino's second film. Is it just as rich and mighty as Reservoir Dogs? Yes. This time, a budget and a cast come along for the ride, a ride that's chopped up into four stories circling a handful of people. There's a mob boss, the mob boss's wife, a boxer, a pair of raucous gangsters and a couple who resemble the contemporary Bonnie and Clyde. Now, you need to look at Pulp Fiction as an adaptation of a comic, and less as a linear story. There's no broad plot, only a smattering of small stories linking the oddballs on display. Surprisingly its style works wonders. Its cool, edgy, bombastic and just as outrageous (if not more) as Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman make the biggest impact with personalities hard to beat. The dialogue is heavy, but witty and clever, the soundtrack glorious and the movie is wrought with memorable scenes. Mentionable moments include Thurman and Travolta's dancing, Jackson's reciting of a passage from the bible, and Travolta's accident. Tarantino proves that his first attempt at filmmaking wasn't a lucky one."
17/02/2020,8,"This movie is amazing. it's non linear-timeline was what put it to the top of the box office and if your the kind of guy who's after an alternate brand of film, this is what you are looking for. Pulp Fiction is the film that made multiple-time-framed, non linear gangster movies (after Resevoir Dogs) which has been inspired by a number of present hits including Lock,Stock; Usual Suspects AND Out of Sight. 10/10"
16/02/2020,8,"This is the kind of movie where the viewer becomes completely transfixed in what's happening on screen. Like the addictive Sopranos, we're also drawn into the lives of underworld hit men, drug dealers and zany characters.If you enjoy watching the Sopranos, you'll get a kick out of Pulp Fiction hoping to see Tony Soprano, as the plot unfolds. The storytelling skills of Quentin Tarantino shine throughout this film. It's rich in characters and metaphors throughout.By the end, if you've paid attention throughout, will you finally understand what the glowing object is or will it remain, forever, a mystery?"
15/02/2020,8,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."
09/02/2020,8,"I picked this movie up from the video store and watched it last night. I mostly got it hearing that it was a great, one of the best movies of the nineties. I have to say I was let down. Yes, it was a very intriguing piece of fluff (considering it was about violence). I mostly found it very funny at times, the way these mean gangsters act like regular people. For example, Vincent and Jules are calmly discussing the level of intimacy a foot massage implies right before they go inside an apartment with guns to teach some twenty-somethings a lesson. However, when all is said and done I felt as if there should have some point to the movie. The only characters who evoked any sympathy were minor characters. I will confess I totally loved ""The Bonnie Situation"" sequence, but it was way too short in comparison with some of the rest of the movie. I wish the whole movie was that light-hearted or had expanded the story out for two hours. On the other hand, I was almost bored during the story about Vincent taking Mia to the restaurant. Overall, it was a good movie, but the quality changes throughout."
04/02/2020,8,"This movie was alright, I mean I understand it but maybe I just don't ""get"" it. It's a pastiche (which is a fancy word for a positive, nostalgia like satire) of pulp crime movies. Okay. That's a fine premise but the rest of the movie does not compute. I enjoyed the circular and completeness of the plot but it's strange when considered in light of the characters and the themes. I think far too many people take this movie at face value, and that value is a little disappointing. I enjoyed all the actor's performances and undeniably this movie has set a genre and a wealth of movie clichés. But it's overlong and cringe-worthy at points. I just don't think it's a classic."
01/02/2020,8,"I can't really think of one thing I didn't like about this movie. Everything from the costumes the sets, make up, hair, acting, writing, directing and editing. All the best of the best. Amazing work! PulpFiction, I must admit, is a stellar piece of cinema. A literally star-studded cast portrays the characters beautifully, making you feel their joy and pain. Plot wise, there are numerous twists and turns, as to be expected, but they all manage to fit together rather nicely. And while some things do remain unexplained or unaccounted for in the end, it doesn't leave the viewer wanting. Dialogue in this movie is particularly delightful, with much reverence to dark humor and double-talk (not unlike the film Lucky Number Slevin). Ultimately the scenes I really like were with Uma Thurman. I think Tarantino delivered a solid piece worthy of the place it's earned in the upper echelons of most critics' ""top 10""."
28/01/2020,8,"One of the most stylish Crime films I have ever seen. It is really up there with Tarrntino's ""Reservoir Dogs."" Tough and gritty but not  pointless like some crime glamorizing films. It does not glamorize hitmen nor does it glamorize drugs in the least bit. Ten points for this Flick."
24/01/2020,8,"When a previously unknown young filmmaker named Quentin Tarantino barged onto the movie-making scene in 1992 with a unique, quirky, disturbing and groundbreaking film called Reservoir Dogs, a noticeable change could already be seen soon after in the film industry on the whole. Cheap imitations of Tarantino's hit began to be seen, films with more stylized dialogue, harsher senses of humour usually coupled with brutal violence became much more commonplace and acceptable in the mainstream cinema. (a prime example being Tony Scott's 1993 hit ""True Romance"", also written by Tarantino) Yet if Reservoir Dogs was a hit, than Pulp Fiction was something entirely more, snatching up the prestigious Palme D'Or award at the Cannes film festival and making a huge smash impact on movie viewers and the film industry on the whole, spawning generations of cult followers and would be imitators. Despite the relentless praise Tarantino and his most prized film have been awarded, upon viewing over a decade later, Pulp Fiction still manages to intrigue and fascinate, with its blinding originality of narrative, and wonderfully convoluted screenplay. No matter how terrible or disgusting the myriad of characters on display here, we never fail to be utterly fascinated by them, and after the movie has run its two and half hour course, we are left only wanting more darkly comical and fiendishly interesting pulp tales to feast our eyes and ears upon. One also remarks on how deeply the movie has permeated modern pop culture simply by noticing all of the scenes that are referenced, whether it be by the Simpsons, Saturday Night Live or other movies, such scenes as the 50s dance scene with Travolta and Thurman,the ""you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in France?"" scene with Jackson and Travolta and Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames being bound and gagged by red rubber balls, only by seeing the movie will one truly understand how often it is referenced by so many sources. The movie truly defines the meaning of the term ""ensemble cast"" as well, with superb and incredibly memorable performances all around. John Travolta is great as spaced out, almost child like Vincent, who seems constantly on a different page as all surrounding him in the role that single-handedly re-ignited his career, and breakout star Samuel L. Jackson is similarly terrific as his partner with a tendency for religious rants, fully deserving their Oscar nominations. Tarantino favourite Uma Thurman is also terrific as a spoiled mobster's wife, and Bruce Willis gives an excellent, engaging performance as 40s style boxer Butch. Then there's the myriad of excellent supporting players, with such familiar faces as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Amanda Plummer, Tarantino himself... even a tiny cameo from an unrecognizable Steve Buscemi as Buddy Holly the waiter in the wonderful 50s dance club scene, and Christopher Walken delivering his utterly unforgettable monologue, one of the best and most memorable of all time. All in all, it goes without saying that Pulp Fiction is a modern classic of film-making, and despite all of the hype and endless praises, one still walks away from it remarking on how unique and wonderful a film it is. For those not deterred by the strong violence, frequent swearing and racial slurs that tend to be Tarantino trademarks, Pulp Fiction should qualify as a ""must see"", if only to understand all of the references in modern pop culture and see what everyone is talking about. Rest assured you will almost certainly not be disappointed. -10/10"
19/01/2020,8,"Tarantino's masterpiece, is as so many other movies, far more then the sum of its parts. Completely disjointed and unrelated stories that come together to form one whole that is a wonderfully told story. This movie would have fallen flat had it not been for the amazing cast and Tarantino's fantastic script. While some of the dialog is completely random its also what gives the movie its wonderful depth while still retaining its simple nature.The cast of characters are great and filled with personality, but what really makes them come to life is the amazing actors portraying each character. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson both deliver stellar performances and play perfectly off of each other. Bruce Willis plays his character to perfection in what I would consider possibly the best performance of his career. Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames both have very strong and great performances as well, but the first three are who really shine in this film.Pulp Fiction is also the landmark movie for non-linear story telling. What Tarantino tried in Reservoir Dogs he perfected in Pulp Fiction. Its probably the inspiration for most if not all of today's modern non-linear films. Among Tarantino's many great films this is by far his best. Pulp Fiction is a masterfully done and brilliantly simple movie that was is and will always be remember as one of the best films of all time."
17/01/2020,8,"I agree totally with the people here who have said, among other things, that Pulp Fiction is gratuitously violent, morally corrupt, and designed to appeal to hormonally imbalanced young males. I first saw it when it came out in 1994 and as I watched, couldn't understand why the other people in the room (my friend and her parents) were not outraged like I was. One of the more horrifying scenes that will always stand out in my mind is where a young black man is murdered and then his body dumped into the boot (trunk) of a car like a discarded shop mannequin. All this, supposedly in the name of 'art'.People say life doesn't imitate art but I disagree. How many kids saw Harry Potter and then went home and pretended to be wizards? Of course people are influenced by art, and even if they are not influenced directly, the overall sentiment or message will often leech it's way under the skin. So what kind of message are we sending out about how we treat human beings with movies like this? Why is spraying bullets into someone's head and then making jokes about how their blood will be cleaned out of the car their body has been dumped in something we want to put on film?It worries me that Tarentino knew he'd have a market for this kind of movie; Obviously, some of us want to see a movie like this ... disturbing, I believe.No amount of sophisticated direction or stylization can be used to justify this kind of travesty. Quentin Tarentino, you ought to be truly ashamed of yourself. Too unworthy to even rate."
13/01/2020,8,"Sorry you QT worshippers. This film first of all was no Reservoir Dogs, and second of all, doesn't have the edge or guts of ""Fight Club"" or ""American History X"", for example.This is a ""tour-de-FORCED"", ""I'm-so-full-of-my-self"", pant-load of a movie. Calculated hit for the ""I'm-so-full-of-my-self"" yuppie-money-punk crowd, who think they are ""HIP"" and ""COOL"" because they connect with ""The Street"".Analogy:""Pulp Fiction"" is to ""Reservoir Dogs"" as ""Oceans 11"" is to The GetawayThis film is a Tarantino Ego Trip that merits no higher, in my humble though strong opinion, no higher than a ""5""."
25/12/2019,8,"I rent the film because the fact that it's #9 on IMDb 250 list and my friend highly recommend the film. So I watched it last night, I couldn't believe my eye, what a piece of garbage film-making this is, the whole film is mostly consist of boring & cheesy dialaue in which have at least a million F word in it. the character sucked, I never felt I care about them. And the worst thing is that there's not motherfreaking plot! I watched the whole film and did not understand what the hell is going on. I cannot think of any positive things about this film.And why is this film loved by many and get thumb up from the critics? Here's some of my theory: 1. this is a very unique film for its time, so people get on a bandwagon and start praise this film, so whoever hate this film would considered ""uncool"" 2. Pulp Fiction is so bad that it's good. As mention before, pulp fiction is a unique film, it's so unique that it's hard to tell that it's good or bad, but the critics decided to call it good, soon a bandwagon start.the bottom line is, do not watch this film, don't care about what other people say. If this comment doesn't convince you to stay away from this film, then go to page 5,6,7,8, there are other people who just hate this film as much as I do"
18/12/2019,7,"I like it, it was very good. Uma Thurman sexy as ever, Travolta and Jackson has a great dynamic and Willis is good too. I don't really understand the point of having three stories interwoven together like this, but it was kind of cool to see them overlap.Good film!"
17/12/2019,7,"Several independent little stories are subtly related to each other. Miao ~ A large section of the dialogue, try to see the original, because the sound processing is too beautiful"

A rating of 10 out of 10 is not just well-deserved praise but a recognition of great art."
13/12/2019,7,"Something so hilariously wholesome about the dialogue in this film. Talk about travel, food, the offensiveness of a foot rub... but also full of violence, drugs, and some blood. Super realistic shots of Uma ODing stuck with me. This was an enjoyable film with a pretty plain and raw film style. Lots of long shots to witness the chemistry between characters. Cool soundtrack too."
25/11/2019,10,"1994's pulp fiction is by far my favorite movie of all time. Both John Travolta and Sam L. Jackson, put on an outstanding performance. Pulp Fiction also has the best dialog i have ever heard in a movie. Even though this movie comes out as a series film, the script is surprisingly funny.Another good characteristic of this movie is that it is shown out of order, this makes the movie a lot better because the stories begin to overlap each other, explaining things that arn't explained the first time it is shown. Their are also a lot of good cameos/co-starts in this movie such as Bruce Willice, Uma Thurman, Harvey Kitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walkens, and Steve Buscemi although the movie is very violent and has a lot of profanity, it is a movie you can watch and enjoy over and over again."
21/11/2019,10,"An Incredible cast teamed with an incredible writer/director to make one of the most original films of the 90's. Film is actually 3 different stories intertwined together in some way throughout the movie.  I won't tell you the stories because you should go and see the movie...then see it again later in the week.  This movie was thought out to the very smallest detail by director Quentin Tarantino, which is why a first time viewer may seem lost. Although it's hard to say if this film was better than Forrest Gump, it definitely falls into the category of one of the most influencial, cool, and of course, BEST movies.Soundtrack kicks major tuckus too!"
14/11/2019,10,"The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. It is a little bit to long, but I can say it is Tarantino style to show everything in a little bit slow motion manner. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. 8/10"
02/11/2019,10,"Every once in a while a film is released that changes the face of cinema forever. Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" is one, ""The Godfather"" is another and of course there is ""Pulp Fiction"". What can you say about a film that 14 years later is often imitated but never quite duplicated? From inventive camera angles, non-linear story-telling, and snazzy dialogue, all of which are perfect examples of the film's attributes that are often attempted to be replicated but with little or no success. Today its cast members are all known stars in their own right but at the time were relative unknowns or were in a considerable rut in their careers. It was this film that made it where they pretty much can name their own ticket, and have.When people ask me, ""What is is about 'Pulp Fiction' that you like?"" I have to answer, ""It is better to to tell you what I don't like about it because the answer is shorter, and that answer is 'nothing' "". Why? Because the film is absolutely flawless. Intriguing, unassuming, characters that makes the experience all the more authentic. This coupled with a perfect script and polished acting make this perhaps the most entertaining crime drama of the 90's or of all time. It is just one of the jewels that make up the cinematic releases of, in my opinion, one of the greatest decades for movies up to date. Granted, ""Pulp Fiction"" is not for everyone but if you have a strong stomach and have a scrupulous officiousness towards the criminal underworld then this film is a must see."
22/10/2019,10,"This film has been picked over by critics, film students and general enthusiasts of the cinema since it's premier in October of 1994 and there's always so much to say about it. It remains one of the most off the wall, cult style films with such genuine and unforgettable personality.The premise of the movie spans a course of two days, which in reality feels more like a week and involve a hardy cast of characters, more notably the main characters: Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel Jackson) Marsellus Wallace and Mia Wallace (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). A series of crimes that intertwine the fates and connects all of these characters, has the flow of the film sending you back and forth through time in order to understand their involvement with each other. This gives the editing of the film such an original feel that has defined Director Quentin Tarantino's style as a filmmaker and given him such a massive following.The theme of the film is certainly crime and how it almost never pays, at least not for you. All of these characters find themselves on a crossroad of sorts, having to make drastic decisions that center around their involvement in criminal activities, whether it be robbing some college students or disposing of a body. Some take the higher road and find their salvation, while others fade out without ever taking the chance. The tone has an element of silliness to it but ultimately keeps its serious tone about gangsters doing gangster things.The dialog and writing as a whole remain this film's greatest strength as it allows the characters to become so much more believable and charismatic. Tarantino has always had an extraordinary talent for dialog and the voice he gives his characters, which you will see in any of his films (I recommend Kill Bill for this reason). The quotability of Pulp fiction is something else that any cinema fan has certainly noticed as the film has some of the more memorable lines from any of Tarantino's pictures up to that point. Being so entertained simply by spoken words is a solid sign of talented writing, a talent which Tarantino does not lack.The tone and style of Pulp fiction would inspire so many low budget and or indie films to come as well as a number of feature films, though it holds a specifically special place in cult film culture. This film will certainly remain a classic for any movie lover and a special film to share with newfound movie buffs."
04/10/2019,10,"When this first hit the scene in 1994 it secured Quentin Tarantino a place in cinema history. One of the most stylish and memorable films of all time, Pulp fiction is an imaginative masterpiece that stylishly unfolds 3 interwoven stories like never before.It is an outstanding achievement in film and a landmark in Tarantino's career. Superb performances throughout bring to life the already outstanding script to achieve near perfection. Tarantino's direction is perfect, and the script is one of the best to ever grace the cinema.It's a beauty of a film, one that took the conventions of film-making and spat on them to create an entirely new experience that you will never forget. If you haven't already seen it then you need to, its one of the best there is or ever will be. You've got to see it to believe it.10 out of 10"
03/10/2019,10,"Quentin Tarantino hit two home runs in his career as a Director. Reservoir Dogs was the first, and Pulp Fiction was the second. Everything that has followed has been poor, at best, in comparison.Not having the narrative play out in a linear fashion was a genius thing to do. It instantly engaged the audience with a sense of what the heck is going on, and as confused as some were by the end, it plays out brilliantly, whilst raising questions throughout.Following Pulp Fiction, the Director decided to just make films that he could have women's feet openly shown in close-ups for his own weird little fetish and the use of ""shock deaths"" seldom had any motivation behind them and were purely for shock value."
27/09/2019,10,"I think Pulp Fiction is one of the best films out there! I loved Kill Bill 1 and 2, and Reservoir, but wasn't as keen on Jackie Brown. I love this infantile humour Tarantino has in his films, from the accidental killing of Marvin, to the bewildered Vince and Butch. I love how the film is produced. The way the narrative is constructed or in a way re-constructed (in classical terms) is brilliant, and clever. It keeps with the kind of audience Pulp Fiction was made for; this television slob, who sits there and watches this ""rebel with a pause"" television- these are the type of ""heroes"" Tarantino loves. I don't really care about the plagiarism used in the film, or any film (inless its Van Helsing), i mean we see it every day in every film we see! No contemporary director has stood there on the set and thought ah yeah, no ones EVER done that before, because they get ideas from what they have seen in other films, i mean no one complains when The Simpsons do ""homages"" towards films like Battleship Potemkin, or Psycho, i mean The Simpsons paid ""homage"" to Tarantino 25 times! Honestly! Just shows hes better!"
27/09/2019,10,"I absolutely loved this movie. Quentin Tarantino's direction is amazing, as is his writing. Roger Avary deserves his writing props as well. John Travolta shows his talent in this film, proves once again that he is not just a savvy sorta heartthrob guy but also a talented actor. Vincet Vega remains one of my favorite theatrical characters of all time. Samuel L. Jackson is the actor who shines the most, spouting Bible verses and having revelations. Bruce Willis is also another who goes against what he has been categorized as (a brainless guy with a nice body) to what we all love him as in this movie (a witty guy with a nice body). Uma Thurman is not the prettiest in this movie, but her acting is great and she delivers the lines so well you can't tell she didn't write the movie. I love the plot and everything. Watch this if you haven't."
22/09/2019,10,"This movie is a masterpiece, in my opinion is the best movie of all time by far.Because of pulp fiction my love for cinema only increased, making me discover more and more excellent films and falling in love with the seventh art every day."
21/09/2019,10,"This movie was recommended to me by my Sister about a year after its release, it was the first Tarantino movie i had seen, and i have to be honest, it nearly passed me by. You know when you sit down to watch a movie and your minds somewhere else, well that was me the first time, and i could have missed out on a gem.Such was the recommendation from my sister, i actually went and hired it again, i don't think i pieced it all together properly on this viewing either, but i certainly recognised its quality, and quickly added it to my collection, and later bought it again on DVD.The Direction can only be described as masterful, the cast is simply perfect and each piece of the intertwining story was brilliantly written and played out. What else can be said, that hasn't been said before.10/10 Recommended to anyone who likes Tarantino, and to those who don't know his work, start with Kill Bill 1 & 2, then watch this. (This is better but Kill Bill is easier viewing)"
14/09/2019,10,"Pulp Fiction is the best movie made, EVER! Quentin Tarantino is the God of movie-maker. He made me open my eyes, and made me a movie-maniac! Every movie QT touches, becomes gold. He is the best! And I cant wait to see Kill Bill. If you have not seen Pulp Fiction; Go and get it! Buy it or rent it from a store (the best thing is to buy it, so you can see it over, and over, AND over again). You have nothing to loose, except that you'll maybe be stuck infront of the screen alot more!"
06/09/2019,10,"A complete masterpiece coming from the great Quentin Tarantino. Both the dialogues and the plot is amazingly interesting and well-written. Near-perfect performances from almost every actor (even brett is fabulous), arguably the best original screenplay ever written and great directing performance by tarantino. Simply a superb film that everyone must watch at least once in their lives."
01/09/2019,10,"Known as the film that launched Tarantino, brought Travolta out of obscurity, and turned Samuel Jackson and Uma Thurman into stars, it could be hard to posit an effective review for this off the wall crime caper. Maintaining a low key, low budget look; surely an homage to the noirs and cheesy grind house flicks Quentin grew up with, this dialogue driven, drug and violence fueled flick is largely blessed with a career defining performance from Samuel L. Jackson, turning many of his subsequent roles into a retread or half parody of this one. Mob hitmen Jules and Vincent aim to retrieve a stolen briefcase for their boss Marsellius Wallace, whose wife Vincent takes out for an infamous night of dancing while the boss is away. Meanwhile Butch, a boxer well past his prime is paid to take a fall. It's so over the top that is somehow all works, and your enjoyment largely rests on how much you enjoy the raparte and kitsch style of the acting. Luckily they pull it off with style and a soundtrack that itself was a big seller. 90s cool in a can. Recommended."
31/08/2019,7,"This is Tarantino's true first born. Everyone who saw this movie felt compelled to see Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown..regardless of your opinion. Just as Taxi Driver & Raging Bull made people watch Mean Streets Unlike Tarantino, personally I'm not blindly devoted to Scorsese and won't say Taxi Driver and Mean Streats we're over my head..I believe they helped get to Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, and Wolf.
Sequencing and Narrative films(Narrative was mainstreamed by Scorsese with Ray Liota, Pecci & DeNiro in Casino & DeCaprio in Wolf). Tarantino uses Narrative in Both Kill Bill films and I'm the Hateful 8.
The other influence adjusted for audiences with a shorter attention Span was Leone..in terms of using Ennio Marricone..(John Williams has nothing on him)..and the pre-violence filming e.g. Uma's 1:1 Face Offs, the emergence of the Bear Jew to bash in the Nazi sergeants brains in etc..
I write this because I am surprised that the Biggest Goof is not mentioned anywhere and I'm surprised it took me so long to see it because it's so Glaring perhaps.
When the story line goes back to ""Bonnie's House and Vincent tell Jules to chill him out, one can clearly see the ""miracle bullet holes"" in the Wall behind Jules before the other kid comes in 5 feet away with the arm cannon and ""Shoots off 5 rounds that missed"" leading to their ""Metaphysical Discussion about Divine Intervention"""
20/08/2019,6,"I just felt like adding a comment although I've seen the movie like for 10 times and it was made over 5 years ago. Anyway, there's not much point in going into WHY Pulp Fiction is so great - everyone who's seen it, understands it. So I just wanted to say that it's one of the two movies that has got the ""Loved it"" rating from me at Moviecritic.com, alongside with Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant"". A movie the world (or at least mine) could not do without."
13/08/2019,6,"This is a movie that is tied with the Big Lewbowski for ""Most Enjoyable Over Repeat Viewings,"" if you ask me. Pulp Fiction is such an imaginative and densely plotted set of events that it really took me 3 or 4 rewatches before I began processing all the peculiar details that make up these odd characters.It's so entertaining that, if I believed such a thing existed, I would say it's the film to end all films. It might not be the absolute greatest film, the film that snobs bawl all over. But it may be the most entertaining.It isn't pretentious. It just is. The movie is so odd that it seems like fantasy, but it's also so riveted to an understanding of the real world and of real people. You actually want to hear what these characters have to say. You get an idea of who they are after they've barely said anything at all."
12/08/2019,6,"After 4 years, I still consider this the worst movie I have ever seen.  I have yet to watch any thing else with QT's name attached to it. Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all three departments miserably."
11/08/2019,6,"One of the best films ever. Tarantino's way of perfectly doing films is another level. Unique, it touches a lot of genres and makes you get really inside of it. All small details and how Tarantino can link stories , go back and foward on them in a easy way to understand and appreciate it. When i was in the university i made a study about pulp fiction and this was one of the greatest jobs i did in my whole graduation. Its hard to describe how well done tarantinos films are, not only pulp fiction but all of them. Definitely his job has upgraded how cinema is seen, how really great a master piece can be!"
09/08/2019,7,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Great movie overall! Nice."
06/08/2019,7,"Pulp Fiction did something that no other film had done at the time. Countless have mimicked it since, but only a few have even come close to succeeding. This was a breath of fresh air when it was first released and it continues to be a great watch time and time again. Perhaps the greatest film of all time. I give a perfect 10 out of 10 stars."
04/08/2019,7,"Pulp Fiction is a mess of a movie. Gratuitously violent and indulgent. Everyone wants to talk about the humour of going over a bump and someone being shot. How hilarious is that (this comment is meant to be ironic. I note this for the Hollywood saturated brain-dead).To call it a classic requires calls for major surgery on the definition. The film is really just a sign of a sick culture. Stay away from it. The irony wasn't lost on me. The problem is that it was of the sledge-hammer variety.There are so many good films that I am at a loss to see why this is chosen for special consideration. And to make matters worse, the editor on this programme insists I use American spelling. Goodness, get a life. Program with ""me"" on the end of it was still English last time I looked."
29/07/2019,9,"Why did people like this?Tiresome streams of pop-culture references?(""like kane in Kung Fu"" ""Elvis or Beatles? Brady Bunch or Hogan's Heroes? Buffy St. Marie or Dusty Springfield? Leo Sayer or Captain & Taneall?"")mundane out of context dialogue?(""wow this coffee sure is good. I didn't expect you to have such good coffee.  this is one mean cup of joe!"")Hip depictions of Drug Culture.?It's annoying bellyflop into the middle of the retro craze fashion herd?one dimensional characters pointing guns at each other's heads? (the cheapest, most half-assed, most cliched way to generate drama = person pointing gun at another person's head.  And yelling. over and over.)""cool"" sunglasses?Take these things out, and the movie still isn't very good. Leave them in and it's trendy and annoying.If you are a teenager and don't know anything about HK films, films from the 70s, or the 70s in general, are easily duped by hype, I urge you to see this movie. It was made for you!! It will TOTALLY BLOW YOU AWAY, MAN! Dude!"
23/07/2019,9,"Tarantino takes us through a journey of the postmodern abyss his characters are dropped in. You might retort this by saying I don't speak English, but frankly, I think I speak the new language. That's right, the new language of postmodernism. The language of a land where every character is a victim of subjectivism, where every time we want to look at the movie we peer to nothing whole. We only get sneak peeks of the performances of the actors and the landscapes and places they find themselves in. It never becomes a coherent whole. This is a movie that clashes with peoples' sense of what a movie should be. It's precisely a movie that shouldn't be. The ""incoherent"" story lines and ""pointless"" dialogues lead us to the same place. There is barely any change we just move in a circle. And there goes another confrontation to the modernist though: time is not linear, postmodernists say.Now, I doubt Tarantino has any idea what postmodernism is, since he's a filmmaker, not a philosopher, and I doubt you could consciously make a postmodernist film. But this is, without a doubt, the truer representation of our times: a bunch of characters lost in an urban hell, who interact with each other, something we think would be relevant to the storyline, but wasn't. There is no ulterior motive here, it's just a day in the life of a few assholes in a hellish L.A. Which looks remarkably average, not exceptionally detached from our experience.The dialogue is one contentious point with people who are used to dialogue leading somewhere. Dialogue doesn't lead anywhere in this case. It barely moves forward, except when it needs to move forward. Otherwise it just gets stuck in the same place, like real dialogue. This is not your average Hollywood drama. Tarantino liked to do this around this time. He liked subverting clichés. Now, his filmmaking style doesn't subvert clichés, because he has made his style a cliché. We know what to expect from a Tarantino film. But when Pulp Fiction came out, everyone was astounded. What's surprising is that people still are shocked by it, and still don't understand what the film is getting at.That's right, it's getting right at your preconceived notions of time and space. Other films along the same line are Fargo, Big Lebowski, Fight Club, anything by Iñárritu, and of course, the quintessential postmodern film, Breathless, by Jean Luc-Godard. Good art should be questioned. This movie raises a number of questions, not deep, philosophical tirades about existence, no. It raises the question of how we perceive ourselves in time and space, how we conceive of our place in the world. And like all postmodernist though, it provides no answers."
22/07/2019,9,"This movie has long been heard. I recently took the time to watch it. I It was a bit long. After watching the show, I found the movie a bit. Do not follow the routine. The plot is very exciting and fun"
19/07/2019,9,When watching Pulp Fiction for the first time in 1994 I felt confused but promised myself that I would watch it again when I was more mature & able to digest such a clever production. Recently I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed watching this film again & easily can put it in Tarantino's top 3 behind Reservoir Dog's & From Dusk Till Dawn. The film is clever in every way but especially the way it explores the past & present & how you develop a liking to Tarantino's characters who are killers & criminals. Each character is a hero in his or her own way & it is riveting viewing to find out what happens to them next in their individual story. So what's it missing? Not much besides that fact that it is a film that you need 'to watch' to understand it & it must be taken with tongue in cheek at times due to it's black humour. Two more reasons to watch it.
15/07/2019,9,"Well, this is definitely a classic. Pulp Fiction I think is one of those movies that has a plot so basic but has dialogue so interesting that you can enjoy it more than most Hollywood blockbusters. (Pulp fiction only had an 8 million dollar budget which makes it even more remarkable). So Pulp Fiction stars Samuel l Jackson and John Travolta, and I would say they are the main characters, as we see them the most, but the plot in this movie is essentially 3 stories about 1 story, so you really make your own mind up. Samuel l Jackson and John Travolta act very well in this movie, they are two hit men with very good dialogue. His role in Pulp Fiction also saved John Travolta's' film career. I think the best part of this movie is definitely the dialogue, as this movie isn't shot perfectly, or acted perfectly by ever actor. But it's the dialogue the characters say that makes this movie great."
08/07/2019,9,"Seen this movie long ago. Thought it was ground breaking when I saw it, left the theater in a great mood after a ""funnnnn"" movie!Several years later, happened to catch it again on one of the Premium services. Prompted me to go out and buy a copy of it.What a great movie, get off the bash wagon!"
06/07/2019,9,"There are many great movies that I've seen, truly. But no movie like this one has become part of my life, like a true friend that you love to spend time with, from time to time, as `Pulp Fiction' did. Why? Is it a miracle? After all, it has nothing kinetically special: no news and dazzling fx, no strange location, no huge names starring (except for Willis, only a thick bunch of excellent `almost stars', and Travolta was no longer high-rated before PF), no outrageous sex or violence scenes. But it has the Word. Quentin Tarantino would rather NOT make any other movie after this: it is inevitable that now the audience expectations are set on PF, and nothing (I mean nothing) will be ever even equal to it. It has the Word. Yes, it has It. The story structure is a round architecture, making everyone unable to re-tell it in the exact order, if asked to. 	 Yet, the Word. Each and everyone script line is so sharp and inspired to turn the whole movie into a conversational roller-coaster. All characters, even the most marginal ones, have memorable lines to tell: those lines are filled with all the selfishness, the greed, the fear and the human weaknesses that we all embody in our ordinary life; only, they are spoken exactly like we have always dreamed to speak, without ever have been able to, at least at the right time. Everything is realistic in this movie: everything except the speeches. It doesn't really matter whether they are spoken by people far less than ordinary or not. They are the real kinetic magic of the film, and I'm not surprised knowing how many merchandising pieces have been sold bearing (some of) the most significant lines spoken by characters. The Word, along with the sublime a-morality of the telling, along with the masterful close-ups, along with the subtle depiction of violence (much less shown than suggested), along with the carving of the most realistic villains ever captured on grotesque cinema; the Word and all of this together make this two hour and a half running movie one of the milestones of the decade."
30/06/2019,9,"I mean, that's what pulp fiction is, isn't it?Anyway, Pulp Fiction is one of those few films that hit big and then are remembered long after.  Usually, it take time for a film to get noticed and then become a classic (Citizen Cane) but some hit big and stay big (Star Wars), generally increasing in popularity as time flies by.  If Pulp Fiction is the Star Wars of the '90s, then I pity the kid who buy's the Vega trigger-happy.In fact, from how the media plays this film out, (EW) Pulp Fiction must be the defining film of the '90s.  The people who bought tickets to this film were the children of the drug swinging hippies of the '60s, and those trippy parents bought tickets because well, they ain't getting any younger.  The moment this film landed in Cannes, it was an instant sensation, and well, it propelled director Tarantino to heights and hype as a director not seen since another directors second flop.Pulp Fiction is a classic and if it is to be remembered as the defining film of the decade or the truth that QT is the real deal, then that certainly is the real pulp fiction."
21/06/2019,9,"This film is phenomenal, easily top 5 or even the best film of all time. It is rare for me to feel happy while watching a film, but when I watch this movie I feel happy, I listen to every word, and feel completely immersed in every thing that is happening. It is shocking that this film only won one Oscar, very frustrating to even think about it, but most people seem to agree this is much better than Forrest Gump, I feel myself hating that movie for these reasons. Samuel l. Jackson should have won an Oscar, his performance is incredible, I hang on every word he says, he also has a lot of memorable lines. The characters in this film act so well together, that it doesn't even seem like their acting, but are instead meaning it. The soundtrack couldn't have been any better, it is perfect. Tarantino's talent is displayed in full view here, at the top of his abilities. This film is not serious, it is more relaxed and entertaining, but done so well you take it seriously, if that makes sense. I rarely have strong feelings for most films, but this film is different than most films, different in way that is more well done than most films that go by the rules/guidelines. This film is tied with The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for the best film of all time. No film will ever be like Pulp Fiction ever again, unless they copy it, that says a lot. I'd recommend this film to anyone, everybody needs to see this film, it is the best of Tarantino's masterpieces. I can't believe people cry about this films success, 1 star ratings by people that can't handle this film."
13/06/2019,9,"What a great movie by Quentin Tarantino set in the late 1980s/early 1990s. A typical classic. In my opinion, this is not Quentin's finest and best work as I prefer some of his other movies such as Django Unchained, but this is definitely his most iconic picture. For some reason, Quentin Tarantino always manages to pull off such great dialogue in his movies which have a very nice flair to them. Dialogue, which is clearly one of his strengths, build up rising tension and as a viewer you never know what is going to happen next in the scene. There are some unexpected twists in the movie that really shocked me. I found myself gasping a few times throughout the movie. 'Pulp Fiction' is just another great example of what a fantastic writer and director Quentin Tarantino really is. My favourite performance in this movie was by far Samuel L Jackson's one. He really shined throughout every single scene with his great acting presence. It is always such a joy for me to watch this brilliant man act. Another actor who I liked way more than expected was the great Bruce Willis whose performance really surprised me since I had never seen him act so well before. This movie is fantastic, sure does it feel different to other movies you have seen, but that's what makes a movie great and stand out from others. I whole-heartedly recommend this amazing piece of fiction to everyone who is a film fan and doesn't mind a little bit of gore. This my friends, is a true classic! 8.5/10"
12/06/2019,9,"What more is there to say about ""Pulp Fiction."" Released in 1994, the film was an adrenaline shot to the heart of the film industry. Though the movie payed homage to a variety of film genres and styles (film noir, gangster film, French New Wave), it managed to be unlike anything seen before. Whether you love ""Pulp Fiction"" or hate it (and I, for one, love it) you can't deny the impact it had on film-making moving forward into the 21st Century. While watching ""Pulp Fiction"" for the first time, I knew sitting there in the theatre that I was seeing something that would immediately influence movies forever, and it has. I won't bother to summarize the plot, since plot in this movie is only of incidental importance anyway. I won't bother to single out individual performances, since the performances are uniformly excellent. I will save my praise for Quentin Tarantino's audacious attempts to show us something original, daring and experimental and for giving us a welcome break from the stale products Hollywood studios have been churning out for years. If you're one of the handful of people in the world who haven't yet seen this film, run out and see it now. I can't guarantee you'll like it, but I can guarantee that you'll have a definite opinion about it, and even that is refreshing these days.Grade: A"
07/06/2019,9,"it may be a long movie, but the time flies when your watching because its so bloody fantastic. it is loaded with mind boggling entertainment that will make you want to watch it over and over and over again. the directing job is exquisite, the dialogue is nothing short of breathtaking, the choice of actors audacious and the song list is something that will make you want to buy the soundtrack. anyone who didn't enjoy this movie just didn't understand it and should watch it until they do, and if you still don't like it, you need a lobotomy. every movie ever made should be compared to this one. every time your watching a movie that isn't Pulp Fiction, your wasting time where you could be watching it. watching this movie will make you want to get a bible and read the dialogue so you can use it in future too. this is the movie that got john travolta back on the screen after a long period where he wasn't gracing us with his presence."
05/06/2019,9,"This is perfect storytelling, acting... An instant classic : an homage to B movies of the golden age and very modern in his conception at the same time. Samuel Jackson plays Tarantino's screenplay like a music instrument, John Travolta seems to be back from the dead, Harvey Keitel is hilarious, Uma Thurman's part is so moving, Bruce Willis is so bad ass, Maria Medeiros so cute... Every songs of the soundtrack are unforgettable. Each frame absolutely gorgeous... Tarantino is a genius and his love for cinema explodes everywhere in this movie. With ""Wild at Heart"" by David Lynch, it's one of the greatest rock'n'roll Palme d'Or in movie history. If you haven't see it yet,how lucky you are !"
29/05/2019,2,"Brilliant! Quinton Tarantino has out done himself with this film and its a must buy. His ability to place the audience in the middle of a crazy story and wrap it up at the end deserves recognition. This Film is full of amazing actors who make everything work beautifully. It is so hard to choose which character did the best job because their was so many. Uma Thurman, John Travolta, and Samuel L. Jackson in my opinion did the best. Watching this film for the first time requires a lot of attention as well as applause. The Cinematography was excellent and the ability for scenes to flow in such a way really is a work of art. Definitely a 9 out of 10 if not a perfect 10. Nothing can be changed to make this film better."
23/05/2019,2,"Tarantino is one of the best directors of the world to himself. His Cinematographic was spectacular. Pulp Fiction was model for young filmmakers around the world with so many great scene.It's Brilliant.Tarantino borrowed amazing classic movie. combine them in best way then make his own masterpiece. soundtrack was great too. The Characterizations was awesome. It was nominated Oscar.Travolta dancing with Thurman was good.I really enjoyed to watch this movie. Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."
15/05/2019,2,"It's no surprise that 'Pulp fiction' is a movie that made cinematic history and defined the pulp fiction genre. It features a series of conversations and events coherently, but not chronologically, told. Tarantino tells three different but intertwined stories. Each of the stories are clichéd and have a noir feel but Tarantino gives them a different and unique treatment and adds sharp witty dialogues full of truth and irony (and references to many classic movies and popular TV shows). He uses a lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted. Also there's a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing. There's also a certain ambiguity about it. It's not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned Ringo...lots of questions and the answers are open for discussion. The cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic. Then there's the outstanding cast that includes, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Rosanne Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeires and Amanda Plummer, all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery. There are so many classic scenes that people discuss, even today. My personal favourites are the date sequence (and the scenes that follow) with Travolta and Thurman and the series of conversations between Travolta and Jackson. I doubt there's anything to say about 'Pulp Fiction' that hasn't been said. Whether one likes it or not, this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies. I have already seen it at least four times and it still amuses and fascinates me just like it did during first viewing."
08/05/2019,2,"There are movies that open you up, and make you feel relaxed. Some of the movies can give you strength and make you feel hopeful. They are full of messages. But there are some movies, which are just the opposite. They cause a violent feeling within you. After watching those movies you may say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?' 'That is so vicious!' or something similar.It is obvious that I am referring to Pulp Fiction to the second type. I am sure everyone must be shocked by the way the film progressed. The executions, drug consumption, the lifestyles of thugs, conversations etc. are shown in such a raw way that it will make you think for days about the movie and make you say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?'. The movie gave no explicit messages and just had shown lifestyles of certain kind of people. But this no-message story, is shown in such raw and real way that it will make you see and think about this movie again and again. Hats off to direction.That's why the name :""Pulp Fiction"""
07/05/2019,2,"An absolute classic in every sense and a must see for anyone even vaguely interested in films! A non-linear narrative following various characters including two hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson) a mob boss Marcellus Wallace and his wife Mia (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a boxer named Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). They all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. It's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. The dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. I remember when I was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of Tarantino's films. My fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until I was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when I became of age to finally watch this masterpiece. It certainly didn't disappoint and it was my favourite QT picture to date. It's rightly become a huge staple in pop culture while also maintaining serious rewatchability and classic status. 'Zed's Dead, baby. Zed's Dead.'"
05/05/2019,2,"Quentin Tarantino has proven to be the best director since Martin Scorsese came on the scene in the 1970's.  The movie stars some of today's biggest stars, e.g. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and Ving Rhames.  Plus the absolutely hilarious and cool scene with Christopher Walken telling Young Butch the importance of a gold watch."
04/05/2019,2,"Wow, a lot of people have been fooled into believing that this was a great film. I've never seen anything like it, and I hope I never will again. This is one slop of a film, and I'm disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews. It was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing. I didn't care for the characters and never will. What a hopeless bunch of freaks. I don't jump on the ""freak bandwagon"" unless they're natural ones, not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment. The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and that is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe that some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being themselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike everything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews. It uses the ""peer pressure"" method. You know, ""this movie is for intelligent and cool people"" CRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a ""shock flick"". It was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further. Unfortunately, it drags what little respect that Hollywood has with it. I'm afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust.There's my two pennies, don't spend them all in one place!"
29/04/2019,5,"Pulp fiction is... well it's pulp fiction. It gets everything right. I initially didn't think much of this film on a first viewing but it's slowly become one of my all time favourites (yes I know that's cliché)
This was Tarantino's break out flick, and as much as I love reservoir dogs I'm happy that it is. I'm let's face it, this is still his best movie. I can gush about the performances, specifically Jackson because my god is he great in this. I just wanted to mention Travolta, who disappeared after the Grease and then was crapped on after 'B:E' and 'Gotti'. He's not exactly my cup of tea but even I can admit he is great in this
You've already seen it, you've got the poster on your wall. This review will just be added to the masses but hey everyone 10/10 counts, right?"
10/04/2019,4,"Spoilers This movie says that life sometimes sends a message from God so we should listen. This plot moves in and out of several related stories and the time-line jumbles around so that the way it is presented, it enables us to see the hand of God. We see justice served and spirituality wins out and the evil gets killed, and/or embarrassed and/or other nasty things. We start the movie in a restaurant and watch a husband and wife robbery team begin a robbery. There are two hit men in that restaurant. We move in and out of a story of the two hit men who work for a mobster named Marcel. We watch the hit men pull off a hit and get the money that the victim (played by Frank Whaley) owed the mobster Marcel. I got a real kick out of Whaley repeating ""What?"". The hit-man points his gun and says: ""Go ahead, say ""What"" again! I dare ya! I double dare ya! Then Whaley's character says ""What?"". BLAM! He is shot in the leg.We watch as one of the hit men Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) takes Marcel's wife out on the town, per Marcel's orders. Vega fears his boss Marcel's jelousy. Additionally, Marcel's wife ODs. Then we watch a frantic rescue effort bring her back. We watch as a boxer (played Bruce Willis) is told and paid by Marcel to throw a fight. Instead this boxer pummels his opponent to death in the first round. Then he attempts to gettaway with the help of a lady cab driver, who was turned on by the killing.There are many more surprises in this movie and a reason why I called this ""Evil Blood and Guts Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption; and WHAT?"". Every minute of this movie should make you look at the screen with your eyes opening very wide and quote Frank Whaley's character ""What?"" This is easily one of the best movies ever and many have tried to repeat it, but never come close."
02/04/2019,5,"Interweaving three stories about small time gangsters, ""Pulp Fiction"" proved to be one of the most interesting, original, and entertaining films of the last fifteen years.  Using Tarantino's characteristic dialogue, in which the characters speak about everyday things rather than just the plot, the movie creates a light atmosphere, counterpointed by moments of extreme violence and intensity.  An infusion of many classic genres, such as noir, it manages to put a new spin on many old cliches.  A must see for any  appreciator of cinema."
14/03/2019,2,"I just finished watching Pulp FictionTarantino nails his screenplay again. This type of talent is not taught at a screenwriting class. You either have it or you do not. Sadly too many people are making movies today, who do not have it, and there are too few talents like Tarantino.Too many movies these days just seem to say things to advance the plot. The dialogue here is genius, brilliantly funny (you laugh at the dialogue, even though he does not seem to be going for a laugh) and no two characters sound the same, everyone has their own way of talking. I'm appreciating the dialogue so much more watching them again.I think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong.Whilst this movie revived John Travolta's career, it's Samuel L Jackson who steals the show. Every time I watch the movie I think he should have won the Oscar. Then I watch Ed Wood, and think Martin Landau deserved it. My opinion on this one, really comes down to which of the two movies I last watched.Harvey Kieren (in his second Tarantino flick) is great as Winston Wolf (I really wish he did not parody this role in tv ads) Tim Roth (also in his second Tarantino flick) and Amanda Plummer fun and I can not believe I never noticed it was Steve Buscemi (also in his second Tarantino flick) as the waiter Buddy Holly at Jack Rabbit Slim's.Pulp Fiction was a massive hit. It grossed $107 million (against an $8 million budget)
At the domestic box office to end the year, as the 10th highest grossing movie of the year."
14/03/2019,2,"Throughout the years I often heard how Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all time. It wasn't until today I finally had taken the time to sit down and watch this for the first time from start to finish to see what all the fuss is about. Needless to say, this is a very mixed bag for meWhat I like about Pulp Fiction is the plot being all jumbled up and not straight forward like many other movies where you see how everything begins and ends. Pulp Fiction doesnt do that. It's back to front so to speak starting at the end but going backwards. It feels disconnected and out of place as it tells different stories but they are actually are all connected in a wayI also liked the deep themes and talks of existentialism, nihilism and philosophical talks of God with some of the characters. It also helped the movie had a great star studded cast to give Pulp Fiction and extra umph to itWhat I dont like is the subplot for Burce Willis's character that involved him and a mob boss being tied up and were about to be raped by two guys with the mob boss getting raped. I hate rape and I hate how it's used in media. It's just awful and always feel sick about it. If I had known rape was a factor in Pulp Fiction I would not have bothered at all. Thankfully though the rapists get what's coming to them in the endI also didnt like how some scenes and dialogue with the characters fell flat where nothing really happens and it just drags on and on. I actually didnt start to like or get interested until Bruce Willis is in a shootout with the mob boss character but then the rape part comes ugh.Overall this movie was decent and I have no regrets in taking the time to watch this for my Sunday morning. It's definitely not a movie I'd be considered in watching again, once is enough for me and not to add to my ever growing DVD collection."
21/01/2019,8,"This movie is definitely the most overrated piece of sh*t ever.No story, no plot, no message, just Tarantino so totally in love with his own ""witty"" dialogue.The movie is empty in every sense of the word. In addition, it's also horribly boring and therefore ridiculously hard to watch. I always try to sit through every movie I start, but damn, with this one it was a hard task not to simply get up and walk away.Pulp Fiction does not deserve to be on top of IMDb's list of best rated movies with actual masterpieces like ""The Shawshank Revenge"". The latter is a work of art, Pulp Fiction is merely a piece of sh*t dressed up as one and it's amazing how many people fall for it."
06/01/2019,9,"Wow!!! I've never seen a movie like this.It's something that the human mind can't create, that's why I consider Tarantino and Avary two Extra-Terrestrials.This movie has everything you want, everything you are looking for, in a word is perfect!!! The actors play their characters wonderfully and the editing is genial.I think it will be very hard to make a movie like this in the future because Pulp Fiction is unique, is a masterpiece.All the scenes of the movie are perfect. The one I prefer is when Mr. Wolf arrives at Jimmies'house and he introduces himself to Vincent and Jules like a real professional worker: a wonderful playing.Dialogs are the thing that makes this movie great: during its 154 minutes you never get bored and you think that the runtime of the movie is not so long.10 stars out of 10."
02/01/2019,8,"While I am in no way against gore in a movie, I found the fact that this movie exploited it so badly, that the plot was so stupid, and the acting so completely idiotic (and I like these actors/actresses) that this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Far worse than any of the famously bad cult/monster movies of the 50's-60's. never could understand how anyone could ever have thought this movie had any redeeming qualities, much less actually liked by anyone. The movie is so bad, it prompted me to register with IMDb to add my vote. Wish I could vote a zero...as in the movie never should have been made. Could not imagine a greater waste of time or talent."
25/12/2018,8,"Most people I know who have seen this movie either think it's the best movie ever or the worst piece of trash ever produced.  I happen to fall in the middle.  I enjoyed this film, though not immensely.  I found it funny, which actually kind of disturbs me in a way.  Should it be funny when someone accidentally gets blown away? Yet I found it to be.  Still, I think the extreme amount of violence got to me, since it mostly did not have much of a point; it is really only the one scene of violence that I thought was amusing.  I thought the Bruce Willis storyline could have been done without, instead focusing on Travolta and Jackson.  Instead, the ""story"" meanders and seems largely without purpose.  Despite that, though, it was still an enjoyable film.  I recommend it as long as people realise what they're in for, and don't just watch it because of the hype surrounding it; when someone expects perfection and they don't get it, they tend to over-compensate and react more negatively than they otherwise would have, and end up giving this film a 1 instead of the 5 they might have given it had they not been shocked by the content.I give this film a 6.5, mainly for the dark humor.  This movie is not for everyone.  Don't watch this movie with blinders on, and hopefully it will be worth the 2 hours and (possibly) the $3-4 you spent to rent it (although in Canada, I know you can watch an unedited version of it on Showcase- that channel is great for films they can't show on the networks without such severe editing that part of the story is lost).  The other thing I liked about this movie was the characters themselves; Tarantino is very good at taking what would from the outside seem like despicable, inhumane creatures and making them human.  While I don't know how many hitmen are actually nice guys, it is nice to see films sometimes that have normal people doing bad things, instead of just evil, rotten, flat characters.  This film is thus a good character study, for those interested in the workings of the human mind."
07/11/2018,10,"The movie is a masterpiece that defies conventional storytelling. Released in 1994, this iconic film weaves together multiple narratives of crime, redemption, and dark humor in a non-linear fashion. Tarantino's signature style is evident in every frame, from the sharp dialogue to the eclectic soundtrack.The film boasts an ensemble cast delivering unforgettable performances: John Travolta as the charismatic hitman Vincent Vega, Samuel L. Jackson as his philosophical partner Jules Winnfield, and Uma Thurman as the enigmatic Mia Wallace. Their chemistry on screen is electrifying, enhanced by Tarantino's knack for creating compelling characters with depth and quirks.""Pulp Fiction"" is not just about its characters; it's about the journey. Each storyline intertwines seamlessly, creating a tapestry of violence, wit, and unexpected turns. From the iconic dance scene at Jack Rabbit Slim's to the adrenaline-pumping diner hold-up, the film keeps viewers on the edge of their seats while challenging them to think deeper about morality and fate.What sets ""Pulp Fiction"" apart is its bold narrative structure and unapologetic exploration of taboo subjects. Tarantino skillfully blends genres, incorporating elements of crime thriller, black comedy, and even existential drama. The result is a cinematic experience that remains as fresh and influential today as it was upon its release.In conclusion, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a tour de force of filmmaking that continues to resonate with audiences for its bold storytelling, unforgettable characters, and innovative approach. It's a must-watch for anyone interested in cinema that pushes boundaries and leaves a lasting impact."
09/10/2018,10,The movie was very good. I saw this movie many times. I suggest you see and enjoy. My wife suggested this movie to me and we saw it together and I suggested to some people to watch it.
13/09/2018,10,"PULP FICTION(1994) **** John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Peter Greene,Frank Whaley, Julia Sweeney, Quentin Tarantino.  Propolsive in-your-face salute to film noir with a Nineties slant with savvy filmmaking from auteur Tarantino interweaving three tales of crime, sex, greed and O. Henry sensibility mixed with Murphy's Law.  Outstanding in every sense with memorable performances by all particularly dim-witted hit man Travolta (Best Actor nominee in his second comeback) and Bible-verse speaking partner Jackson (Best Supporting Actor nominee) and a beefed up and nervy turn by Willis.  Wickedly clever and outrageously funny with some truly surprising moments of unease, carefully handled violence and arguably cinema's  worst blind date ever with kudos to an adrenaline enhanced kitschy Thurman (Best Supporting Actress nominee).  Winner of The Palmme d'Orr at Cannes and Oscar winner for Tarantino (also nominated for directing and Best Picture) for Best Original Screenplay with Roger Avary.  One of the decade's best."
01/09/2018,10,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a masterpiece, a pure masterpiece. There are not many movies that can be watched over and over, and which still have a fresh feeling every time. ""Pulp Fiction"" happens to be one of those movies and by far the greatest of them, the best movie that has been yet made.Giving a one movie the title of ""the best"" is a gutsy thing to do, but I'm convinced that """"Pulp Fiction"" deserves that title. A movie like ""The Godfather"" is an excellent piece of a criminal drama. It's intense, distressing and respectable movie in it's category, the best of it's genre. But the reason why it can't be the best of them all, is the reason it has a clear genre. The same goes for ""Memento"", ""Psycho"", ""Star Wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Pianist"", ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and many other movies that represent the best of their genre. All of those movies has a power to provoke strong emotions from its viewer. That is if the viewer happens to enjoy movies from the particular genre.What makes ""Pulp Fiction"" different from any other movie is the fact that is has no genre. It's comedy, drama, thriller, action, crime, et cetera. Pulp Fiction is everything and it feels like everything. Because of that anyone can see the movie and love it. While watching ""Pulp Fiction"", all kinds of emotions start running through. A viewer feels joy, sorrow, excitement, confusion, comprehension and a large set of other emotions. It's also interesting that even though this movie makes its viewer to go through so intense set of different emotions, it manages to create a perfect equilibrium with everything. After the movie is over, the experience is like after no other movie. The viewer has no central emotion, all the human emotions are active. Love, hate, happiness, sorrow, excitement, confusion are only the tip of the iceberg about the emotions that are felt at the same time. Really strange mix of emotions, impossible to explain, but something that must be experienced.Of course that doesn't apply for everyone. There's always a minority of people who can't feel the same as the majority does. When it comes to ""Pulp Fiction"" the reason for not feeling the same way could be it's violent theme, it's sexual content, it's nonlinear storytelling, anything that just doesn't isn't acceptable in the eyes of the viewer. But because this movie is a mix of so many different movie genres, it's the movie that will most likely give anyone the best movie experience that he or she has ever experienced."
04/08/2018,7,"Different episodes are alike in some aspects and completely different in other aspects. Just like variations on a theme in music, the interesting point is their participation in the final geometry of the movie. This one is just great..."
29/07/2018,9,"I've watched all films that Tarantino directed but for me this Pulp Fiction is the best of all of them.It's a little bit difficult to explain this movie. This looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue , three stories and epilogue.They seem to be disconnected but after watching, everything is connected.Prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from Mafia Vincent and Jules . They takes a order from their boss Marsellus to collect  his possessions.   First story is about Vincent and Marsellus's wife Vega. He is asked to take care of her by Marsellus.  Second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose.  Third is about Vincent and Jules again. They happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve.  Epilogue is also them at a restaurant.If there's a word describes this movie, it must be ""crazy"" in a good sense. All of the stories are completely crazy, full of sex talks and violence, and there's no message from this. However, I do love this craziness.  I have to admit that Tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters. Particularly, I like Jules acted by Samuel Jackson. I'm fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites Ezekiel 25:17. It's imprinted on my mind. Also I think conversations of this movie are really amusing. They're meaningless and not important but  For instance, one about hamburger is awesome. Every time after watching, I come to want to eat a hamburger!The story I like most is second. The scene Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing!This is a cheap B movie. But it's waste to miss this sophisticated story , direction like music and enjoyable acting.After watching, you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again."
29/07/2018,9,"Firstly I should say that I saw the sanitised for tv version - I don't watch 'R' rated movies and this was 'R' rated even here in Australia. This obviously means that the film was not entirely as the director intended it to be. I must say 'though that, while this film has many interesting features, some classy acting and the occasional witty repartee', it is in my opinion on the whole nothing more than a crude and juvenile attempt to shock and offend the majority of the movie watching population. Being visually and verbally assaulted by film may well make for a memorable cinematic experience but doesn't necessarily make for a good film. But it isn't so much the action itself as much as the language which achieves this - and most of the profanities (and I include the all too frequent use of n****r in this list) were unnecessary - I tend to side with Spike Lee on this issue, QT is never gonna be a black man no matter how hard he might try. And while this movie is offensive and far from original, it has some very clever aspects and shows some of the directorial class QT clearly has (although no real acting ability - his cameo was a big mistake). In all I ended up with rather mixed feelings about this movie. My vote 7/10"

14/06/2018,9,"I think that Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is not just a great movie, but quite possibly the greatest movie ever made. It has everything that a movie-goer would love to see in a movie. A great script full of plenty of gross-out moments, shocking moments, humor, great lines, and parts that make a watcher think. The film does not treat the audience like a moron like so many recent films have the tendency to do. It leaves you on the edge of your seat and you have to have an IQ that is larger than your shoe size to fully understand it.Tarantino also use time as a plot driving device in the most effective way I have ever seen put to film. I guess you could say that the film is in ""flashback"" form, but the characters and the plot that you see in those ""flashbacks"" make you forget that it has already happened! Along with the monster performances that Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman put on the table (not to mention the small, well acted part Quentin Tarantino did himself) makes this movie a 5 out of 4 star movie and an instant classic. Enjoy, it comes highly recommended by yours truly,Movieman02"
26/05/2018,2,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. Like all great directors, Q.T. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. A lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but ""Pulp Fiction"" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. And not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. It's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time.A lesser director than Tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. Instead, Tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: He actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. Most critics interpret this as Quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. They're wrong. The dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. The difference is that dialogue in a movie such as ""The Presidio"" isn't real at all. The characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (""rinse, spit, repeat""). Quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. No doubt Jules and Vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. One must keep in mind that we actually hear little about Jules and Vincent, and even less talk between them. But when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. And this is what so many people miss when viewing ""Pulp Fiction"" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. Quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the French translate the term ""Quarter Pounder with Cheese"" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: Quentin later uses this same reference for Jules before he and Vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), one of the town's major kingpins.
There are essentially three stories in ""Pulp Fiction,"" intertwined between one another. It opens with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her boyfriend (Tim Roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. By their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them ""with their pants down""? The stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following Jules and Vincent, who work for Marsellus, who has paid championship boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to fall in his upcoming match. But Butch has a better plan: Bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. He almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with Marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in ""Deliverance.""Back to the dialogue. It is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. It's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. For example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear Jules and Vincent discussing the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese? No. But our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if Tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. There are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends or family has a deeper meaning and will no doubt relate to the matter at hand. All dialogue relates to a larger scheme, and so does the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction."" It's just more casual and subtle than most movies. It's not pointless, but it's not deliberate, which is a fine line to try and balance on. Quentin does so successfully, crossing the finish line with enthusiasm, which is no doubt part of what elevates ""Pulp Fiction"" above so many other motion pictures of its genre.5/5."
16/05/2018,2,"First thing's first, this is tarantino's most original and famous script ever written. the diffrenet storylines of the characters in the movie are so great you would watch them again and enjoy them just like the first time. all diffrenet story arcs clash togeter in unexpected ways. one of the main advantages of the film is the narrative that goes all upsite down, the narrative doesn't go from start to finish and it's better that way, it's a way of tarantino to tell his story in all sort of ways and directions. the characters were well written and my favorite character has to be jules, he had most of the unforgetable lines and was a key member in the movie. the soundtrack was terrific and definitely great for the tone and genre of the movie. the actors were fantastic with samuel l. jackson and john travolta at there best in thus masterpiece. so if the movie is so perfect why give it a 8? maybe it's not perfect in all categories and maybe some people consider it only to be one of tarantino's greatest but not THE greatest. I for once disagree cuase it is perfect and surtely the best of all."
14/05/2018,2,"It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesn't work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isn't.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He ""played"" a dance, which isn't the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesn't dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isn't a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys aren't just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isn't like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didn't have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesn't last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isn't a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece don't know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they don't really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip."
13/05/2018,2,"""Pulp Fiction"" is considered Quentin Tarantino' masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although it's not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, ""Pulp Fiction"" has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and we're seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- he'll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasn't been working on the level of ""Pulp Fiction."" Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date that's not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When he's on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I don't know why it never gets old, but it doesn't. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with ""The Bonnie Situation."" The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincent's heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle that's cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence. Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of ""Pulp Fiction"" has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" you won't see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn't quite flow like a Tarantino film that we've become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. He's not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor. The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is ""The Gold Watch"" section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his ""Die Hard"" facial expressions, especially when they're not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we won't care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard it's pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. ""The Gold Watch"" has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family. ""The Bonnie Situation"" may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet ""The Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally ""shot Marvin the face."" ""The Bonnie Situation"" offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he ""walks the earth."" Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn't make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny's"" last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways."
11/05/2018,2,"I cannot count the no. Of times I've watched this epic. For every cast/crew involved in this, it's probably their best piece of work. Released in 1994, a year which gave us Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption, Lion King & Speed (including Hum Aapke Hain Kaun & Andaaz Apna Apna). Any other year it would have grabbed every Academy award possible, but Tarantino had to settle for only one i.e., Best Original Screenplay.Probably one of the best display of non-linear screenplay, this film revolves around eight characters Pumpkin (Roth), Honey Bunny, Jules (L. Jackson), Vincent (Travolta), Mia (Thurman), Butch (Willis) and Marsellus Wallace (Rhames). Not to mention some of the great cameos from Keitel (The Wolf), Walken (Captain Koons) and Tantino himself as Jimmie. Even if you aren't familiar with any of these names, this chaotic comedy is still worth everyone's time.Tarantino's great taste of music is clearly evident with some of the finest soundtracks suiting the scene will blow your mind.GOAT!!!"
11/05/2018,2,"Exceptional. Pulp Fiction can not be classified in any category, it goes beyond anything that has been done before and creates something that no one else can reproduce except Tarantino himself. The scenario is very particular, disconnected and mended with relevance in order to present the film to us in a new light. We are transported in the past, the future and we return to the present."
09/05/2018,1,"Seriously. I mean, this film is mildly amusing, and I saw it at the theater when it first came out. But I really can't watch the whole thing repeatedly, like with some true classics. It certainly doesn't deserve to be ranked in the top 5, or even really the top 100.Both Reservoir Dogs and True Romance are better films, even just examining the Tarantino Ouvre. The Christopher Walken / Dennis Hopper scene (and the Pimp-fight scene) from True Romance alone blows this film away.In all, I think this is ultimately a case of the emperor not wearing any clothes. If you watch these three films in one weekend, you should clearly see that PF is the weak link of the bunch. Its success appears largely a product of buildup from the earlier films, along with the desire of people to appear hip and cool, both then and now."
09/05/2018,2,"Following the success of 1992's Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino released his finest film to-date, the self-proclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction; a film which is arguably the most influential of the last few decades, and one which stands alone as a ""to-be"" classic. Pulp Fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from. Pulp Fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. Revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, Pulp Fiction brings you inside a world Quentin Tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. The film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being Tim Roth and the other being Amanda Plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. This scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of Amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable ""cool"" of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). From here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality. Sure, Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the ""coolest"" and ""hippest"" films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. The film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. It is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact Pulp Fiction juggles allegory, such as the ""freedom"" of Amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. The film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms. Even behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. The inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. The characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. When I say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, I mean it. From Christopher Walken's cameo as Captain Koons, to Bruce Willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted ""boxer-thug"" performance. Everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. Yet, as Harvey Keitel states in the film, ""of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character"".Dense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets Pulp Fiction become its own piece. And rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. Yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. Few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why Quentin Tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. The script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. However, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy. One of the reasons Pulp Fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from French new-wave cinema, to Asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original. Quentin Tarantino ultimately creates his own sense of ""bravo-film-making"". The use of tracking-shots, dolly-zooms, variation in lens focus, quick-cut editing, slow-motion sequences, lyrical camera positioning, steadicam tactics and close-up camera shots, the variety Pulp Fiction has is not just held within inside its narrative, but within its technical side too. Then you have the dynamic use of music, which has clearly been hand-picked by Quentin Tarantino himself and suits the film with a simplistic level of ease. The set-pieces are also crafted with scrutinising detail, such as the notorious lair, involving two hillbillies, a gimp and two of the film's protagonists.Pulp Fiction is, quite simply, a hard-boiled, noir-toned masterpiece of modern cinema, comprised of film-making which deserves to be dissected frame-by-frame. The sheer unadulterated consistency of greatness Pulp Fiction follows means it is a film which should be watched again and again. Yes, all the characters might be ""sinners"", yet there is no denying that you will be rooting for a certain character(s) by the end of the film, as surely, with characters as diverse as these there must be someone you share the same belief with, right? Devine-intervention is what Pulp Fiction is, a miracle and one which justifies vast acknowledgement. Take for example Jimmy's (Quentin Tarantino) brief conversation on the ""gourmet"" of coffee, it sums up the magnificence of Pulp Fiction perfectly, not forgetting the addition of ""lots of cream, lots of sugar""."
09/05/2018,2,"You want to do something really neat? Take the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny. However, let's reserve the greatest films of all-time category for real masterpieces and real stories, and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks."
07/05/2018,1,"No matter which way you try to look at it, this picture is a masterpiece. The angles are nice, the cinematography is strong, the acting is good, the soundtrack is unmatched but the most important thing this film offers is its storytelling. The story pushes itself in a way that differs it from the other Hollywood movies made at the time. It doesn't really follow a normal ""Guy wants something, gets it"" kind of storyline. Instead it barricades a more Leonesque technique. The kind of storytelling which one would see in old and mostly forgotten pictures like ""The Trio"" or ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" where the story is much more complex than a guy wanting and getting something. This revitalised, superb storytelling, when combined with Tarantino's more down to earth dialogue and imagination, gives us the classic film that is Pulp Fiction."
07/05/2018,1,"Tarantino is my favourite director and this is his best work...by far. Everything is perfect. The acting, the directing, the dialog, the violence, the non linear story telling, the humor... If you haven't seen this marterpiece, do yourself a favour and watch it right now."
02/05/2018,1,I really liked this film because of tarentino style especially violence. And actors are the best especially samuel l jackson. You want to watch this movie if you didn't saw any tarentino. This movie is still fresh even after 26 years
02/05/2018,1,I came in with huge expectations just to find a movie with more holes than a piece of swiss cheese. I love Bruce Willis but he sucked. My favorite part was the combo of Travolta and SLJ. That didnt mean I enjoyed it. It wasn't terrible but a film that high has never met my expectations so low.
29/04/2018,5,"Pulp fiction is a type of movie which makes a strong argument for the case that cinema is both art and entertainment. Pulp fiction is a highly entertaining movie filled with extra ordinary performances, talented actors and a very intelligent script. That's not to say that it is not an artistic cinema, today, the movie stands as one of the greatest movie ever made. With non linear narrative, powerful performances, excellent score and memorable dialogues which will stay with u forever, pulp fiction qualifies the rigorous beauty that is cinema.."
13/04/2018,4,This film is amazing. Hands down. There is a reason why Pulp Fiction posters remains a constant staple in college dorm rooms.5/5. Quentin Tarantino's finest work. Damn quotable too.
11/02/2018,8,My favorite movie of all time. Everyone must see. I love absolutely everything about this movie from the script to the actors to the quick switches of scenes. It keeps your focus through the whole thing and is hilariously funny and forever quotable.
09/12/2017,8,"Absolutly the best film I've seen in my 17 years.  I'm studying to be a filmmaker and if Tarantino's work, even though some isn't as original as others, doesn't inspire you in one way or another, you obviously don't see the artistic achievement this young brilliant director has bestowed upon us. In my book, the man can do no wrong."
18/11/2017,10,"First things first, I hate Tarantino's dialogue. People don't talk like that. They don't reference obscure movies or recite Bible passages. Although I guess Tarantino's people aren't like others...another problem is the surf music soundtrack. It gets irritating after a while. But everything else is fine, particularly Harvey Keitel's slick performance, the interweaving of the three stories, and the alternately stylish and brutal visuals. This is arguably Tarantino's most over-indulgent movie though, so check out Jackie Brown for something a little less silly."
11/07/2017,9,"I just love ""Pulp Fiction"". I loved it when I saw if for the first time back in 1994 with my then 13-year old son in the theater, and I loved it again when I saw it last weekend on TV. Every time I see it, it seems to get better and better. I am fascinated by the incredible pace, witty dialogs, and brilliant writing - every piece of the puzzle falls in the right place, and in the end I don't care a bit about the mysterious case. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a glorious example of the fact that there is no low subject for Art. It is amazing how a work of art can consist of so many trashy elements, which is alluded to in the title of the film. It is populated by characters that came from the pages of cheap ""pulp fiction"" novels - gangsters, philosophical hit men, drug addicts and drug dealers, dangerous and sensual mistresses, naive girlfriends, crooked prizefighters with hurt prides and prized golden watches with long and deep histories. Tarantino and his co-writer Roger Avary took the clichés of hundreds of films, comic books and twenty-five-cent paperbacks and by magic of their talents turned them into something fresh, sparkling, clever, funny and incredibly enjoyable. I should mention Tarantino's taste for music - the soundtrack for ""Pulp Fiction"" (as for all of his films) is just killer. And last but not least - how well Tarantino works with his actors, in this film everybody shines. There are no bad performances in ""Pulp Fiction"". For me, it is a perfect film and a true source of joy, one that I've experienced dozens of times and am always ready for again.I've read many times on these boards that ""Tarantino is a rip-off artist"", that ""he takes bits and pieces (not influences) from other movies."" I often think of him as of a young boy who loves to play with his toys. For him, the toys are the old movies that he adores and he brings his love and admiration of these films to his own work. He is not greedy; he invites us to share his love, to play together, to have as much fun watching his films as he did while making them. Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. When I am in the presence of a great work of art I know the feeling, and Tarantino's film is a great work of art that happened to be very enjoyable. I cannot resist. Like any time of day is a good time for blueberry pie, any time of day and any day of the week is a good time to watch and enjoy ""Pulp Fiction""."
28/05/2017,1,This movie is one of the few that I nearly walked out on it was so bad.  It was too disjointed and I could not understand the point or plot.  People were killed in one scene and then popped up in another.  Lots of gratuitous violence and brutality that did not seem to have much to do with the plot.
27/05/2017,1,"This is a very boring movie. The way that the storyline is cut up into 4 different parts makes the movies feel all very disconnected. The film basically just showcases the lives of your average mobster type criminals. Many people say that the ""everyday life"" kind of feel of the movie is what makes it great; I say very plainly that this is what makes it dull. It certainly a well made movie, this is why I give it 6 and not less."
25/05/2017,1,"Why this movie is so popular escapes me.  I watched this movie at the recommendation of my friends, who all thought it was hilarious.  I found no humor anywhere, only lame philosophy wrapped up in glorified criminal activities.  I for one am glad that Forrest Gump won the Oscar over this load of bull.  I have never been able to watch anything with John Travolta or Bruce Willis since this came out, and it took me awhile to forgive Samuel Jackson for this movie as well.  Tarantino should never have been allowed to direct again.Skip this crap and rent something else, or you might lose respect for the actors involved.  I sure did."
12/05/2017,1,Pulp Fiction is the movie which I can see again and again. This is the master pieces of the actor John Travolta. You can see his classic acting skill in this movie. I will suggest everyone to watch this master piece.
07/05/2017,1,"Pulp Fiction is a movie crowded with turnarounds where the timeline doesn't follow the traditional scripts in Hollywood movies. Quentin Tarantino's creative writing is acid, sarcastic and irreverent. One of the best of his generation.
Pulp Fiction - A must-see movie."
07/05/2017,1,"Have you read my IMDb review of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs? The one where I say that, although the film is far from what I would class as original, the director unashamedly plundering the annals of obscure/cult/foreign cinema, the manner in which it is presented makes it a marvellous work of art in its own right?Same thing applies here. Only more-so.Pulp Fiction is an exquisite patchwork-quilt of a movie, stitched together from ideas, elements and scenes gathered together by Tarantino during his formative years as a movie-obsessed video store clerk. Assembled with an unerring eye for detail and the vision of a true artist, the film is a marvel to behold—over two and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance which proves just as captivating for me now as when I first clapped eyes on it almost two decades ago.Bold and bloody, with stunning performances from a wonderful ensemble cast, a flawless soundtrack, witty (and highly quotable) dialogue, and even a character called Brett, this impeccable slice of gritty neo-noir is fully deserving of top marks. 10/10."
02/05/2017,1,"Arguably Tarantino's best movie with an unusual yet talented cast. Travolta on his way back up the movie pecking order in an iconic duo with Samuel L. Jackson, sharing scenes with amazing actors such as Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken...Anyway, it's a perfect movie."
25/03/2017,1,"I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head."
03/03/2017,1,"I've watched this movie twice and I don't get the hype. I really don't. It's not a bad movie but it's not great either. It's not that i don't like Tarantino movies because I love the Kill Bill movies.This movie is pointless unless there is some subliminal point to it that I overlooked. It's like a joyride to nowhere. Sit back and enjoy the ride I guess. There is a lot of star power in this movie too.Frankly the only star worth watching is Samuel L Jackson. The other stars like Travolta, Willis, etc are just meh. The whole scene between Thurman and Travolta is laughable. Maybe it's not made to be taken seriously."
16/01/2017,8,"I always loved Tarantino. I loved how he direct a movie. And this? It's a masterpiece. I am pretty sure of that fact. It's wild, funny, dark, twisty, crazy, hilarious, and it kicks ass like nothing else. I wasn't able to breathe how good it was. Saw it 4 years ago and didn't appreciate it, it was long and I didn't know what was going on, but now, 4 years later, I'm saying that it's a delight of a movie and it contains one of the best scripts I've ever seen. It's exquisitely written and the characters are absolutely on-point. I love this movie very much and it is absolutely one of my favorites. Quentin, you one mother*ucker!"
15/12/2016,7,"The overwhelming praise for this film is beyond my comprehension. While it has a handful of darkly funny moments, and a fair splash of style, it's episodic, tasteless, sometimes downright disgusting, and far too quirky to make a good film.It has so many elements critics decry at every opportunity as the things which prove ""holywood"" is completely out of touch with it's audience that it brands most as hypocritical. Seems to prove it's not the sex, drugs, violence, and vulgarity that critics actually object to, but simply the package they come in.This is basically dreadful sludge masquerading as hip!"
13/12/2016,7,"Pulp Fiction is remarkable in the sense that it doesn't offer anything groundbreaking; yet when you piece the parts together, the unified film is refreshing and captivating. Quentin Tarantino as a fan implements cross-genre references ranging from Spaghetti Westerns to Asian action films. Not entirely bound by any genre, Pulp Fiction reinvents modern cinema in many ways, and QT has created a unique identity with his dialogue-driven stories and implied offscreen violence, among other creative styles.A good film does not necessarily need any jaw-dropping scene by itself, but it must work as a total system. While Pulp Fiction may or may not put you on the edge of your seat at any time, the entire film is well crafted to form a memorable and entertaining cinematic experience."
08/12/2016,8,"The first time I saw Pulp Fiction amazed me like not many others movies could did it. Not because his trend to violence, dark humor or some kind of sarcastic display of an especific subject or era, but for its genius tone.A rollecoaster sequences of brillance and madness that pursues you with all kinds of surprises, twists, and ways to put on full state of trance until it ends.All put together on a clever non chronological plot with overhelming good direction and editing. Samuel L Jackson was killer on his role, a full scene stealer, and all others technical aspects were on shape to the rest.This is an obligatory title to everyone who loves good films, either to art or fun oriented."
07/12/2016,8,"Pulp Fiction as with any landmark movie, more has been written about it than would surely. The type of wild and hysterical ranting that has surrounded this picture can be a little off-putting. But it's hard to over sell a movie that is so supremely confident in writing and direction. Despite an almost audience-annihilating run time of nearly two and a half-hours, it is consistently absorbing.Director and co-writer Quentin Tarantino is courteous enough to credit the viewer with some intelligence. This time the tale is far more sprawling and complex, but it also rewards and satisfies. As with many films considered classics, Pulp Fiction may seem out of date to many viewers watching the film for the first time, in recent memory."
07/12/2016,8,"The post-modern film relies heavily on both music and visual style to create something which has ultimately inspired a new generation of filmmakers. It's main strength comes from the character driven monologues and stellar performances of its A-list cast. Pulp Fiction takes on a new dimension upon repeat analysis and evolves with it audience and time period. Give it another watch and your likely to pick up a new interpretation hidden in the existing world of this top-notch film. Unlike Quentin Tarantino most current line of revenge films, Pulp Fiction has a slow and less action oriented pace which gives his witty dialogue more of a stage for the actors to push the boundaries of realism and formalism."
23/10/2016,10,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was in college--at the time it was one of the few movies I had seen more than once in the theatre. Since then, it has remained one of my favorite movies of all time. The script, editing, directing, and cinematography are all top notch, and the acting reaches heights of excellence. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis--all of these individuals are excellent actors at any time, but this movie truly highlights their talents. I especially enjoy Jackson in this movie--more so than in any other. The people who are hung up on the violence and profanity in this movie simply miss the point--this movie is meant for those with an open mind, a great sense of humor, and a true appreciation of cinematic excellence. Clearly, this movie's detractors should stay home and watch ""Seventh Heaven""."
20/09/2016,10,"This movie tries way too hard not to be cliché, which makes it feel forced at times. The storyline is exhaustingly boring, with only a few interesting scenes here and there. I kept watching because the ratings are so high, but even after reading all the glowing reviews, I still don't get the hype. (Maybe at the time it came out it was a good concept, idk.)The overall connection between the different storylines is okay, but not good enough to make it truly memorable. John Travolta delivers a solid performance, but Samuel L. Jackson's role feels over the top.For a film that's supposed to be groundbreaking, I found it disappointing. Trying to be innovative doesn't mean forcing yourself to stand out. For me, ""Pulp Fiction"" just barely reaches average."
16/09/2016,10,"As someone who first watched it in 2017, I don't see why this is in the top movies list, and that first part of the sentence might be the reason why.This movie's formula: ridiculous early 90's clothing, lots of foot fetish undertones, coked up dumb sluts who'd shove anything up their nose like toddlers, and men being killed in pointlessly excessive ways. Trying to glorify cliché black gang ""culture"" and mafioso themes. Weird, occasionally charming but unfitting jokes. Smoking in almost every scene. Insanely long intro sequence. Just as pointlessly long and non-engaging scenes that offer no substance, nothing to get you interested in what they're talking about, just casual chatter stretched over 2,5 hours. I couldn't finish watching it.My only guess is that some parts of the movie were considered ""badass"" at the time, it's 23 years old after all, which is why people are so looking at it trough nostalgia glasses. But it definitely doesn't hold up. And my movie expectations are already as low as ever, since nowadays most movies are utter crap. Some of Tarantino's more recent movies at least had some things going for them - gore, humor, cheesiness so cringy that it kind of makes you like it. But this one - doesn't hold up.None of the characters, except maybe John Travolta's are likable or interesting. There was nothing to keep me watching this. As soon as it switched to Bruice Willis' storyline I had to check out. That was just like watching a boring couple trough a hidden camera having a normal day. Wasn't this supposed to be a crime/drama movie? The ""interesting part"" never seems to begin. The acting was pretty corny and unbelievable as well.Overall feels like a low-budget ""avant garde"" movie shot as a school project, but I know it's far from that. That's just how it looks and feels like.I wanted to like it, but it just can't happen. I thoroughly enjoyed movies from as far as 60 years ago, so age can't excuse it, it was just too focused on that time frame and those cheesy, bland topic points. I don't blame Tarantino, it was one of his early movies, I'm just spellbound at how this movie is so highly rated.People seem to look too deeply for meaning where there is none. And the nostalgia glasses, take them off, it's been 23 years."
26/08/2016,7,"This movie just shows you how great Tarantino is at making films. He blends many cinematic tricks into one great movie and it worked! This movie is serious and funny at the same time which is hard to come by. I give it ten stars. The actors are great, they are freakishly believable you really feel that John Travolta is Vincent Vega. The supporting actors are just as good.Ving Rhames plays a great role but don't forget about Harvey Keitel as ""the wolf"" great acting. This movie packs a punch, it will be talked about for years to come. It also has a great soundtrack, it has Kool and the Gang! for God sakes! This just shows that Tarantino knows how to make good movies and that he knows good music. It's on my top five favorite movie list."
06/08/2016,7,"One of the best film I've been in a while . This film changed my whole outlook on how good movies are made .It's undeniably one of the most popular and influential films of all time. It's still being shamelessly imitated to this very day, yet Pulp Fiction the film is about nothing,it says nothing and it makes you feel nothing. It has an adolescent aesthetic and some of the dialogue could be from an early draft of Clerks, yet it is just so irresistibly ""cool"". Travolta and Samuel L Jackson in matching black suits; Harvey Keitel as Mr Wolf (now ruined thanks to Direct Line); the dance in the diner; Ving Rhames being mean– all so hip, all so enchanting, but none of it adds up to anything.And that is Tarantino's biggest flaw as a filmmaker. With the exception of the glorious Jackie Brown, all of his movies amount to nothing more than a few good scenes, while the overall narrative gets lost in his indulgence. Pulp Fiction is not a good film, though I may have believed it was in my younger, more impressionable days, when you had to like the film. On each re- watch, it lost a little more of the magic I thought was there the first time I saw it."
02/08/2016,6,"Describe Pulp Fiction in one word: impossible. Because it's impossible to describe it one word, so I'll use many: a complex, interwoven modern day fable with characters as colorful as an Alice in Wonderland rendition. This film, on the surface, appears to merely be an exploitation flick, mindless in its execution and gratuitous in its violence. On the contrary! The violence, while shocking, serves the purpose of jolting us out of our everyday life - it speaks to us, and ABOUT us, in ways that your average Hollywood popcorn movie can. We get to see the humour in murder. Injected with black as night humour, it tells the tale of a group of criminals ""behind-the-scenes."" We see their everyday conversations, fueled by intellect, wit, and poetry, debunking the stereotype that murderers are devoid of any real intelligence. Pulp Fiction is a film for the ages.In all honesty, I gave this film a low score because it's ridiculously overrated. Personally, I can't stand hearing QT's pretentious dialogue and the ""look-how-cool-I-am"" style really grates on my nerves. It's pretty popular to like this movie, so maybe I just have to hate everything popular, but that's obviously not the case, so...I don't know what it is. Mass brainwashing and hysteria over this egotist that likes to write himself into cool parts in his films so he can suck women's toes?"
18/07/2016,9,"10/10 Easily, this is a must see for anyone fifteen and up.Step aside Forrest Gump...I originally heard this was one of the coolest movies made in the 90's and that the music was perfectly intertwined with the story. Both were absolutely correct, but I will give you a review that will make you drive to Blockbusters right now and rent it or buy it.""What do two hitmen, a briefcase, a prizefighter, and a gold watch have in common?"" Pulp Fiction starts off with the music ""Jungle Boogie"" in the credits which we see later is actually a radio being tuned in by John Travolta (who was on a self-destructing movie career mode for almost 15 years until this) and Samuel L. Jackson (in his best performance to date) two hitmen who work in LA need to collect something from small-time crooks who screwed their vengeful boss (Ving Rhames) over. From start to finish Pulp Fiction's dialogue is the most known, most recognizable, and most quoted in cinematic history. Travolta and Jackson enter the apartment with guns ready, amusingly talking about how fast food in America is different than fast food in Europe and other such things.  Pulp Fiction immediately grabs your attention when Jackson and Travolta storm into the apartment room and demand answers, a briefcase, and a taste of a Big Kahuna burger. When Travolta opens up the briefcase we see a gold light emit from it, every single person who has seen this movie has a different opinion on what could be inside, but it's never revealed. In some very memorable dialogue Jackson intimidates the crooks by demanding answers on why they did what they did first by shooting one of them while another is trying to talk his way out of his death and saying to the leader of the group ""OH I'M SORRY DID I BREAK YOUR CONCENTRATION?"" Jackson shouts out his death-sentence prayer which might give you a chill the first time you see it and then opens fire on him while we see the gold light flash on Jackson and Travolta simeltaniously.Pulp Fiction consists of a few Oscar-Winning stories by Quentin Tarantino.Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace The Gold Watch The Bonnie SituationEach story is intertwined and reveals to us the true side of American crime and situations in the early 80's. The begining starts out, followed by the scene after the last scene, then a flashback, followed by the real end of the story where all loose ends are tied up, and then the first scene of the movie ties to the last scene. Sounds difficult? Absolutely not! Roger Avary and QT have made this complex story so simple almost anyone can understand it, and that is by no means a bad thing at all.Comedy, Dialogue, Drugs, Dancing, The Gold Watch, Boxing Incident, An Accidental Meet Between Two Small Time Bank Robbers In Love And Two Philosophical Hitmen, and The Gimp is how to explain Pulp Fiction. After seeing Pulp Fiction, it will almost definately go on your top 10 list of movies of all time.

04/07/2016,9,"The fact that this is one of the most acclaimed movies by both critics and audiences alike, worldwide, is no coincidence. The content of this film is shocking- one man's vision of the many different aspects of petty criminals lives in Los Angeles. Quentin Tarantino doesnt pull his punches and in both this and Reservoir Dogs, he portrays a very realistic view of gritty world, not worrying about excessive amounts of bad language, some graphic violent scenes, and even drug use. The magic of Tarantino is that he manages to couple this with a great, fast moving script, and a well thought out plot, that he executes perfectly. So not only do you feel that what you are watching is probably pretty close to reality, but it is irrestibly entertaining aswell. Pulp Fiction is really one story, following Vincent Vega(John Travolta)and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson), as they have a hectic couple of days at the office, working for crimelord Marsellus Wallace. But it is told in three shorter sections that,combined together, tell the tale. The good thing is that you have to follow quite closely to get the best out of the movie, and afterwards take a couple of seconds to sort the scenes you have seen into the correct order that they happened. It's not really hard or complicated, but makes the film more interesting than if it were a beginning-middle-end story. The way that Tarantino executes this, both in the script and the actual film itself, is deserving of all the accolades he recieved. Of course, the thing that carries the film, along with the script, is the fantastic acting by one of the best casts I have ever seen. Backing up Travolta and Jackson are: Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Harvey Kietel, Bruce Willis,Uma Thurman,Eric Stoltz,Tarantino Himself,Amanda Plummer, and fans of Reservoir Dogs, (like me), will be pleased to see Steve Buscemi make a small appearance as a waiter dressed up as Buddy Holly. Everything about this film is enjoyable, unless you are easily offended, and it deserves a lot of credit."
25/06/2016,9,"If you are sick and tired of the pathetic Holliwood crime movie- full of special effects but overall repetitive and with poor characterization and sense of humor-this is the movie you have got to watch. Quentin doesn't shoot this movie simply because he wants to provide us good entertainment, but also because he wants to pay a tribute to the great tradition of films noir. And he does this in an impeccable way. In Pulp Fiction the bad guys are nastier than ever before, and even the police are given to pure brutality ( cannot say more, watch it). The camera work is probably the best I have ever seen for a variety of reasons. First of all Tarantino uses a hyper-sensitive camera film which has the effect of making the colors brighter , so that the characters and the setting seem really to belong to a pulp book. Besides some scenes, such as the one of the injection, are very ingenuous and original, and I really appreciated such creativity especially vis-a-vis the repetitiveness of many modern crime movies. Finally, the non-linear plot of pulp fiction is simply amazing. WIth its numerous flash-backs and flash-forwards it contributes to keep your adrenaline high (especially in light of the fact that until two-third of the movie it is very hard to follow the plot), but at the end everything pieces together and you feel as content as when you solve a Rubrik's cube. As far as the acting is concerned, this is also of very high quality since all the actors seem very convincing (particularly John Travolta, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis), and they manage to alternate ultra violent parts with very humorous lines ( Do I look like a bitch? Then why are you trying to f**k me like a bitch) Overall, I rate Pulp FIction as 9.5, 10 . Not only it is the best movie by Tarantino but probably one of the best film noir ever."
08/06/2016,9,"For those unfamiliar with writer/director Quentin Tarantino's cult masterpiece Pulp Fiction, it is a twisted combination of plots that capture the very pulp of society that are evident in its title. The plot is a non-linear combination of three main stories that intertwine with the five main characters popping in and out of all of them. All three of the stories are very simplistic in theory and purposely made stereotypical by Tarantino. However, his goal was to take these classic mobster stories and add a twist to all of them. It is these aspects of Tarantino's stories that change the formula from something generic and unoriginal to three of the most intense and memorable stories of film history. The glue that progresses and ties all of these stories together is the sharp natural dialogue that Tarantino is so well known for. He is at the top of his game in Pulp Fiction providing the most natural and genuinely interesting dialogue that not only serves as something to listen to, but also actually progresses the story just as much as the character's actions do. These actions are actually what the film is most criticized for with the movie being rated R for almost everything. Some claim that the movie is just an excuse to set up extreme situations of violence and substance abuse. This has caused the film to be known for its excessive and brutal nature. However, when paying closer attention, it is quite easy to see that it is largely a story of redemption. Since the film revolves around less than moral individuals, it is not surprising to say that everyone who is killed in this movie could easily be considered a ""bad person"" but when examined, one will notice that every character that seeks forgiveness for their actions is alive when the credits roll. The soupy morals and excessive nature are what this movie is known for. For good reasons too, further supporting the choice for the title of the movie. However, the reason this movie has reached a certain level of greatness over the years is not only from its drugs and violence but also from its tangled story superb dialogue. With Pulp Fiction being the masterpiece of a director as talented as Quentin Tarantino, any movie fan owes it to themselves to see it."
06/06/2016,9,"I just had to take a minute and comment on this film. I think it was shockingly bad. I really like Tarantino's other films/True Romance is a masterpiece. then he goes and makes this disjointed piece of crap? I guess people get bored telling a good, simple story like. Uma Thurman stole every scene she was in. John Travolta was revolting and I was embarrassed for him trying so hard to act so cool throughout this thing. give me a break!! the whole thing with the rape defines gratuitous violence for the sake of what? trying to prove how tough someone can be? yeah, OK. the whole movie had this trying-desperately-hard-to-be-ultra-cool. all I can say is this film is OVERKILL in a big way. some scenes are OK but most of it should have been scraped. that people like this film as much as they do is a sad commentary on good film making and what people now a days will call brilliant. it's all a.d.d./mtv-pandering to those with the attention span of a gnat."
03/06/2016,9,"Indeed, Pulp Fiction operates in the hinterland between reality and movie reality. Into a cadre of movie archetypes — the assassin, the mob boss, the gangster's moll, the boxer who throws a fight — Tarantino injects a reality check that is as funny as it is refreshing. Whereas most crime flicks would breeze over the rendezvous between Vincent and Mia, here we actually get to go on the date— polite chit-chat, awkward silences, bad dancing — before it spirals off into a drugged- up disaster. Just as Dogs is a heist film where you don't see the heist, Pulp is a boxer-takes-a- dive flick where you never see the bout, opting instead for conversations about muffins and Deliverance-style rape. Moreover, after Vincent and Jules take back Marsellus' briefcase, rather than cutting to a cop on their trail, we stay with them and revel in their banal banter as they dispose of a corpse (the genius of Keitel's Wolf in this effort is a moot point — how much intelligence does it take <> to clean a car, then throw a rug over the back seat?)"
25/05/2016,1,"I have only seen this movie once, during the original theatrical release, so maybe I'm due for a second viewing, but I just don't get it.  Yes, it's misogynistic, racist, hyper-violent, and near as I can tell --devoid of any redeeming social value: but these seem to be the high points!  Yes there were some funny bits, particularly Christopher Walken and the thing about the watch.  Yes Mr. Tarantino coaxed some very good performances out of some fairly mediocre actors, and yes they were aided by one very capable actor (Samuel L. Jackson).  What I don't get is the way everyone seems so enamored of the dialog.  As I recall, it competed for an Oscar that year with Much Ado About Nothing, starring a guy named Denzel Washington, written by a guy named Bill Shakespeare, and the best line from this 154 min. glamorization of our baser instincts seems to be ""What do they call a quarter-pounder with cheese?"" !!!????? As for interleaving plots, I'm wondering if any of the folks so taken with this have ever seen anything made by Robert Altman?  I wouldn't object to the violence so much if it made me think (The Matrix, Memento) or feel (Road to Perdition) something, but unfortunately, this film offered me neither."
24/05/2016,1,Some off the best cinematography of the 90's with the direction/writing from one of the greats. The ensemble cast and colorful dialogue will stand the test of time in cinema.
24/05/2016,1,Just to keep it short and sweet. Its a great film so just watch it!! I saw it at the cinema when it first came out and was like WTF. Still after 25 years I watch it when its on and totally enjoy
20/05/2016,1,"Tarantino movies offers the fresh new perspective to storytelling. Showing the audience the story via each character's point of view, but with a twist. Flashback/forward, each action affects the other scenes, and, in the end, comes together for an ah-ha moment and the realization that everyone has a different perspective in the circle of life. While there are many shocker moments, the ends seems to offer a gritty tale of life in the underworld crime."
19/05/2016,1,"I'm not an expert in cinema but I find this film exeptional because of its characters, of its script and its dialog. Honestly I can watch this film all day and I will still find it insane. But do you really need my opinion to watch it ? Go watch it immediatly if you didn't"
13/05/2016,1,"Relatively close to the beginning of my deep-dive into cinema - you know, writing reviews and all - Quentin Tarantino managed to become one of my favorites almost instantly. Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained - all of these really blew me away, and even when watching some of his still-popular-but-not-as-much films, he never missed for me. Needless to say that for several years now I've been wanting to watch this movie, but I haven't, because I wanted to make my way towards it up the IMDb poster. And well, look at that. Here we are, on the second feature we're watching from the top 10. Let's get to it.Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's second film, and it's honestly quite a tough one to explain, plot-wise, without getting into spoilers. Let's try to approach it like this: Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) is a ruthless, cold-blooded mafia boss. Throughout the film we have three stories, each of them related to his shady business. Our three main characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) - a smooth, charming agent under Wallace, Butch (Bruce Willis) - a boxer who has made a dangerous deal with Wallace, and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) - a theatrical, dramatic agent of Wallace who operates alongside Vincent in some of their tasks. Three characters, three interconnected stories.When people think of cool cinema, many of them think of Tarantino, and especially this movie. Tarantino has his way with cool writing, he sure does. Every movie of his I've seen had at least several moments that were really memorable and badass. I wouldn't say that this movie per se is where it shows most - maybe he's still trying too hard, at times, here, considering it's a rather early movie of his, developed from early ideas- but generally, yeah, this movie has some moments that will definitely make you appreciate Tarantino's badass-ness. Something about the casualness of all the violence here (like the old comedy song says, cool guys don't look at explosions) has both comical and awesome nature.The dialogue here plays into this idea of being nonchalantly violent and in danger - characters in life threatening situations can talk about foot massages or coffee like it's nothing. It creates some iconic moments for sure, and this movie is indeed very quotable. Only two significant characters here are poorly written, in my opinion: Winston Wolf and Mia Wallace. Without getting into spoiler territory, I'll just say that the actors (Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman) can do so much better, and pity that they weren't given characters that are fuller, less amateurish.Talking about rough-around-the-edges: the term ""pulp fiction"" refers to books that were provocative, full of sex and violence, but also not so good - only made to sell and entertain. Despite this movie being good, I think that the title does fit it. Just look at the poster - it's like a cover for a book that's supposed to lure you in, stories that teenagers will read and hide because they're supposed to only be for adults. The short-story structure, the general violence and crudeness, how it tries to appeal to guys more than to gals. In the end of the day, it is what it is - a fun film, an entertaining one, but far from being a life altering experience for me.The soundtrack is great, as always. Tarantino has some of the most iconic soundtracks out there, and not only because he picks good songs, but because he knows how to make it fit to the scene perfectly. Usually they have some cool subtext, and they just turn the iconic-meter up almost every time. Always memorable soundtracks.The structure of this movie is unusual, and it's definitely one of the things that it's famous for. It's a cool idea, and though it disturbs the momentum of the movie a little bit it's nothing serious. I do feel like it makes everything a little messier, less consistent, but it's not necessarily a bad thing - this is sort of the point, and I can appreciate that, for better or worse. I also feel like the gold watch story was better than the other ones, btw, but it's not that big of a gap in quality.To sum it up: Pulp Fiction fits its title very, very well - just like a pulp magazine, this movie is a little rough around the edges, but fun and entertaining nonetheless. From the classic poster to the dialogue - everything is screaming violent, crude, hot pulp fiction, and I kinda like it overall, despite (any maybe also because of) its roughness. Feeling a 7.6/10 on this one."
13/05/2016,1,"""Pulp Fiction"" has two things going for it; Sam Jackson(robbed at the Oscars) and Christopher Walken(who has the film's funniest sequence. But that's all. The Tim Roth/Amanda Plummer scenes are irritating and too profane(swearing's great, but not like this). The Bruce Willis ""Gimp"" scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know the one) is absolutely unbearable. She and Travolta(too fat to dance and never a terrific actor) almost ruin this 1994 Tarantino film single handedly. But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, it's excessive, the way the three stories are told is confusing, and...that's about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as Marsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me. I know many like Tarantino, but I think he's a show-off in the grand tradition of John Woo(one of his heroes apparently)."
12/05/2016,1,"I loved this madcap yarn about 2 hitmen for the mob, a mobster's nutty girlfriend, a punch drunk boxer, and 2 ineffective bandits. The story was told in flashback form, a technique that I have always found interesting. The lives of all the players criss-cross with each other forming a collection a mini-stories guaranteed to captivate the viewer. Unusually done film, very entertaining."
12/05/2016,1,"Well, I finally saw 'Pulp Fiction'. Hadn't after all this time, but I've heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented it.UGH.I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didn't appreciate the 'art' of this film, or its 'brilliance', or any 'statement' it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em."
12/05/2016,1,"A movie with no real solid plot, Pulp Fiction launches you smack dab in the middle of the happenings and the inter-connectedness of a group of characters. Structured unusually and executed freely, the movie is deliciously cliched and groundbreaking all at once. It offers a careless normalcy to violence and crime and expresses this through the sickly humor. Tarantino becomes the master of creating so much with so little, which is especially evident in the pointless yet captivating dialogue, and with the drawn out but mesmerizing shot composition. It's over the top but hell that's the fun of it all."
11/05/2016,1,"Going into this for the first time, I knew this would be a good movie and I would enjoy it. However, I had no idea that it would be this good. It practically blew me away.This movie follows how 6 people's lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence, drug-use, and murder.What this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive. When I first saw the beginning, I didn't think much of it and as the film progressed, I forgot about it. But when it comes back at the ending, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot. I was in awe when the credits first started to roll.Also, this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic. It is also very well-done too. I honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie. Like Jaws, when I think of this movie, the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head. It may not be as iconic as Jaws's music but it definitely is of equal quality.Also, the acting couldn't be much better. In my opinion, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis all gave perfect performances. They are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they couldn't do any better.This movie also has very great repeat watchability to it. The first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable. But just like Fight Club, this movie gets better and better every time you watch it. Mainly because the fact that you know what's going to happen and that you know all of its surprises, makes several scenes even more engaging. Also, this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes. It's super rare for a film to have 2 iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture.So in conclusion, this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons. It has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over 20 years. I think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also. I think that this is Tarantino's best film and I also think that it is one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies."
10/05/2016,1,"This is a tour de force of brilliantly precise screen writing, perfect acting, precise camera-work, perfect directing and world class dialogue writing. 'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.Some people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. But as far as I'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how Tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. In a nutshell........ yeah, 'Pulp Fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er."
09/05/2016,1,"The representative works of non-linear narrative films. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, and the dialogue is wonderful. Everyone in the film has a good quality, but they are hopelessly towards the dark and confused. Each paragraph is not divided into the beginning and the end, complementary structure, the beginning and the end of the connection, suggesting that the reality of similar movies in the plot is always happening, never stop. Line: why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find someone really special can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence."
24/04/2016,5,"Sorry if I comparing this movie with a video game (thats released far after the the movie and with completely different stories tho) but...If you enjoy playing GTA - San Andreas, then you would love this movie!"
23/04/2016,5,"Nerd Quentin shot his load in making this film. Geeks who never saw real violence were given the pleasure and permission to laugh as caricature humans get blown away on screen. Quent tapped into an audience who would never have to go to war and were sheltered from the more brutal realities of the American underclass. And you know what? Those people getting killed on screen WERE the audience. A little film from a little man that excited little people. That about sums it up for me, but apparently IMDb values verbosity so i gotta write 5 more lines.1)It 2)really 3)IS 4)""Pulp5)Fiction"""
11/04/2016,4,"Pulp Fiction made Quentin Tarantino who he is today. He showed us what he was capable of with Reservoir Dogs, but with Pulp Fiction, he made his mark in cinema and it will stay there forever. I love Pulp Fiction, I love it so much. It's just one of those movies I could watch on repeat for the rest of my life and I wouldn't mind it. But what makes it so great? It's basically just a bunch of people talking, the entire movie. But it so well scripted and directed, the Pulp Fiction script is perhaps the best script ever written. Royale with Cheese? Hell yeah! Everyone in film school should read the script to this masterpiece. Needless to say, all the actors in the film have reached iconic status and deliver great performances. Pulp Fiction is one of the most iconic movies of all time. What makes it so great for me is the fact that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of random stuff that happens and it has a great script, that's it. But to make a movie about nothing and make it one of the greatest, most entertaining films of all time, is an achievement. Thank you, Quentin Tarantino. Thank you.Written and directed by Tarantino, it's considered by many to be one of the most influential and best movies of all time. In my opinion, it is the best written film of all time. Pulp Fiction is a film driven almost completely by its dialogue: It's two and a half hours of mostly people talking and one would think that's a negative but the dialogue is extremely clever and engaging. The performances are brilliant as it features a pitch perfect cast. The directing choices are awesome, the cinematography is perfect for what it needs to be and you can't talk about Pulp Fiction without mentioning the soundtrack. Possibly the greatest soundtrack in a movie ever. The dialogue is so good it features so much quotable dialogue.I'm a big fan of structure in most movies but the beautiful thing about Pulp Fiction is that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of stories mixed together to create an entertaining film about gangsters, dancing the twist and foot massages. There is only one scene in Pulp Fiction I dislike, because I really feel it does not advance the plot and it feels like it slows the movie down for me and that is when Butch and his girlfriend are in the hotel room at night. The scene lasts like 5 minutes only at it feels like it could have been trimmed to two. However, this is really a minor detail. Pulp Fiction is one of the most entertaining movies ever made and it is an essential viewing for any film lover in general.9.7/10"
25/02/2016,8,"Plenty of people love this movie. They rave about how original, cool and funny it is. I will admit that there is a lot to see in Avary and Tarantino's script including plenty of off beat cameo roles. I really liked Samuel Jackson's character. Not only was the performance excellent but the depth of what he was dealing with was very powerful. The rest of the movie I wasn't so happy with. Pulp Fiction has some original story ideas. But if you compare it to Goodfellas which also has flashbacks, slow motion and sick humor it doesn't look that original. But I will admit that the story in Pulp Fiction is done in a somewhat original way. Moving down from here we have the Bruce Willis role. It is very powerful but so graphically violent that like Blue Velvet it becomes too much after a while. Down from here we have Uma Thurman's part which I felt was filling time. I didn't think that much of Travolta either. As for the so called great humor, I did not laugh at the scene in the car which just about tells the story for me. Finally about Tarantino. If he is going to have a great career in this business, he will need to write dialogue in which every other line doesn't have the ""N"" word and also where the climax of each scene isn't filled with buckets of blood. Without the shock value I wonder if he is that good. I thought Jackie Brown was only a little above average but better than Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction presents a few effective, original moments and has a great performance by Samuel Jackson. Otherwise it piles on the violence, blood and racial slurs hoping to shock but turning out just to be overdone."
28/01/2016,8,"In Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino uses completely original characters in a plot so original and spellbinding that the final result is th greatest film of all time.  The way he is able to separate the plot into vignettes is brilliant.  Additionally, the hidden imagery adds to the overall depth of the movie."
26/01/2016,8,"Let me start by saying that I love gangster films and film noir. I believe I see them all. So I went to see this when it came out because some Oz friends of mine highly recommended it. The film starts out well enough. (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's performances gave me high hopes). Needless to say from there there was long, long 160 minute spiral out of control. An all-star cast and a great soundtrack notwithstanding. I just didn't ""get it"" then...and frankly I still don't. I have enjoyed a few of Tarantino's other films, but this one was just vile. I can't recommend it, but I do believe in to each his/her own. Watch at your own risk."
20/01/2016,8,"Today I just heard about the death of Dee Dee Ramone, and after getting over the initial shock, it made me think about 'Pulp Fiction'. This ground breaking movie, much like the ground breaking music of the Ramones, has been endlessly discussed, praised, damned, ripped off and copied so many times that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genuinely original, exciting and important work of art that when experienced for the umpteenth time STILL never fails to thrill and amuse. The many talentless punk bands who have recycled watered down and witless imitations of Da Brudders music haven't made 'Rocket To Russia' any less brilliant, only more so. The same thing goes with Quentin Tarantino's countless less talented followers. They just make you appreciate 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' even more.This movie is one of the few I would describe as perfect. I honestly cannot fault a thing about it. The brilliant dialogue has become legendary, the elliptical structure of the script (though influenced by Kubrick's 'The Killing', and the experiments of the French New Wave) has been much imitated and will continue to do so, the fantastic group of actors, who range from has-beens (at the time) to cult favourites, are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is one of the coolest and most eclectic ever assembled. In short, this is a modern classic, and required viewing for all movie buffs, especially 70s nuts like myself. 'Pulp Fiction' is as good as any movie you care to name. To (mis)quote Flavor Flav - ""believe the hype!"""
15/01/2016,8,"I really love this Tarantino classic, the cast is amazing. I really love how much this film explores different types of crime. I really loved the partnership of Jules and Vincent also Honey bunny and Pumpkin were just perfect together. The opening scene to this film is one of the best I have seen."
12/01/2016,8,"I remember as a kid my Mom watched this movie when it came out (I was 10) and my brother and I were playing video games downstairs and we could hear my mom laughing upstairs and wanted to know what was so funny. But we knew it was a rate R movie and we couldn't go watch. Well I was so relieved and triumphant feeling when I was finally old enough to see it. It held up really well!! Tarantino may be a creep, and may have issues with acknowledging his whiteness and all but he does know hot to put together a decent movie. Perhaps one of the biggest accomplishments of this film in particular was reviving some Hollywood has-beens. John Travolta's career was 5 and a half feet under and Pulp Fiction basically revived him. He also threw in Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette who were not really super relevant anymore. I think at least when I saw this movie for the first time I also saw Bruce Willis in a darker role than I had previously seen him. I appreciate that Tarantino uses actors in ways we are not always used to seeing them. This movie has great action, good cutting between storylines, entertaining dialogue and per usual a killer soundtrack and of course plenty of the shock value we know to expect from his movies at the time. This is probably his best film for sure."
04/01/2016,9,"Pulp Fiction is a movie of our times - fast moving, exciting but gratuitous and ultimately meaningless. This movie has pace! It moves along from the opening scene at great speed and it's never anything less than thrilling. There are stories within stories throughout the movie. Several funny moments. And many violent scenes. And that's my problem with this film. It seems to glorify (or at least casualise) violence. A kid's face is blown off by mistake - and our heroes only worry that his splattered brains spoils their hair. But it's all very entertaining - just a bit immoral and it doesn't really have anything to say except that Tarrentino has a fascination for meaningless violence. Entertainment value is 9/10. But I gave it 8."
31/12/2015,8,"Pulp Fiction (1994) is a crime movie written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. The movie tells different stories about two hitmen, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and two diner bandits. It is famous for its non-linear story, violent scenes, and dark humor.I like cinematography. I like how Tarantino captures the shots of actors in different camera shots and they maintain very good depth. The cinematography per se is rich. What is more it has very diverse locations adding more richness and depth to the movie. It's just great. The cinematography is simple and effective and it's not over exaggerated with any unnecessary transitions and rapid camera movements. It goes with the flow. That is why in my opinion the movie is 2h 35min long. The movie tries to make the movie ""feel"" the movie. I love the camera movements during the dramatic scenes, it's just unique. The whole pace of the movie is slow since it also tries to showcase the character development in the movie and more dialogue focused.The screenplay is interesting. It has some witty lines and dramatic sequences and vice versa. It's a unique blend for this movie. I also like the romantic relationship development in the movie. I like how the story is separated into 2-3 different stories with its own unique focus and later those stories come together. The plot gets more complex and explicit, and the film itself is utterly insane. A Grand Theft Auto (GTA) vibe infuses this film.The acting is very good, especially the character development. Accents are clear. The acting feels very genuine and I especially like the dramatic scenes seeking solutions while being emotional. I liked one scene with the dancing part in this movie and for me, it was just gold. I loved it and I was entertained. It brought positive vibes. Of course not all of the movie was like this, there were many dramatic scenes that were just shocking and literally criminal. Moreover, I'm very impressed that the director of the movie himself was an actor in this movie. He did a great job!The film's music selection complements its old-school vibe perfectly. Lastly, the ending is witty, thought-provoking, and complex, marking Pulp Fiction' as a distinctly original film in the landscape of cinema.In short, ""Pulp Fiction"" is notable for its deliberate speed, in-depth character growth, and story centered around conversations. Quentin Tarantino's great camera work and the film's different places make it more interesting. The script cleverly combines humor and drama. The performances are fantastic, especially the memorable dance scenes and Tarantino's acting. The old school music makes the movie feel better. ""Pulp Fiction"" has per se a complex and thought-provoking story that makes a standout film. It showcases Tarantino's unique vision and storytelling skills."
25/12/2015,8,"Pulp fiction is one of the best movies I have ever seen, I first watched the movie a year ago and wasn't too fond of it but once I watched it again a few months leather I was blown away. The stories and roles played by the actors are brilliant, every role is played to perfection and the story keeps you enticed throughout the film. If you have not seen this movie you need to"
23/12/2015,7,"I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend because she had seen it with some friends and said it was so good. I made it through the whole thing SOMEHOW, and as we were walking through the parking lot I just started thinking that this movie has sucked over 2 hours of life from me and I'll never get it back. I honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing. There is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast (NOT Travolta nor Thurman) and their ability was limited due to the awful script. There is nothing groundbreaking about this movie, the dialog is boring, the characters have no depth. It seems like it was made on a 24 hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an ""F"" word anywhere there was a space. I wouldn't have cared less if Tarantino had had another character that built an atomic bomb that accidentally detonated and wiped out everyone in this collection of trash. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen, especially for something so highly praised."
20/12/2015,7,While most films will be highlighted and soon after disappear throughout time Pulp Fiction will stand out as a unique raw film in it's story dynamic and diverse character base.
18/12/2015,7,This movie certainly deserves the rating of 8.9 and deserves its spot ranked as the #7 movie of all time. Everything is fantastic in this masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino does a fantastic job directing this and not one actor or actress in the movie disappoints me. I personally love the plot of the three different stories that revolve around Marsellus Wallace. This films doesn't leave time for the viewer to be bored while watching since it is so pack full of complex and entertaining characters that bring their witty comments to the screen. There almost seems to be a natural flow between some characters and that draws you in and doesn't let you go for a second.
18/12/2015,7,"From the point of view of the structure of the play, quentin abandoned the traditional Hollywood way, and with the technique of separating the points of view, the whole film narrative treatment into a kind of echo ""circular structure"". In this novel overall structure, every story in ""pulp fiction"" is told coherently. What's neat about pulp fiction's narrative structure is that it overturns the conventional notion of linear time and space without losing a large audience by being too experimental.
In pulp fiction, violence often goes hand in hand with black humor, and black humor can be surprising and unimaginable, but what makes pulp fiction unique is that it depicts the Christian faith. The film was cut to pieces by the director to cover up the truth that people should have faith."
18/12/2015,7,"Tarantino once again did it.It's Not wrong to say this is definitely the best movie of the century.Even now days this movie still have something unique. It's like every time you watch it there's a surprise to come. Totally Worth it.The script, awarded with the Oscars, is full of surprises, smart dialogues, what the f... moments, gore and violence, all which Tarantino's fans are completely used to. The acting, includes John Travolta as never he been before. Samuel L Jackson in his best performance ever and Uma Thurman,this actress steals every moment she appears on screen. Also this movie has the most iconic dance scene of the movies. Worth your while!"
17/12/2015,7,"Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies. Prizefighter Butch Coolidge has decided to stop payment on a deal he's made with the devil. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue. Meanwhile, two career criminals, Vincent Vega and Jules, go about their daily business of shooting up other crooks that are late on payments to their boss. While one is asked to baby sit their boss' dangerously pretty young wife, the other suddenly realizes that he must give up his life of crime."
16/12/2015,7,"No words can describe how great of a movie this is, This will always be in my top 10 list! If you have never seen it then your life is meaningless. Must watch ASAP!"
14/12/2015,7,This movie is the ultimate marmite movie. You will either love it or hate it. And if like me you love it you won't be able to get enough of it. Its probably the most hardest movie to review to someone who hasn't seen it. It's got to be seen to be understood and I absolutely suggest it
13/12/2015,7,"The film's presentation style is very beautiful, based on a non-linear narrative narration that shows you a different arrangement than the logical arrangement of events. The film starts with a scene from the end of the film and vice versa.
Secondly, the characters built Quentin Tarentino characters with logical diagonal diagonal proportions in characters and for seriousness in other characters in addition to the amazingly written dialogues that gave the characters depth and deep dimension"
09/12/2015,8,"This movie is one of Tarantino's best movies I've ever seen. It is on a par with Django Unchained. You will enjoy how he uses his characters to eloquently describe the situation and go along with it. And those unexpected accidents that occur throughout the film are way too humorous and entertaining. The non-linearity of the script is the key feature of the film's success. We wouldn't have liked it, if the screenplay had been linear. Oh, and need I mention about the soundtracks? They seemed like they were composed originally for the scenes. No wonder, Tarantino got an Oscar for the screenplay! I'm giving it a 10, because the movie deserves it."
02/12/2015,7,"In my opinion, the greatest movie of all time. It makes people laugh and keeps them engaged at the same time. Hope Quentin Tarantino makes his last movie better than this and win Best Picture and/or Best Director. Seriously, the jokes in this movies make you laugh till you cry."
23/11/2015,10,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE, amazing, normally i hate the long movies, but this one caught me from beginning to the end, a masterpiece. I loved the characters, specially Vincent, he's super authentic and memorable."
23/11/2015,10,"This is Quentin Tarantino at his best, he is known for writing some amazing dialogue and I must say the dialogue in this is just brilliant and none of it is wasted, it's witty, entertaining and observant. I personally think this is the film that made Samuel L. Jackson as this crazy badass. This is simply Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece that needs to be watched if your a movie lover. Definitely one of the best films of the 90's, and deserves to be in anyone's movie collection cause it just ain't one without this. This really is a true original, some complain that this film is a bit overrated but let me tell you this deserves to be overrated. Yeah sure there is no deep message behind this movie, but who cares.9.4/10"
18/11/2015,10,"This is a superb movie and definitely one of my favorites of all time.The action is intense and highly entertaining, the characters cool but mortal, the acting close to perfect by an all star cast that shines throughout ,the dialogues  clever and Tarantino's disturbed genius provides a cinematic spectacle not to be missed by any fan of the art.The film has everything except from ""true love"".You can find the non stop struggle to survive or to gain power and money ,sex ,drugs, rock and roll,an instantly ""classic"" dance scene,moral dilemmas,clever back and forth plot twists even touches of distorted romance and existential concerns.The pace ranges from slow to frantic..   Maybe there is too much violence for the conservative viewer.But who needs conservatism when it comes to judging art? The creative madness of the gifted director in this gangster film combines humor , coolness , realism and an almost cartoonish at times surrealism accompanied by a suitable soundtrack that contributes immensely to the whole larger than life atmosphere.The heroes are likeable and their strengths and weaknesses despite their seemingly cool behavior are exposed in their moments of glory and decline (not necessarily in a chronological order) in a masterful manner. Chance can determine their fate and nobody is above the realities of a cruel merciless world in their quest for well, hedonism rather than happiness...No faults,just sheer cinematic enjoyment for the open minded cinema lover..10 out of 10..."
18/11/2015,10,"This is a cinematic masterpiece. It is nothing short of brilliant and an incredible contribution to international cinema. It contains, arguably the funniest and wittiest dialogue ever in a film. Everybody in the world should see this movie. No matter what age. 5 stars"
16/11/2015,10,"Fasten your seat belts we are about to enter the dark realm of hyper hype. I just don't get it. I have seen a lot of movies and this one....well, I am far off from the norm (of ratings). A 4 out of 10!First off, I don't like how the violence is glorified. Vince and Jules are just too cool. HEY,PEOPLE THEY ARE KILLERS! Movie fans treat them like fans of Mickey and Mallory in Natural Born Killers. WOW, THEY ARE COOL AND FUNNY! BRILLIANT PERFORMANCES BRAVO! (DUDES). In this picture show, the good guys are ruthless, mean, brutal, murdering outlaws and they do it with a twinkle in their eye. Not realistic. I am amazed at the number of people who love this movie. It must be the phenomena of when you tell drunk jokes to a drunk; they love it.I am not one of those pristine few who believe that movies should have no violence. Many of favorite movies are violent.The part where Travolta blows a guy's head off is not funny to me nor is the one with Jackson and Travolta killing people in the beginning. The drug overdose with Uma and the needle slamming into her chest is not funny or entertaining and yep, I always laugh and watch rape and sodomy for entertainment. Jackson and Willis are the highlights in the movie to me. They give a little moxy to the flick but they can't save it. I did love seeing John Travolta returning to the dance floor (very clever), but it was not enough to keep this movie ""stayin alive"". The movie ranked up their with professional wrestling. I almost had to kick my own ass for watching all of it. I pulled the plug on this one before it made a vegetable out of me.The plot is anemic. The violence is the steak and the plot is not even a baked potato side order. The plot clings to this Hollywood entree like wilted parsley. In the end ,just like food, it all does come together and should be flushed down just like last nights supper.If I had to watch it again I think I would get a blow torch and some pliers and get medieval on some pulp video."
06/11/2015,10,"The self-concern, the odd structure, the homage to pastiche led critics to describe it as the quintessence of postmodernism. PF is considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. It features Tarantino's typical irony, humour and violence. While TriStar Pictures found the script ""too demented,"" Miramax was enthralled, and fully financed it. It was a major critical and commercial success. Its development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema. Yet PF is repulsive, pointlessly tricky to follow on purpose, violent and filthy to an extreme, a long-winded spectacle of gore. I felt shame for the 'humour' in inappropriate moments."
29/10/2015,10,"Everyone knows that this is one of the most innovative films of the last several decades. Everyone knows that the dialogue is great, and that the non-linear narrative structure is unique and ground-breaking.  And as much attention as Travolta and Samuel L. get, which is deserved, I must say that Christopher Walken's scene in the movie is my favorite. I would go so far as to say that I think it is the best monologue in history. Sorry Shakespeare, not even ""to be or not to be"" could ever be as perfect as Captain Koons' story of the Gold Watch.  Anyone who doesn't agree should be shaved and sterilized.  Is that Edward Towers?"
28/10/2015,10,"It simply does not get more real than Pulp Fiction. The way in which the characters talk to each other is the closer to street reality than 99 out of 100 movies. While the story missed one crucial and necessary scene, (a necessary Travolta/Thurman rendezvous), QT perfectly tied all of the stars together in one magic eight ball of both freedom and confusion. All the while somehow managing to portray each scene with an ease of comfort-ability, as if the actors knew they were gonna to be OK after he yells ""cut"". Cameos galore, each twist and turn brought a new multifaceted array of questions to the viewer, while simultaneously answering the previous doubts with a known face in an unknown life form, languished in the agony of drug addicted L.A. with a Hollywood sense of humor. All the viewer is left with after each scene is, how can any scene be better than that one? And thanks to Samuel L. Jackson's and John Travolta's dynamic and cosmic sense of irony, the film culminates in an orgasm of serotonin laced happiness, Tarantino matching music with motion as only he can do. Drugs, Guns, Sex, and Samuel L. 'Nuff Said. (9/10)"
22/10/2015,10,i love this movie but can somebody please tell me what is in the briefcase. John travolta and samuel jackson give the best performances of thier careers.  Also Quentin makes one of the best films of our time.  A movie that should be seen by all.
17/10/2015,10,"I saw this on DVD recently, and was really pleased with it. From the opening scene with ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" until the last scene, I was glued to the screen. Seeing all the big names interact was a lot of fun. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and more. All the characters had an important part in the story. No minor roles, and all of them should have been given an award! The scene with the ""gimp"" was a bit disturbing, but it didn't hurt the viewing. Tarentino's films are always gripping your attention and holding it until the last credit goes by. I highly recommend this movie. Be sure to get the DVD with the extras, and you will enjoy your night in front of the television. Start dancing the ""bat-tusi"" and have fun!"
10/08/2015,6,"To me this movie has it all, a great premise, a clever script, and a wonderful storyteller in Tarantino. The acting is superb, but truly it didn't even need to be all that great. With so many lines which will be repeated long after you see this movie, it is pretty much an instant classic.I've seen Pulp Fiction more times than I can count (Probably about 50) and it's the only film that I can still get joy out of after seeing it that many times. I was terribly confused as to what transpired the first time I saw it, but then after a few more viewings I began to realize the genius in this film isn't that Tarantino makes the viewer understand the film, he makes the viewer love it. From the ""Big brain on Brad"" scene until the ""Bad Mother F--ker"" scene, this movie aims to please. In that sense it is probably the anti-classic, but since we already have a surplus of sex, drugs, and violence in film and on television why not just roll them all into one, multiply by one hundred, and make a movie out of it.Unfortunately this will probably be Tarantino's last great film judging from the pathetic aftershock which turned out to be Jackie Brown."
24/07/2015,9,"Love this film and watching it on the bigscreen cements a life long passion. Incredible film that deserves all the glory it receives. Funny and full of memorable performances, there are no slouching on this film. The gave birth to a wave of copycats and quite possibly an entire new genre. Strong filmmaking."
03/07/2015,9,"I just bought the ""Pulp Fiction"" Collector's Edition DVD boxed set, and I was glad I did.  Not only does it include this great movie, but it also contains an interview with Quentin Tarantino on the ""Charlie Rose"" show, an interview with him and Michael Moore at the Independent Spirit Awards and even a Trivia Track.  It would've been way cool if it included director's or actors' commentary, but I still felt it was worth my money--especially since I got it for a good price at $19.99.Anyways, back to the movie.  This is an inspired, truly original work of art that doesn't appear like the traditional work of art.  This can be considered an art film, but it's not an art film that bores you with pretention after pretention and has almost no momentum to keep it going. This film has plenty of momentum.  Even at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I had trouble hitting the ""Pause"" button.First of all, the cast is topnotch.  As many know, this is the film that re-launched John Travolta's career.  And that's great, being that he's one hell of an actor, and this is one of his best performances--the ultra-cool Vincent Vega.  Ironically enough, he was only paid about 10,000 dollars (give or take) for this movie, being that it was shot on a modest budget--though it rarely shows.  And now he's a multi-millionaire.  I think Travolta owes more than a ""thank you"" to Mr. Tarantino.  Samuel L. Jackson is also terrific as the ultra-hip Jules Winnfield.  He has some of the best lines, which I will get to later.  Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances, showing that as well as a great movie star he's also a terrific actor.  Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are great in the opening and closing scenes, though I wish their accents could've been a tad less thick. Harvey Keitel makes a moderately short but memorable appearance.  Ving Rhames is thoroughly convincing as the terrifyingly evil Marscellus Wallace. Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette have some funny moments as Travolta's drug-dealing buddies.  And Uma Thurman--though not a very beautiful actress--is perfect as the free-spirited, coke-snorting Mia Wallace.
My favorite element of this movie?  (And I'm sure I'm not alone on this one) The dialogue, of course!  ""Pulp Fiction"" has some of the most memorable dialogue in movie history.  Tarantino has an incredible knack for writing dialogue, as shown before in movies like ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""True Romance"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn.""  After watching this movie twice (since purachasing the DVD), there are some lines I simply cannot shake out my head.  These are some of my favorite quotes:""My name is Pitt, and yo a*s ain't talkin' your way out of this s**t.""""Does he look like a b**ch?  I said, 'Does he look like a b**ch!'""(After the cab driver asks Butch--Bruce Willis--what his name means) ""This is America.  Our names don't mean s**t.""""Pulp Fiction"" is the perfect balance of dark comedy, crime drama, romance and action.  It's a wild, perfectly enjoyable ride that you will never forget.  OK, so this movie does go into the love-it-or-hate-it category. I personally love the movie, but there is the minority that don't think too much of ""PF.""  Whenever you have a movie that's 2 hours and 30 minutes long, packed with dialogue, packed with profanity and doesn't bombard its audience with gratuitous visuals, you can't expect everybody to embrace it with open arms.  In a short while, I've fell in love with Tarantino's unique, realistic and profane writing/directorial style.  Others can't quite handle it.  I still don't understand the whole violence issue.  In the average movie, you see about 20 guys getting blown away with machine guns all within a 3-minute scene.  Most of the violence here is left to the imagination. Well, I guess people have a strong imagination.My only criticisms are a few slow moments and one cheesy attempt at rear-screen projection (during the Bruce Willis cab scene) in which the cab is obviously not moving and you see black-and-white footage (probably from an old movie) in the background.  But I still consider this a great movie, and one I'm proud to include in my DVD collection.  I can't wait 'til the Special Edition of ""Reservoir Dogs"" comes out this week, so can buy it and the ""Jackie Brown"" DVD to complete my Tarantino collection.  And is the soundtrack great or what!  I actually bought the soundtrack before I bought the movie, and I fell in love with the music just as much.  It includes such greats as Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" and ""Jungle Boogie.""  And who can forget that great ""Pulp Fiction"" theme?  It was interesting to find out that the song wasn't composed specifically for this movie, and that it did actually exist beforehand.My score:  9 (out of 10)"
10/03/2015,1,"Saw this at the cinema as a rerelease despite having seen it many times it's still worth a watch on the big screen.One thing I love about this film is you always notice something new, tonight I learned Steve Buscemi is it!Still brilliant and still worth a few hours of anyone's time"
27/02/2015,8,"When Quentin Tarantino finds the balance between violance, suspens and story line you get masterpieces. This is a masterpiece that should be in the TOP10 films ever."
15/02/2015,8,"Unique film structure, entertaining characters, and much more are present in this Tarantino classic. I find myself always wanting to watch this movie more and more to find new details. Arguably one of the greatest films to ever be released."
01/02/2015,8,"Tarantino really nails it with this all-time classic. There is really nothing wrong with this movie, the acting is amazing, with Samuel Jackson giving his best performance ever. The story is immaculate and the directing is unbeatable! The editing and directing go hand-in-hand with the unique pacing and grueling dialog. Tarantino definitely is the master behind a camera. There are twist and turns throughout this movie that make your head spin! The long dialog scenes reads Tarantino all over it, and also the thick blood and crazy death scenes. I give this movie a 10/10 because it really shows what great acting, editing, camera work, and directing can do to create such a perfect movie."
27/01/2015,8,"This film typifies what is wrong with the whole film world today. When a morally bankrupt,intellectually challenged creep like the ""director"" of this piece can get a deal with a major studio it says a lot about the sad and pathetic state of movie making. The level of hype surrounding this and the other (place epithet here) made by this twerp is disgusting. What drugs are being passed around in Hollywood board rooms? I'd really like to know what kind of hallucinogenic it was. I saw this (place epithet here) and I was disturbed in the way it manipulates the stupider members of the audience. Getting high on violence is a good thing? Tarantino is a cancerous festering oozing lesion on the anus of the film world. Good film making technique aside, are we really prepared for the level of nihilism this kind of (place epithet here) represents? This is just (place epithet here) elevated to Olympian ""ART FILM"" status. The presence of some reasonably good actors just proves that actors generally have very poor judgement and like the misquote of Hitchcock ""are cattle"". This, and the previously mentioned disease's other films are the absolute ultimate in pandering to the lowest common denominator of the hormonally challenged adolescent male mindset that Hollywood seems to be pervertedly in love with (film school critic retards included). This is only my opinion, but I know other cinema literate people who share it. The fact that this was nominated for Oscars is too abhorrent to bear. Add style and you can serve overrated (place epithet here) to the most pretentious."
22/01/2015,8,"The movie tells us that in life, violence, including wars, boxing, and other forms, is ubiquitous, and there is no justice to life, death, right or wrong in front of it. Under the cover of violence, the film actually explores a more profound issue - the impact of accidental events on human destiny.The three stories mentioned in the script, ""Vincent and Marsha's Wife,"" ""The Golden Watch,"" and ""Bonnie's Situation,"" are actually one story. Mia's drug overdose, Butch's encounter with Martha, Jules's ""miracle"" and robbery in the restaurant are all accidental events in life, and it is these seemingly accidental events that change the fate of the characters."
11/01/2015,8,"I was 11 years old when I saw it, changed my life. I was a child back then and I remembered dreaming about the story but not because of violence or blood but thinking about the story. How ot was written and how it was narrated. Later on my dad explained to me that ivdeo editor does that part of the filmmKing, putting the story together. Even beginning from the end, its all possible in the hands of video editors. So I decided what I wanted to do in life and that was my response to all who asked me: but if you want to make movies why arent you director? Because I seen that the story can be told in 1000different ways. Pulp Fiction changed my young life."
02/01/2015,8,"Now that it's almost 23 years later can we have a level-headed point of view on this movie? The hype machine in 1994 went into maximum overdrive with Pulp Fiction in a way that has rarely been repeated, even in a world over-saturated with easily accessible and multiple forms of media. For years people have regarded Pulp Fiction as if it is somehow far beyond any kind of criticism. It's time for scrutiny.As a 150-minute series of vignettes within vignettes it makes for good entertainment the first few viewings, but I've seen Pulp Fiction from beginning to end about 10 times now and I can honestly say I am done with it.The trashy nature of the stories and the wider world that the characters inhabit is a nice homage to the dime novels of the 1950s and other trash cinema of the era. And I mean trash. Pulp Fiction takes virtually no inspiration from anything with an ounce of class. Don't be fooled by the all-star cast and the larger- than-life characters.For years people have been quoting the screenplay as if it were a breathtaking breakthrough in movie dialogue. It's not. If anything it is far too wordy. The editor should have been a little more liberal in cutting down the talking. There is an utterly pointless interaction between Travolta, Thurman, and Buscemi about a $5 shake that seems to go on forever. It adds absolutely nothing to scene at all and I cringe whenever I hear it. I can't believe I am even wasting my time bringing it up in this review, but it's a good example of frequent nothingness that should have been excised. Tarantino also seems to have an inability to reign in his actors here, leaving them to ham their way over the boundaries which gives many characters an unfocused, disconnected, and confusing riff. Travolta in particular seems off and alienating. He was probably just happy to get work at the time but there's no reason for why the rest of the cast didn't question the overwritten material.It's also very dull to look at. Jack Rabbit Slims appears to be the only set specifically designed for the movie, which is why there is a colorful vibrancy to this scene that is found nowhere else. Almost every other shot takes place at street level in the most mundane parts of Los Angeles without any sense of location. The lazy Panavision photography just plonks the camera down at standard angles and indulges in far too much steadicam for its own good, all while never giving us much in the way of geography. It's very frustrating.Pulp Fiction is competent with unique inspirations, but the movie has almost no original ideas and it has been massively over-regarded for far too long."
06/12/2014,8,"Pulp Fiction is not a good movie I think. It has some enjoyable moments, but it is actually too confusing, because of the time and place´( they ALWAYS change! ). That is not good for a movie, I think. I do not think that it is one of the best 25 films ever. I mean, what is the great thing about that movie? It is just another piece about drugs and killing each other. Come on?! I rated it a 4/10, because it is quite original and has some funny jokes. But it is definitely not that good."
05/12/2014,8,This in my opinion is the best Quentin Tarantino movie ever I have to admit I don't know what was wrong with me that I didn't like this movie at first really don't know what was wrong with me maybe the scenes are slowly detailed but this movie has the best dialogues a really good concept people like the simplicity of this movie that is why this is so good and it's emphasis alone on dialogues and the fact that this movie was made in a really simple time Quentin Tarantino with his best friend Roger Avary managed to do something different something new which makes this movie far better than Kill Bill Vol.1 or Reservoir Dogs those movies don't have what Pulp Fiction has that is why this movie is so good.
03/12/2014,8,"Praised numerous films, in high school did not enjoy it well, today review the heart score in 7.5 or so, also not too high. First of all, the circular structure of the story and the style of black humor make the film very comfortable. There is no big insight, but it presents a very cool attitude towards life, unruly people,and incredible things"
15/11/2014,10,"Samuel L Jackson makes this movie worth watching. His scenes are the best. Rest of the cast is also good but some of the scenes really drag on.
Story is not told in order, but it all comes full circle in the end. There are many shocking moments throughout. Ironically the worst actor in the movie is Tarantino. But his direction and dialogues are great."
06/11/2014,10,"I am so sad I could not see this movie in the theaters as Mr. Tarantino would like, but I was to young to do that and to see this, even if, now, thinking about, it's not so bad for children considering what absolutely (90% of the movies)n nonsense are out there these days. I wish they would invent something as a retro cinema, where you could go and watch movies you never saw in a theather, even if you are alone in that big empty room, I am sure it would not be the case for Pulp Fiction and many other movies. Pulp Fiction is a great movie the 10th time you watch it, but it would blow your mind first time, will make you smile so bad the second time, the third time you will start to see the details and so on... so that begin said keep on watching this movie, is a new discovery every time."
06/11/2014,10,"When Quentin was asked, ""You didn't come up with anything better than Pulp Fiction, did you?""
Quentin replied, ""And who came up with it?""
Wonderful movie! No one can repeat the ""handwriting"" of the master. Incredible dialogues make you laugh. Even a headshot in a car causes real laughter (well, it's not funny in real life).In Russia, this film is very much loved for its originality. This movie is considered a classic and only a fool does not like it. Thank you, Maestro!"
02/11/2014,10,"This is by far tarantino's best work. This film's only flaw is that it is based purely on witty conversation and not on any real action. I could get the same satisfatcion from watching an episode of seinfeld, if i wanted to hear someone discuss the real meaning of a foot massage.However this still remains a fine film and the inner workings of the plot keep one occupied for the two hours."
30/10/2014,10,"Masterfully written, directed. Travolta, Jackson and Uma Thurman are all incredible to watch. Impeccably entertaining. This Tarantino showing what he's capable of achieving and he captures that extremely well. The comedic yet violent tone matches perfectly. I also love how this film is more than one genre.I personally believe this was his best film before Django was released."
28/10/2014,10,"A very good casting and a wonderful soundtrack (Misirlu) !Dialogues are very funny and entertaining.Special mentions to the big 3 : Samuel Lee Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman are brillant and Quentin Tarantino leads them with a good mindset.I like it."
25/10/2014,10,"For a film to be this good is depressing. The words perfection and legendary are thrown around to frequently nowadays but this movie is perfect. It already has legendary status, but its reputation will only further grow as the years pass. Tarantino is a little eccentric, but he is a genius no doubt and the best director of all time. Also add in the great cast...Bruce Willis(very underrated), Sam Jackson(So unique), Uma Thurman(Great actress), Harvey Keitel(legendary supporting actor). This movie revived careers, and changed lives. It changed the way people make movies. How it didn't win every prize and award that year is beyond me. Still, the Palm D'Ór is a fair achievement! If you see one movie before you die, see this!"
18/10/2014,10,"Pulp Fiction, in my opinion, is the Citizen Kane of our generation. It contains so much: gritty crime drama, at times hysterical humor, edge of your seat suspense, incredible acting, and hard to forget scenarios. I think this movie got completely robbed in the Oscar race losing pretty much everything to the highly overrated Forrest Gump. Gump was okay, a great history lesson and decent effects...the story was way lacking. Pulp Fiction deserved all that year. Pulp Fiction is unique in its manner of story telling. It's not your typical Scene A to B format. It goes all over the place and doesn't go in order. It also lets you see things from other peoples perspectives while also knowing what other characters are doing in the background. Like in the beginning sequence as Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are talking you can hear a conversation between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. Travolta even walks past them. Tarantino really had a great idea for this movie and it turned out fantastic. If you haven't seen it go get Pulp Fiction...you will not be disappointed."
16/10/2014,10,"Pulp Fiction is a film as unconventional as a Royale with Cheese in Paris. It's like a wild ride through the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles, a place where mobsters dine on fast food and gory violence is as casual as a conversation about foot massages. It's as unpredictable as a game of Russian roulette and as unapologetically brutal as Butch Coolidge with a katana. But that's the beauty of it - Pulp Fiction doesn't just break the rules; it rewrites them in blood-red ink.So, we've got a cast that's cooler than a cucumber in a snowstorm. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and a whole bunch of other talented folks light up the screen. They play a collection of characters whose stories intersect in the most unexpected and, dare I say, Tarantinoesque ways.The plot? Well, it's like trying to piece together a puzzle while riding a unicycle. Tarantino weaves together a series of interconnected stories that dance between violence and dark humor. It includes a couple of hitmen with a taste for philosophical banter, a boxer on the run, a crime lord's wife with a penchant for temptation, and a mysterious briefcase that glows like the Holy Grail. It's a cocktail of chaos, served with a side of non-linear storytelling, and it's a whole lot of pop culture references.The dialogue is like a verbal choreography of profanity and poetry and the performances are as iconic as a Big Kahuna Burger. Travolta and Jackson are the coolest hitmen you'll ever seen, and their banter is pure gold. Thurman's Mia Wallace is mysterious and captivating, and her dance with Travolta's Vincent Vega is as electric as it gets.One of the things that sets Pulp Fiction apart is its nonchalant approach to violence. Tarantino doesn't hold back; he splatters the screen with gore like Marvin's brain. But here's the thing - it's so stylized, so over-the-top, that it's like watching a ballet of brutality. You're both horrified and mesmerized, much like a macabre magic trick - disturbing, yet strangely beautiful. You know it's not real, but it still shocks and awes you. Tarantino's signature style is on full display here, with witty conversations juxtaposed with sudden bursts of violence.And let's not forget the soundtrack. It's like the cherry on top of a deliciously twisted milkshake. Tarantino's knack for selecting the perfect song for each scene is as on point as The Wolf's method of cleaning. Whether it's the surf rock of Dick Dale or the soulful crooning of Al Green, each song is a carefully curated to create an unforgettable experience.Pulp Fiction is a cinematic adrenaline shot straight to the heart. It revels in the dark corners of human nature, finding beauty in the brutality of existence. It's a love letter to the pulp novels and B-movies of yesteryears, injected with a dose of dark humor and a finesse that's as masterful as the Ezekiel 25:17 monologue. As Tarantino himself might say, ""This is some serious gourmet cinema."""
29/09/2014,10,"Watching one of my all time favorite movies for its 30th anniversary, how do I begin to review? How about this: it's highly underrated as a comedy. Case in point: the opening scene with Sam Jackson (still robbed of an Oscar) and John Travolta. How does one not laugh at that?The entire movie is, of course, perfection. The writing is arguably the best ever in any movie ever made. Each of the three stories are gold, as is telling them in nonlinear fashion. An all star cast could not be done differently than those in the film.Pulp Fiction never ceases to amaze me with each viewing. Thank you, Q."
27/09/2014,10,"One of the toughest movies I've had to rate & review.
Firstly it does not represent the title ""PULP FICTION"" because real PULP does not involve Tarantino's tangents of food and his social frustrations. Real pulp is gritty, hard boiled, and most importantly believable, written by writers who don't try and survive on their own humor. The movie will never be bad and has a VERY attractive theme, compelling/interesting scenes and some organic, grade-A acting BUT you can feel when a filmmaker is flattering themselves for being unconventional. Tarantino loves to play the shock factor- Something that was fresh for the time (1994). It's a variety show that feeds the feeling of ""Bad but Cool"" and has become more transparent as time has gone forward. I can agree that it has STRONG replay value and all the means to be a classic but to be critically acclaimed and considered a landmark for film? Maybe not. Some parts feel immature as others bloom boldly. For most of the movie I wouldn't praise it for it's content only delivery, although- the exception being the last scenes textual brilliance- That much I'll admit. One of the great endings purely moved by text. That much I'll admit**"
19/09/2014,10,"I have no need to say anything else. It is action-packed, it has the best actors and the best director all in 1 place. Perfection on a screen! I watched itat least 10 times."
30/08/2014,7,Most plot twisting movie you'll ever watch. All these meaningless scenes come to a twisting great climax that'll blow your mind. Iconic performance by the legendary (Samuel L. Jackson) and (John Travolta).
27/08/2014,7,"A masterpiece of non-linear narrative film. Ingenious and meaningful structure, wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has beautiful qualities, but they are hopelessly moving towards darkness and confusion. Each paragraph does not have a beginning or end, complementary structure, and the beginning and end are connected, suggesting that the plots in similar films in reality always occur and never stop.
""Why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find someone truly special can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence."""
24/08/2014,7,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Everything. Harvey Keitel was fantastic as the cleaner. Brain guts all over the car! Oh my - that was just the bomb! How stupid but how funny! Loved the basement scene with Bruce Willis - bad-ass stuff - and that stuff does happen! Samuel L. Jackson was smooth, suave, quiet and cool....as I would imagine he is in real life. Sorry John - what did you do to your face? But you rocked the movie! Killed it, rocked it! And, the dance baby, oh, that dance - just yummy! Watch me do the Pulp Fiction Twist on Katydid Enigma on YouTube Baby....I can do it all Quentin....eat your heart out.....But it's all good,every movie Quentin makes is a masterpiece."
21/08/2014,6,"This is my first review, so don't judge too hard(Pretty much wrote it, only to complete my profile). I was 16 when this movie came out, and I remember how good every said it was. To be honest, after I saw it, I didn't understand what all the hype was about. Later I decided to give it another chance. This time It was a totally different experience, it was like it all came together. I have loved the movie ever since, and I must have seen over 10 times now. The acting is sublime. The story is awesome. The dialog is captivating. This movie sat Quentin Tarantino's name stone as one of, if not the best director of all times. Not only this one but pretty much all of his movies is a treat for the eyes and ears. It's A must see movie!"
19/08/2014,6,"""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.""The opening scene of this film is a film school classic. The dance scene with Travolta & Thurman is a film school classic.The entire film is film school required.What can I say?Perfect from start to end.Enjoy!"
19/08/2014,6,"I have to agree with those reviewers that find this film disjointed, overly and unnecessarily violent, and just plain difficult to understand. I, for one, fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of John Travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable. Focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences, Tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence, drug addiction, rape, and other assorted seedy topics. The plot (if you want to call it that) is non-existent and the scene involving Ving Rhaimes is just flat-out disgusting. For Tarrantino fans, this may be the ultimate. But for me, it's just not a good film."
18/08/2014,6,"Tarantino (and Avary) put these stories together and created Pulp Fiction, which is the movie that shocked the world in 1994. It is hilarious, and brilliant writing. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson deliver two hilarious performances. The soundtrack is killer, and the directing is slick. It is a very quotable movie, and very memorable. The only ""criticism"" is that like all Tarantino movies, it goes on for a little too long, so it does get a little muddled in the middle. Overall, this movie is a blast."
10/08/2014,6,"The only reason I'm reviewing this movie is because it's rated WAY more highly than it deserves. The movie is pretty crappy. It has a high rating for IMDB and there are great movies that have lower ratings on IMDB. The movie is a crime thriller and has great actors in it. And they are in far better movies than this. I don't know why this movie has been so successful with critics. The movie is a piece of the s word. It's up there with movies such as the Star Wars movies, The Godfather movies, and The Silence Of The Lambs as being some of the most over rated movies ever. The only Quentin Tarantino movie I loved was Django Unchained. That movie is amazingly good. The others from him I've seen range from awful to so so. Death Proof, by the way, makes Pulp Fiction look like a masterpiece."
31/07/2014,9,"... Let's clear one thing up first: I happen to believe that this movie is not as good as ""Reservoir Dogs"". ""RD"" had a clearly defined story and aim. I'm not so sure this does. It feels more like an exercise by Mr Tarantino, demonstrating just how audacious he can be. Is there anything wrong with such flashiness when the result is this entertaining? Not in the slightest.""The Gold Watch"" segment did nothing for me, and in my opinion should have been left out of the final cut, much as I like Christopher Walken. The rest of the movie without exception is a tour de force of controlled direction (Tarantino always knows where the film is going, even if his audience doesn't) understated but powerful acting, and moments of bizarre humour. I could quote the dialogue verbatim here, but there is simply too much quality and not enough space.This was also Sam Jackson's breakout role. For that we should be thankful, because the man is 'star quality' personified...No amount of superlatives can come close to encapsulating the feeling that most of you will get when watching the movie for the first time. It is an absorbing experience, almost like you have stepped into a much cooler VR sim of real life. Repeated viewings do not seem to dull its stark vitality.Those of you who abhor it for its casual attitude to violence miss out on its good points that DO NOT contain violence; namely, realistic yet captivating dialogue, flawless character development and bravura directing. It is much more than the glorification of gangsters and their subculture, a la ""Lock, Stock... "" and its ilk.Calling it the best movie ever made is hollow and unsubstantiated praise that I will not garner it with. One thing that can not be denied is that from its arrival it changed our perceptions of what cinema can mean to all people.Despite this, as I said, I don't think it can compare equally with ""Reservoir Dogs""..."
26/07/2014,9,"I love that line. Every time Samuel L. Jackson, or Jules, recites his line from he bible, I am sitting there like wow. This is powerful stuff. And then BANG. He shoots somebody. Lets get it straight. Quinten Tarantino is a genius. As the movie goes, the stories of 2 mobsters, a mobster's wife, a boxer and two ""restaurant"" robbers intertwine in absolutely the most perfect of ways. The two mobsters, played by Jackson and John Travolta, give two Oscar nominated performances in order to bring their characters to life. Uma Thurman, who plays Marsellus Wallace's wife. The scene where she is drugged out and Vega (travolta's character), has to drive adrenaline through her heart, I was sweating in my seat. SO INTENSE. Bruce Willis is also fantastic. Such a great movie, perhaps the greatest ensemble of acting in a movie. Not a best picture winner however. I only say that because Forrest Gump is the greatest film of all time. But that being said, Pulp Fiction wins in essentially any other year."
24/07/2014,9,"I have probably watched Pulp Fiction over 50 times. It is always so much fun to quote with friends and showing the movie to someone who has never seen it before is like giving them the gift of loving movies, which is what happened to me when I first saw it. The first reason for it's greatness is Quentin Tarintino, the director, who combines various techniques from multiple genres, mostly spaghetti westerns and french new wave, and puts his own unique twist on it. This makes for a completely original movie that includes all the great things from other classic movies. Another reason for the greatness of this movie is the acting. John Travolta gives a brilliant performance that many believe is the reason for jump-starting his career. also, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis. there are many other numerous things that make this movie great, including the music, small roles from Tim Roth and Christopher Walken, and 3 amazing stories that intertwine to create ultimate entertainment. I recommend this movie to everyone and hope that this helps you decide to pick it up and watch it."
14/07/2014,9,"There are times when you think about movies and picture the stereotype story structure. This is somewhat different, a well organised puzzle of a story, switching to different periods in time, that links and fits perfectly to create an epic movie brimming with stylish dialogue and interesting characters. The events That take place throughout the movie have it all, shocking scenes, tension, action, smart dialogue, well written stories, mesmerising conversation, romance and twists and turns. The whole package is topped off with a fantastic soundtrack full of great songs which compliment the picture perfectly. One of the unique things about tarantinos style is that the dialogue is so simple, about everyday things and occurrences, but you feel yourself so immersed in it, as the characters stylishly discuss things which bear no importance to the story, yet we find them so engrossing. This tactic has been used to build up tension, create an unpredictable atmosphere and create a real sense of sharp conversation. Pulp fiction is his best movie in my eyes, every scene and line of speech being near perfection."
07/07/2014,9,"Quentin Tarantino is a modern cinematic master, but he isn't a Hitchcock, a Spielberg, or a Nolan. Those directors, wonderful as they are, took the normalcies left behind by their filmmaking ancestors and spiced them up, making the familiar suddenly indelible. Tarantino, on the other hand, has never made something familiar to the viewer. His films, though often paying homage to the greatest of the grind house and the sturdiest of the studio system, twist anything even resembling an expectation — maybe the plots of Tarantino's films have been portrayed in some way or another before, but don't bet that the dialogue, the actors, the dynamics that fill each scene will match anything you've come to know.""Pulp Fiction"" is his most widely adored film, the one where his notable violent tendencies are kept to a comic minimum, the one where his dialogue never rings offensive and his exchanges glow with the smooth wittiness of yesterday's fools. Situations don't play out with the professional easiness of a square that went to film school: everything feels as though it were washed and dried by a cinematic nut more fond of staying home Friday nights watching Pam Grier kick ass than going out on the town with slightly drunken friends. Even watching a bad movie was better than experiencing the mundanities of life, because bad movies, bad as they were, took them away from the troublesome thing called reality.And so ""Pulp Fiction"" is a stew of cinematic wonders, some sexy, some funny, some tragic, some bloody — like the sordid comic books of the same name, there's unrelenting sleazy appeal to be found among the campy ruins. But the film is more than camp: it's radical noir, thunderously romanticized, delirious in its aesthetical violence. Tarantino doesn't just film his actors, his scenes: he falls in love with them, clinging on to their every move, making even the smallest of a detail, of a character, seem enormous in their connection to the overall buoyant picture. Tiny intricacies, such as the way John Travolta casually corrects Uma Thurman when she refers to all the waitresses at Jack Rabbit Slim's as Marilyn (one is Monroe, yes, but the others are actually schlockily dressed like Mamie Van Doren and Jayne Mansfield), says much about Tarantino's filmmaking personality. As much as he loves the icons and movies the general public refers to as masterpieces, he can't help himself from putting the underdogs on a pedestal and letting them shine, even if it's for a blink — because ""Pulp Fiction"" is directed by a cinephile who appreciates everything about cinema, not just the conventional Oscar nymphos. There's something about the film that still seems as dangerous as it did in 1994 — there has always been daring auteurs in the slippery slopes of Hollywood, but exciting is the way that Tarantino pushed, and continues to push, boundaries, making madness seem mainstream, luminous.Stories intertwine in a fashion reminiscent of 1956's ""The Killing"", time hopping yet staggering in its ability to complete each other's sentences. ""Pulp Fiction"" follows an assortment of characters, all connected: assassins Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson), powerful gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), his wife, the chic, cocaine addicted Mia (Uma Thurman), washed up boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), and bank robbers Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth). How they are associated I cannot say (it would ruin the genius of Tarantino's screenplay). But each character, so well drawn and so flawlessly portrayed (the actors are excellent, their characterizations already iconic in some shape or form), is unforgettable.Look at the way Vincent covers up his lack of smarts with his ability to go from agreeable to brutal in a matter of seconds; how Jules can enjoy the taste of a hamburger while ready to commit a hit because he's too damn used to killing; how Mia can make the mere smoking of a cigarette bolster the same sexy power of Ava Gardner or Louise Brooks; how Butch is willing to risk he and his girlfriend's (Maria de Medeiros) life for a watch passed (with disturbing fervor, I might add) on through generations; how Honey Bunny and Pumpkin don't think about the risks of robbing a restaurant because life is short and sin is fun.Even the most despicable of characters participate in conversation so complex and blackly hilarious we can hardly help but side with them. Tarantino doesn't just write characters; he lives vicariously through them, as if he kept them locked inside his mind until it became time to write the screenplay. Among the finest scripts ever written, startling is how confident every line is, how well the performers deliver each sentence. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a near perfect film, and though I prefer ""Kill Bill"", one can hardly deny the genius of Tarantino. How many directors create worlds as simultaneously grimy, cool, dangerous, humorous, appealing, as he does? If you can name five others, I'll have to take your word for it and revoke mine."
27/06/2014,9,"I rated this show a 2.  Why?  To me, this show was a senseless glorification of drugs and violence.  When seeing it in the theatre, my wife and I walked out and demanded our money back.  I've never seen the full movie...I couldn't stand it.  I've even rented it again, thinking I must have missed something...but turned it off 3/4 of the way through, thoroughly disgusted.Why was this movie rated so highly?  I think it is a sign of our times. Drugs are everywhere, and violence sells.  Rather pathetic, but true.  Says something about the decadence of our society.  Are we at the end of another Roman Empire?  Is it all downhill from here?"
19/06/2014,9,"This movie has everything, great actors, fun action and awesome dialogue. The only thing this movie is missing is a theme, which in my opinion adds to the fact that this movie rocked my world. You don't have to think too much about it, it may take you a few times to watch it to appreciate it though. The first time i watched this movie the only thing i was thinking when it was over was WHATTTT??? The second time i watched it it turned into my favorite movie. I really can't explain why i like the movie so much, it just sort of stuck with me. John Travolta and Sam Jackson are incredible, they show what hit men talk about when they aren't killing people. Uma Thurman is cheezy and perfect for her role as the hit men's boss's wife. Simply put this movie is incredible, but it may take you two viewings. Ten stars from me."
17/06/2014,9,"This is my favorite movie. What can I say, Tarrantino is a genius. I love that this movie has a lot of great actors so no single actor dominates the movie and the way the story is told makes this movie unique. Reservoir Dogs is also very good but I think this is Tarrantinos best film. (This movie is rated as the #19 best movie ever here on IMDB.)"
14/06/2014,9,"Pulp Fiction is the greatest movie of our time. Not only does it exceed by far the up to then set cliches, but it also sets such itself! A must for everyone, who thinks he knows something 'bout movies & for everyone, who thinks he might make a good director, when he grows up. Notice, that Pulp Fiction DID restore the fading shine of actors like Travolta & Bruce Willis, and DID make Samuel L. Jackson famous. A fine lesson about how to NOT urge the audience leave their seats in the midst of everything as some modern ""cult"" directors do."
09/06/2014,9,I enjoyed Pulp fiction and it have some great moments. I love the dance between john travolta and the boss's women. It was pretty great. Some bible passages and some good moments. I enjoyed it and we recognize pretty easily the way how Tarantino directed. Pretty nice movie.
19/05/2014,1,"The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy.
Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities.
""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""Pulp Fiction"" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it.
Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. No one is immune. No matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair Is a ""vulgar novel"", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies."
11/05/2014,1,"Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.This is the most overrated film of all time. I'm even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were ""OK"" movies but didn't deserve the huge credit they received.I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I'm not going to tell those of you that haven't seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Don't listen to anyone's opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then you're COOL!"
11/05/2014,1,"Well my first review just accidentally got deleted so here is for a second go of it.. Pulp Fiction has an excellent ability to interweave multiple dissimilar narratives into one cohesive story. It has a knack for balancing tense, dramatic moments with witty, comedic relief. Scenes such as the pawn shop basement with Zed, the hit men's clothing change after hiding a body with the Wolf, and Captain Koons' monologue showcase Tarantino's warped sense of humor."
07/05/2014,1,"From my opinion.. I watch the movie till the end and there's no nothing something special ""story"" ..alright it classic old movie was made 90s about crime ... but I don't find drama in the the movie ... however it wasn't too good and and it wasn't so bad."
20/04/2014,5,"As a 13 year old just getting into cinema, this was the best film ever. How could I not be blown away by all the clever dialog, great characters, fantastic storyline, and gripping violence. It was just pure heaven. I saw this movie three times in the course of one year, and I still have such fond memories of watching it. It was around the time I got serious about cinema (about two years later) that I felt I needed to give this another go. I'd discovered the works of Bergman, Tarkovsky, Godard,etc, and felt a connection with film in ways I hadn't before, and I wanted to see if the movies I loved before still held up. I had every intention of loving ""Pulp Fiction"" just as much as I did back then, but I didn't. There was nothing there, no core. All the things I'd loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that can't decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? It's violence that's harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend.It's a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in it's favor is that it's somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but that's not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like ""Andrei Rublev"" is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. ""Pulp Fiction"" is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego.Basically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. It's very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. It's so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But it's paper thin. This is exactly what I don't want in cinema"
01/04/2014,4,"Pulp Fiction is the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Reservior Dogs had released and was the talk of the town. Average movie that talks a lot and is set in mainly one place. Pulp Fiction is another movie that talks a lot, and doesn't do much else. It is a 2 in a half hour long movie and calls itself a action gangster movie. There is hardly any violence in this movie, its just talking talking and more talking. No where near comparable then Goodfellas, Scarface, Godfather or Casino. Only a few jokes like Bruce Willas and Ving Rhames in their worst nightmare. This is more of a comedy gangster related movie like Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. That was funny."
17/03/2014,1,"Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable."
16/03/2014,1,"After hearing so many great things about pulp fiction I was intrigued. A story consisting of a bunch of smaller stories that interweave is an interesting concept. And Quentin Tarantino absolutely doesn't fail to make it great.The story is driven by multiple but few characters characters that all serve their own purpose. Pulp fiction is filled with incredible action scenes while also keeping a realistic feel with personal conversations, regret, and emotions.With great performances by every single actor involved especially Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta who both do amazing jobs in keeping the movie realistic while also showing a lot of emotions.The movie is also incredibly filmed. With amazing angles and shooting scenes that make Pulp fiction a beautiful film with beautiful scenery, it's truly one of the best films from the 90s.I highly recommend you watch Pulp Fiction, it's a beautiful film with amazing acting and actors that all perform incredibly."
13/03/2014,1,"I submit this film is actually ( albeit crime ) actually a redefined renewed genre ! As in R D this narrative takes risks in its
style of of story telling which is virtually a Tarantino invention ! yes it is true of course, every director has his or her unique
style of moulding and honing their story , Tarantino aims his tails in a unique mix of his own well thought out concoctions .
I cannot think of any examples , but anyone who loves cinema will have seen some films that failed in their attempts to
copy Tarantino. Therefore, that statement , it seems to me , is clearly indicative that this director has always triumphed
over all attempts to either go one better than him or out fox Tarantino in the hope of overpowering his style of sculpting .
That is how uniquely brilliant Tarantino is, similar to Gaugin or Michael Angelo he is a true artist in his creations
As has already been said, to try and get some level of comprehension of this film , it needs to be seen a number of times.
The same appreciation and more clarity of understanding is precisely the reason we continue to learn more and acquire
more depth of real academic learning every time we return to the National Gallery in London or the equivalent American ,
Italian or French art galleries . Every viewing of the Mona Lisa we see something previously overlooked, or did not previously
fully understand ! The first page of training for a successful film director comes from his or her hours and hours of intimate study
of form, substance, and colour , of photography also. Kubrick began his career as a monochrome photo journalist , thereby learning
about framing and all the artistry that follows that ! Tarantino i suggest either had a natural eye and sensibility of form, or ( possibly and )
studied from a very early age, as much as he was able with regard to form, framing and colour hues ? And only at a slightly later time in his younger days started writing story lines and ideas ?"
10/03/2014,1,"I really like the way this film was orchestrated: from the way the story is told to different camera shots, you can tell a lot of time was put into making it. I watched this film as it is a cult movie (one everybody should watch) And it is arguably Tarantino's best film. The overall experience was great as you can really connect with the different characters and quickly get sucked into the movies plot. I recommend this to any aspiring movie nerd or Tarantino fan as it is very enjoyable.And you yourself will still be wondering... what was in that brief case?"
09/03/2014,1,"It resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genresI think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong."
17/12/2013,7,"I'm writing this purely for being able to cross it off my profile checklist that I haven't done in about 2 years. I'm pretty sure everyone as seen or at least heard that this one of the greatest movies of all time so I'm not going to get into all that. It sure is one of mine. All right, I tried to submit it but it wouldn't accept it without 10 lines so bear with me here. I really, really, really, really love this movie (yes that got me to the next line!) so I would definitely recommend it to anyone. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. Now. You won't be disappointed. Thanks for reading."
06/12/2013,8,"As John travolta is my favorite actor of all time . but in this movie his role have so much simplicity that any one can't live without watching such fantastic movie...I am giving 10/10 with no doubt ..because this movie cant expect not lower than this this I am expecting such good movie in future by john travoltaQuentin Tarantino , your direction is really good like your other movies Django Unchained ,Inglourious Basterds . but i watched your Reservoir Dogs after watching an Indian movie who remake form this move but that movie(Kanten) was worst remake in India .But that is obvious that most of the good movie of bollywood are remake of Hollywoodkeep it up john and Quentin"
03/12/2013,8,"What can i say, i saw this movie long time ago, it was quite something totally new and weird and fresh and dark and brutal, but i loved it from the first moment on. The soundtrack is a classic, which you can still listen today with a lot of fun, many lines from the movie people still remember and from time to time in the regular life situations they remember them. The Coolness of some characters is unbelievable, and 20 years later it has not lost anything of his brilliance. I mean the dialogs and the characters are just tarantinostyle, he's a league for his own. Even all his movies have something special, but pulp fiction is my favorite."
11/11/2013,10,"A brilliant look at honor among criminals in L.A.  It's the film that everyone has been waiting for, but took everyone by surprise.  If there ever was a film to watch, this is the one. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give head turning performances , and so does Uma Thurman. This film has a nostalgic feel to it.  It feels like this film was made sometime in the 1970's, but it was made in 1994. Note: I never understood why everyone that sees this film (except for me) says that it has nudity.  The people at Cinebooks need to get glasses."
03/11/2013,10,The movie brings out as one the best projects ever done by Quinton Tarantino and one of the best joined by its cast. It is extremely popular plus concept is all together phenomenal. Sam Jackson satisfies in his role and characters have nice writing.So is the movie overrated? Nah.
28/10/2013,10,"Pulp Fiction for me is the reason for watching films, it gives you everything you could ask for in one single film. The multiple intertwining story lines keep you engrossed throughout, each as individual and unpredictable as the next. The movie also produces some of the most stylish and memorable scenes and characters that you will ever see, with the wonderfully intriguing dialogue produced by Tarantino multiplied over by a cast that produced some of the most memorable performances ever. If there is such a thing as a must see film Pulp Fiction is it, Tarantino, Jackson, Willis, Keitel and Thurman all on top form not to mention a wonderful cameo by Cris Walken. Pulp Fiction is best film not to win a best film Oscar."
19/10/2013,10,"As a lover of oddities and strange things, this movie hit home. It's a cult classic, and wil forever keep that status, because it's unqiue and never gets old. The screenwriting is superb, and somewhat nonsensical, but that's what makes it great. There is no real moral, nothing besides 'enjoy the sho and enjoy it at surface value'.Films like this are memorable and rewatchable, and I would recommend it to individuals who have enjoyed nonsensical movies in the past.I am still wondering what is in the suitcase, and can understand Abed's obsession with it, and his obsession with this movie. Truly a masterpiece by Tarantino, making a non-linear film that could aily confuse the watcher, into serving that exact purpose yet still keeping it entertaining and out there."
18/10/2013,10,"This Movie is one of last century's biggest achievements. No exaggerating. To make a winning masterpiece, you have to be special. Is master Tarantino special? Tell me about it. People find themselves in Pulp Fiction and remain in awe of its stunning style, a work of art that wins in all areas. This is not my favorite movie ever, but I admit it's the most powerfully and creatively made among what I've seen.Not everybody will completely understand Pulp Fiction, Not that I claim I'm superior to many, no, the point is you have to know Tarantino to 1.enjoy and 2.figure out this movie quite well.The long and rich dialogue sequences, the unique close-ups, the usual tribute to the history of Cinema, the captivating violence and finally, the innovative style of the picture should be visible only to those who know the young phenomenon to an enough extent.The first time I saw it I was like, ""This must be great but I've not gotten the message"". The second time that happens to have happened a few minutes ago made me understand that THERE IS NO MESSAGE, a fact that per se was enough to convince me this one is a top-10 on my list.Tarantino is many young director-to-be's idol. He's got a gift, his works contain what many liked and seriously tried to insert in their films but couldn't. If Scorsese has one live rival to be able to compete with him, then it's none other than our man.Travolta and L.Jackson are in my opinion the best pair ever in the history of Cinema here and the supporting roles are acted to perfection. You can't imagine this movie without the presence of Thurman, Keitel or even cameos by the likes of Arquette and Z.Tarantino is a film lover/freak and you can sense it in each and every moment of his works, so make sure this title is the first one you'll watch after reading my review because I'm telling you, you'll love it."
12/10/2013,10,"Most of the time when I see a movie that has been so completely hyped beyond disbelief the movie turns out to be a disappointment, For Pulp Fiction, this definitely wasn't the case. From the very beginning I was captivated with the dialog and felt that I couldn't turn my head away because I had to see what was going to happen next. John Travolta and Sam Jackson give their best performances ever; watching them together is a real treat. The greatest part of this movie though is seeing how the movie rewinds and shows something going on in a different perspective. Everything in this film is brilliant and shouldn't be missed. One movie that actually lives up to the hype. Even if you've seen it once and didn't like it, watch it once more just to make sure.10/10"
09/10/2013,10,"I fired a person once because he told me that he loves criminal movies but answered ""No"", when I asked if he watched ""Pulp Fiction"".You can't miss it. This is a reference masterpiece."
08/10/2013,10,"Many say this movie is overrated, many hate this movie very much, and many walk out of cinema before it's even finished. But, like it or not, Pulp Fiction opens the door for other movies that contains one or more of its formulas to either be enjoyable, or have higher rating, or be looked cool, or even be popular. Those formulas are: (I cannot mention all of them)1) Short Stories Plots. Pulp Fiction is just like a book that contains short stories where each has their own plot. All the stories are connected one to another by the similarity of characters and incidents. There are stories of a couple who wanted to rob a restaurant, a gangster's wife and a hit-man's trip, two hit men's silly experience, and a runaway boxer hunted by gangster. They all happens around the gangster's environment. The time line of those stories doesn't have to be time wise, which means the story that happens first doesn't have to be the first to be told. Maybe Pulp Fiction is not the first movie, but later, many movie uses this kind of plot and become successful. There are Amores Perros, Babel, Antares, Sin City, Kill Bill, Intermission, The Dead Girl, Berbagi Suami, and many others with their own variation. Later, one of the variations called 'post-modern plot'. Maybe they don't have any intention to use the same formula or they doesn't even inspired by Pulp Fiction, for example, Chungking Express launched a little bit sooner than Pulp Fiction. But, it is Pulp Fiction who opens the door for them, it makes easier for others to be enjoyable.2)Many stories with different Point of View. In each of its stories, Pulp Fiction has a point of view of the third person (audience) that follows the main character. This kind of formula was already popular in the novel, long time before Pulp Fiction, Jeffrey Archer and even Sydney Sheldon wrote this kind of point of view. After Pulp Fiction, many popular movies use the same formula successfully, like The Hours, Crash, 21 grams, Syriana, Traffic, and many others including those're mentioned before. Again, Pulp Fiction just opens the door. 3)Satire to violence. Pulp Fiction is a satire to violence. Quentin Tarantino has always been making satire to violence movies, even sooner when he wrote True Romance a year before. He always makes violence look funny in a dark way, to some people who can enjoy it. After Pulp Fiction, there are movies like Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Cidade de Seus, Brick, Shawn of the Dead, Desperado, etc. 4)Independent Spirit. It is true that Stanley Kubrick has made indie movie long long time before Pulp Fiction. But, Independent Movies have never looked that cool before Pulp Fiction, and later, all the Kubrick's are looked even cooler than before.I love Pulp Fiction. Even it might not be my number 1 movie, but I have a great great respect and appreciation for it."
23/09/2013,10,"Three short stories that intersect in time, place, or character: the retrieval of the mob boss's briefcase of who-knows-what, the crony who must entertain the boss's wife for a night, and the flight of a two-timing match-fixing boxer. None of them end up how you expect.Tarantino's penchant for gritty, facetious dialogue reaches a new level here. It's what a lot of the movie is and it works wonderfully.Jackson and Travolta crush it. Travolta's character is endlessly amusing and Jackson's keeps you guessing what he's going to do.Tarantino inserts himself into his movie again. I wish he wouldn't, except maybe as an extra, because he isn't as good of an actor as anyone else he'd cast. But it's not a big deal.It's great. I can see it climbing for me. The only thing that holds it back is its disconnected nature."
09/09/2013,10,"Everybody has an issue with dysfunction. Dysfunction with family, in the workplace, in social circles or elsewhere in their lives, but everybody in today's society suffers from some type of dysfunction. This film illustrates the very meaning of dysfunction. In looking at any one of the characters from the John Travolta and Samuel Jackson roles as professional hit men (Vincent and Jules respectively) to the head mobster and his wife, Marcellus and Mia played by Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman, all were drowned in dysfunctional issues. The highpoint of the film is that in comparison to your own situation at home where you looked at the familial relationships as being the pinnacle of microcosmic sociopaths, this film makes them appear as angels. I believe one factor that helped make this film come together was the dialog. The wit of Jules was expounded brilliantly.In essence this film appears to have three separate and distinct story lines - which helps those of us with ADD. There is the component of mystery. For example it was never revealed what was in the briefcase Vincent and Jules were sent to retrieve.While I have actually viewed this movie on more than one occasion, I am not certain I can narrow one single plot or story line as the primary. The theme of the movie was the social implications in a dysfunctional world. While this is a very loose association, I would think that the horror movie (series) Saw is the closest thing I can offer in suggesting thematic comparison.His (Tarantino's) use of props and shock value are two of the most important components to tie into the movie's theme. If I had to pick a third, it would be the creative dialog between the characters.The film did not follow a strict chronological sequence which, in keeping with the dysfunctional theme managed to work in the film's favor.Tarantino uses his now well-known knack for the dramatic to create and develop roles that are violent, mysterious, humorous and charismatic all at the same time. Somehow this movie fits together. The direction, cinematography, and editing work to make a film with apparent random scenes somehow mesh.This particular film is indicative of the mind of Tarantino. Anyone who has developed a liking of his style and inner goings-on will appreciate this work. It is destined to be a classic in the minds of movie buffs everywhere."
04/09/2013,10,"Pulp (pulp) n. 1. A soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter. 2. A book containing lurid subject matter, and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and a finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."" - Jules' version of Ezekiel 25:17 Pulp Fiction is a piece of art and is one of the best movies ever made in films history. It's not my favorite film(To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite and that will never change)but it is my favorite Tarantino films by far.I finish this comment saying: ""This movie is one of the best movies ever made!"""
26/08/2013,7,"You must see this film simply because there's no other movie like it. It's Quentin Tarantino, red hot and constantly in motion, like the flames from the torches carried by the angry villagers in Frankenstein (1931). If you are new to Tarantino, and want to explore the style of this director/writer, Pulp Fiction is your starting gate.Tarantino was clearly running on 12 cylinders with Pulp Fiction, from start to finish, and by the end of the film, you'll suddenly feel as if your heart had stopped beating and you had inexplicably forgotten how to breathe. And for all of its visual intensity and pathos, the film explodes with some of the most witty and cutting dialogue since John Houston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). You could spend all afternoon discussing Pulp Fiction's myriad of memorable quotes.There are so many classic scenes in Pulp Fiction it would be a sacrilege to mention them here (although the ""hamburger scene"" stands out from everything else).This is one of Quentin Tarantino's finest hours, and the film, bold and shocking, remains peerless."
22/08/2013,6,"I love this film so much, i only really saw this film last year when i was 15, i was looking through my dads DVD collection and saw pulp fiction (the limited version) a few weeks before that i heard my ex boyfriend talking about it so i decided to watch it. I was in for a real shock seeing John travolta in it. I just used to think he was a bit of an all singing all dancing loser after watching 'Grease' when i was a little girl! But he kicked some ass in this film and as for samuel L jackson what a legend, this is now my all time favourite movie , i can watch it over and over and not get bored!.the only bit I'm not to keen on has to be the gimp scene! *cringes* i have to close my eyes at that part. any way great film"
21/08/2013,6,"Seriously, what is with all of the one star ratings on this film? What a disgrace. What the people HATED about this movie is exactly what makes it good. So many people complain there is no storyline. Bullshit. If you were actually paying attention to the film you would find that this picture was divided into different segments and switched around. Just because it's something different than what you're used to doesn't mean it's bad. It's called a ""non parallel plot."" Famous authors and filmmakers do this all the time, you just may have not noticed. Quentin Tarantino just takes it to another level because he has a very unique style where he likes to give you major cliffhangers and start the next substory, making you crave for more (an you do get it, just later on.) If anything, its a series of several stories, and the film is edited the way it is to show how these different stories intertwine. It's not that complicated of a concept, but the low intelligence of many viewers may result in complete confusion of what's going on.Flat characters? I really don't even need to get into this one. The characters all had their own distinct personalities AND YES, character development. If Jules' transition from crime in the beginning to wanting to get out of the business in the end isn't character development, then I don't know what is. There is an obvious misconception here of what character development actually is. And too much dialogue? That's Tarantino's style. What's with this sudden rule that a film should always be visually told and not told verbally? Bullshit. Art is something like a free for all. It works here. The dialogue is natural and is witty. I heard one reviewer say Tarantino is self indulgent here because his dialogue represents his thoughts too much. WTF? Just because he has a wordy script style means he's too self indulgent? He's simply writing a script with witty dialogue, there is no ego trip here. This claim is simply and utterly ridiculous. And if you're complaining about him being in his own movies, go ahead and say that Alfred Hitchcock was self indulgent and a bad filmmaker. I am very sure many people here wouldn't dare claim that.Overall, this is indeed one of the greatest films ever made. And that isn't because it's a fad film like many others say. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a film that has completely revolutionized the way film handles dialogue and the editing of a film's story. If people are unable to acknowledge that then they are only limiting their perception of what has made films evolve to what it is today. Films like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey,"" ""Psycho,"" ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"" etc., are all films with this kind of status. If you don't enjoy this film, then that is fine. However, to deny the importance or influence this film has graced upon the medium is simply foolish and unenlightened on the part of the viewer.This is simply one of the most entertaining films you will ever see in your life if you can keep up with the pace and the story. It may take a few viewings if you're the kind of person that can't understand this kind of plot, but I guarantee almost every time that if you watch this film over and over and study it like I have and numerous other classics, you will notice all of the big and little things that make this film what it is. It's truly a remarkable film. There may be little symbolism beside's Jules' commentary on the bible and reciting of biblical passages, but this film is more so about the entertainment than symbolic storytelling. There are two different kinds of films in that way, the ones that try to allude to something symbolic or important like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and there are other films that rely on entertaining the viewer like this film and ""Jaws."" I'm sure not many people will call ""Jaws"" a bad film either. Anyway, don't listen to the one star reviewers. They simply didn't understand the film, its story, or its style. This film is a real treat."
20/08/2013,6,"Tarantino's outstanding original screenplay contains everything that all create this pure masterpiece. The characters, culture, acting, cast ... with elements of comedy that make it more enjoyable than you could imagine. Pulp Fiction is perfection at its finest. One of the greatest films of all time without question."
15/08/2013,6,"For me, Pulp Fiction is a good movie. It's just not as good as so many say it is. When I took film classes in college, everyone wanted to be the next Quinton Tarantino. I actually thought Pulp Fiction had some brilliant scenes, but also some rather dull and boring scenes that were a struggle to get through. I've seen the movie now four or five times over the last twenty years to see if my opinion changes. It doesn't. In my opinion, it's a very overrated movie. It doesn't mean it's not a good movie. It's a must for any film buff, but the hype is a little over done."
12/08/2013,6,"Pulp Fiction is one of the most entertaining and darkly funny films of all time. Samuel L Jackson excels in his role as Jules Whinfield and Bruce Willis also sees a complete career recovery, how Pulp Fiction didn't take the oscars by storm is completely beyond me. All in all this film is a modern day classic."
11/08/2013,6,"Like I started, no flaws at all here, it's basically a masterpiece as with most of Quentins movies, of course all reviews are subjective to what the viewer thinks of the movie, of what he's seeing and here, well, I mean, take the watch scene for example, bringing out such things from a man like (well, we share a name at least) Christopher Walken, one of hollywoods alltime greatest plus one of the alltime greatest when it comes to people wanting to imitate his voice :) either way, I can't find a flaw within this oyster, it's a perfect pearl that deserves (imho) a higher up position, or at least not to be surpassed by people who never even managed to watch through it, its almost like with Stephen King's books that they filmatized, like IT or the stand, ran too long, so had to turn it into a 'tv' mini-series, thus dropping ratings a ton, cause it didnt air, however, nowadays, people who watch movies should be able to stumble on masterpieces like those, yet... do we ratings go up, no? No, they go down on certain movies and up on others, as in, more cgi and oddities... and less acting, sure, I aint saying that CGI does alot, but if you take the Christian Bale Terminator one, that was spoiled, however, the upncomers, be it in a different timeline etcetera... and sadly, actors do grow old, yup, however, Arnold as old, that was a stinger splash right there, hit the sweet spot, same goes for movies like Pitch Black series or the Jeepers Creepers ones.... Horror usually never finds its way into peoples heart, yet I saw one today that totally blew me away, can only hope that Quentin brings this man fourth into the light. (obviously talking about who directed it, etcetera) Since its kinda like the 'lighthouse' which is just insanely good also for being a suspensful, strange, surreal movie... just odd that Daniel Day Lews isnt in it, but then again, considering that Willem DaFoe did such a job, doubt they would've needed DDL. Not saying I'm not a fan, I am, same with this fine and very humour driven actor named Christoph Walz(t?) who's by far blown me and my fellow movie lovers away with his performances and from what i've gathered, using research and such, quentin was the man who found another nugget, heck, he could probably make anyone shine, just cause he's that darn good, plus i love that he loves old school cinema too, them robert rodriguez flicks he made, grindhouse, death proof etcetera, just shows how much he's evolving from golden oldies like this, insanely great movies.... and just cause its from 1994, dont let it fool ya, it will leave any youngun who thinks a movie has to have Michael Bay blowing stuff up for 9 hours non stop, gasping for air after watching a viewgasm like this. a Hundred pints raised from a Tiger born in the sign of Leo, ex-spetznas alfagruppe #1733 Batallion, greetings to imdb and much love to anyone who loves a good movie, cheers from Chris/Sweden."
11/08/2013,6,"First off it's a perfect movie well acted with a quotable script that just flow's so kinectly on the screen. Q.TS second movie is his best nothing since has matched the sheer brilliance of this film every character is memorable even if they are on screen for less than five minutes. Nothing in pop culture comes close to replecacting the quintessential brilliance of the tight script wonderfully acted film that just flows so well. Q.Ts most powerful directoring achievement is his second film. Not only does it launch stars but it gives life to failing stars revetlising failing acters and giving them a shot of life who would go on to command bigger salaries in bigger budget movies.
Unlike Quentin's latter movies that have much more bigger budgets and bloated runtimes the modest budget used on pulp fiction helps the director to sculpt a script and runtime to perfection within the limited budget. It's a masterpiece and lots of films have tried and failed to replicate the Quetin standard formula of his first two movies but failed terribly."
11/08/2013,6,"Pulp Fiction was released back in 1994, and now, nearly twenty years later (as of 2013), Tarantino's first real masterpiece can still be compared to some of the crime movies of today. Critically acclaimed across the world, we are presented with four interweaving stories about mob hit-men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a couple looking to rob a diner, and it deserves it's acclaim.Quentin Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, was a word of mouth success. Little was known about this raw, raunchy crime thriller from an unknown writer/director, but it became a cult classic quickly. Therefore, his follow-up film needed to be good, and he delivers.Anyway, on to Pulp Fiction. The Academy Award-Winning film contains four interweaving stories. They are gritty and foul-mouthed, but truly spectacular. Only few times have writer/directors been able to pull off such astounding films. Without dipping into spoilers, I can safely say that Pulp Fiction is like a dive of a cliff for first-time Tarantino viewers. You think it's risky attempting it, but when you do, you're hooked. It's this film that truly made Tarantino who he is today, and it's this film that can still stand the test of time, one of the rare few.Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece I can't wait to watch again. A truly spectacular film on all levels. A beautiful crime drama that accurately dips you into the crime world in ways we've never been dipped before, and I can't wait to get dipped again.10/10"
30/07/2013,9,"I have no idea where to start! This is my first post so I thought it appropriate to write about my favourite movie. First of all, the cast. The cast is what drew me to it in the first place, with Samuel L Jackson who is one of my favourite actors and Bruce Willis who is also in my top five, and I believe the biggest tragedy about this movie is that these two fantastic actors did not spend any time together on screen. Other greats (in my opinion) in this film are of course John Travolta and Uma Thurman. I have recently seen Swordfish in which travolta gave an incredibly strong performance as he does in Pulp Fiction, and Uma Thurman who I have admittedly not seen in anything else but also delivers a powerful performance. Leaving the cast aside, the storyline of course is pure genius. Another Tarantino classic with shooting, swearing, quoting from the bible, taking drugs, dancing and Samuel L Jackson shouting a lot, it has all the elements that make a great film."
15/07/2013,9,"What Tarantino can teach you about writing is that characters shouldn't just be pieces on a board to move the plot along, but they should be living, breathing citizens of the world the writer crafted for the viewers.That's why his films are so long, and pace so slowly: You sit with the characters. Hang out with them. Get to know them long enough so that they show you their quirks.On top of all this, Tarantino engages the viewer even further by writing multiple intersecting plot lines that are portrayed out of order, which is very satisfying as all the puzzle pieces come together.Knowing a little bit about a character's future can let the viewer breathe, and calling back to a familiar situation from a new angle is suspenseful to wonder WHEN or HOW that new element will play out.Overall a very refreshing, very wild movie. Truly a work of art. 10/10"
05/07/2013,9,The best A Brill film a classic. I dont think there could have been a better cast. Mr Jackson was so cool. I would'nt like to have p***ed him off. Tarentino's genius was excellent he got into everyones charchter better than any other director could ever. Just a Top Class film. One of my all time greats
30/06/2013,9,"People that I know call ""Pulp Fiction"" unique but one of the best movies ever made. I've only see two films by Quentin Tarantino, and they were both of the Kill Bills. I liked both movies as the ""popcorn loving"" action and dark comedy junkie that I am. So I expected something along that line for ""Pulp Fiction"". It is far from it.The best way I can describe this film is a non-chronological list of stories combined together with roller-coaster circumstances. Yes, there is some action. And yes, there is a lot of wicked humor. But what held my attention was the brilliant script by Quentin Tarantino (who won the Oscar for it in 1994). Even more so, the all-star cast flourished it with some stunning performances. John Travolta shed a whole new light on his acting ability as the cynical hit man, Vincent Vegas. Bruce Willis as the boxer, Butch is in a sense a protagonist, but also a man determined to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, even if it means killing. Uma Thurman is simply marvelous as the amusing drug addict Mia. Also included is: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, and Harvey Keitel are all nice additions to the film.Of all the performances, I found Samuel L. Jackson's to be the best. I always remember Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus in Die Hard 3, but as Jules in Pulp Fiction, he is larger than life. He's cool and funny, but also philosophical and the only character that changes his values towards the end of the film. He was snubbed at the Oscars. I was so captivated by the film that I did not even bother to realize that the movie was over two and a half hours. I can't help but say this is a great film. It is not my favorite, but I will agree that this should stay on the top ten at IMDb's top 250. 10/10"
15/06/2013,9,"pulp fiction is by far the best film to have ever hit this world... if you don't have it then i recommend that you GET it. Samuel L Jackson, Bruce Willis and John Travolta are by far the best actors and to have them all in the same movie just tops it off... if this ain't the best movie.. then what is? if this movie hasn't got the best cast.. then what has? AMAZING FILM, AMAZING CAST, AMAZING DIRECTOR.. what has this film not got? If you thought steven spielberg was the best then you were wrong, if you thought spielbergs movies were better then you were wrong - WHY? because Tarantino's got style and his reputation for his cool movies was built."
01/05/2013,1,"Good day, dear friends and dear readers of reviews! Today I want to write about one of my favorite and many times revised American crime thriller 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"". The director of this film is the incredible Quentin Tarantino. The duration of the picture is two and a half hours, they fly by as one minute. The cast is very strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis and a lot of other great actors that I love and respect. A bouquet that is necessary! I really like the work of Quentin Tarantino, his style is always very different from others, it is difficult to confuse with someone else. Perhaps this picture of all his most cool. The film has everything you need to have fun. Bright actors-stars, atmosphere, humor, dynamics, music and much, much more! This film is memorable from the first time, but you still want to review it. Everything is unrealistically cool, romantic, unusual and interesting. I look and take my breath away. I know all the dialogues by heart for a long time, they are simply incomparable! All the movements of the dance Uma and John have long learned and danced. Who hasn't tried to repeat them? In general, it is very difficult to find fault with something in this film. In my opinion, the picture is perfect! I don't see the point in retelling the plot, everyone knows it anyway. And if there are those who have not seen the picture yet, then I strongly recommend it to raise the mood and get pleasure. I hope that those who love this film very much, I just decided to remind you about it just in case. I wish you all a great mood and a lot of positive emotions. Thanks for your attention."
01/05/2013,1,"Perfect movie, I'm celebrating my 100th time watching Pulp Fiction, Best dialogue ever written and said on the screen, this movie inspired generations to do movies, I really love this movie, QT is a Master, all the acting was great."
11/04/2013,4,"This is as near to flawless as any movie I've ever seen. Everything is excellent, but it's the script that elevates this movie to masterpiece status. No other movie is as quotable as this.If you haven't seen this movie do yourself a favour and do so - today!"
07/03/2013,1,"I must be one of the few individuals on this planet that totally detested this film. I left the cinema feeling extremely ill. I went along to this film on the recommendation that it was highly amusing but I guess their idea of ""humour"" isn't quite the same as mine.Sure, it had some clever moments but why belabour the point."
28/12/2012,8,"If Pulp Fiction were meant to be a comedy I'd be tempted to give it 7/10 for sheer effort. It's got John Travolta in a wig (check out that ponytail!) Uma Thurman pretending to be a dancer, and Mr Quentin Tarantino himself in yet another cameo trying to prove he can act, and proving beyond all doubt that he can't.Amid the farce and supposedly knowing humour of this film there is one shining light. The performance of Samuel L Jackson as a hit-man stands out as one of the performances of the 1990s. It's a shame the director got his hit men mixed up and put Travolta at the heart of this film; with Jackson front and centre this could have been a first-rate crime drama, with the added intrigue of a man atoning for some truly wicked sins.Travolta is miscast as Vincent. He plays a hit-man who talks about hamburgers on the way to murdering his victims. Not because this is what hit men do, but because Tarantino is so desperate to be seen as cool his hit men simply MUST do something different.It gets worse. Vincent is assigned to look after his boss's wife and duly ends up on the dance floor. Quite why this is supposed to be so iconic I have absolutely no idea. John Travolta moves like a bored polar bear at times, and Uma Thurman may as well be on heavy medication for all the good she is. Rarely do you have sympathy for Hollywood superstars, but watching these two I did wonder whether the pair of them might consider early retirement. If nothing else, I guess this scene offers a cautionary warning to anyone fond of a hamburger; eat too many of 'em and you too could end up like John Travolta.Throw in Bruce Willis as a disillusioned boxer, Harvey Keitel as Wolf, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as a pair of hold-up artists, and, well, you've got a film not a million miles away from a Robert Altman picture of the Seventies. Or indeed a John Cassavetes film.This is my problem with Tarantino; you watch his films and wonder if you've seen it somewhere before. Reservoir Dogs was a deserved success - critically, at least - but with Pulp Fiction we've been here before many times.Its rating on this website suggests it is up there with The Godfather, and that, frankly, is the biggest laugh of the lot. Come to think of it, maybe I was right all along; maybe it IS a comedy after all."
08/11/2012,10,"If there are a lot of things in the 90's to recognize, one of them is Pulp Fiction. The Fantastic film by Quentin Tarantino that (next to Reservoir Dogs) is probably one of the most memorable titles ever released.The film begins a lot like Reservoir Dogs; For those who haven't seen that movie (As I have, but saw it after everyone else saw it)I will not spoil anything, but it begins like a Tarantino movie does, very weird and almost like it's in another world. It's reality, but in a very warped state of reality, where the world we live in is like the one we live in, but constant danger exists around every corner.The film then starts to the credits and leads the way into a series of events that tell you how the event we have just witnessed in the beginning started. It's kind of confusing to translate without giving away a lot, which is yet another reason to watch this movie.If there is anything I can give away, it's just about the stories, but anymore and this comment will need a spoiler warning.Story one follows Vincent and Jules (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), two men whose priorities are to retrieve something, and discussing the events of something Vincent is supposed to do with a character Marsellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife.The 2nd event involves a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis) whose life was changed by an event from his youth that follows up to the present time.The final event mentions some characters I cannot begin to mention because of the spoilers in that it will ruin the viewing experience to anyone who sees it.I'm gonna be honest, This is my first viewing of Pulp Fiction, and I've seen the countless parodies that have followed along with it. However, that shouldn't be a reason to not see it. Having seen the parodies, it still helps to see the movie, now 13 years old, to see what shocked a lot of viewers in the 90's. This film is violent. I'm not gonna deny that. This is a Tarantino movie, it's going to be violent, it's going to have language, and it is long and a bit confusing at times, but it is without a doubt, one of the single best movies ever made.No doubt, it's episodic cinema that is perfect to watch, and it's brilliant. You think Kill Bill and Sin City are good, WATCH THIS MOVIE. if you didn't think they were good, WATCH THIS MOVIE, it cannot be avoided. I rate it a 10 out of 10."
26/10/2012,10,"Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night."
21/10/2012,10,"I have seen Pulp Fiction 10 years after its release !! Of course , Thats because of the rating of IMDB .. IMDB is my # 1 resource of good movies based on the ratings in.. I would definitely go for the rating above 8 or above 7.5..While I would consider the movies below 7 .. !!Any ways , Back to the movie ..It was a very nice movie .. but I would just give it 7.5 out of 10 .. Good Cast .. It is worth watching .. !! ..."
05/10/2012,10,"With its nonlinear narrative, witty dialogue, and unforgettable characters, this crime masterpiece has solidified its place in cinematic history. In this review, we will explore the reasons why Pulp Fiction continues to be revered and loved by film enthusiasts around the world. One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its richly developed and memorable characters. From the cool and collected hitmen Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) to the enigmatic gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), each character is distinct and compelling. The stellar performances by the talented cast breathe life into these complex individuals, making them both relatable and fascinating. Pulp Fiction's non-linear storytelling technique is a masterstroke that sets it apart from conventional films. The interwoven narratives, consisting of various interconnected storylines, keep viewers engaged and constantly guessing. The clever use of flashbacks and unexpected twists adds to the film's allure, making it a thrilling and unpredictable experience from beginning to end. Tarantino's exceptional writing shines through in Pulp Fiction, elevating the film to new heights. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and often darkly humorous, making for some truly unforgettable exchanges. Memorable lines like Jules' iconic ""Ezekiel 25:17"" speech or Vincent's musings on European fast food contribute to the film's enduring legacy. The dialogue-driven scenes are a testament to Tarantino's storytelling prowess and demonstrate his ability to craft compelling narratives through words. Pulp Fiction effortlessly blends elements of crime, drama, dark comedy, and neo-noir, creating a unique and multifaceted viewing experience. The film's ability to seamlessly transition between intense and humorous moments is a testament to Tarantino's directorial finesse. Pulp Fiction's genre-bending approach pushes the boundaries of traditional storytelling, resulting in a film that defies categorization and appeals to a wide range of audiences. Pulp Fiction's impact on cinema cannot be overstated. It revitalized independent filmmaking and redefined the crime genre, inspiring countless filmmakers and influencing popular culture. Its innovative narrative structure and stylish execution paved the way for a new wave of filmmaking in the 1990s and beyond. Pulp Fiction's enduring legacy is a testament to its artistic merit and its ability to resonate with audiences across generations. In conclusion, Pulp Fiction is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences with its compelling characters, unconventional storytelling, brilliant writing, and genre-blending approach.

Pulp Fiction's cultural impact and enduring popularity are a testament to its brilliance, making it a must-watch for any film enthusiast."
23/08/2012,7,"A continuous stream of odd stories brilliantly sewn together, this is the kind of films that places itself in the back of your brain. When you first watch it, the overwhelming amount of episodes and the fast dialogue leaves you dizzy, knowing that you have just seen one of modern cinemas true masterpieces. Details from ""Pulp Fiction"" are still popping into my head, six years after I first saw it."
13/08/2012,6,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. My favorite parts are the characters of Sam Jackson and John Travolta Jules Winfield and Vincent Vega. Quentin Tarantino did a fantastic job. Other movies have tried to compare but none will. My good friend out in Los Angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of Jules and Vincent driving around town and having a discussion about Vincent's recent travels abroad. And the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. And I think that it's the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. Everything from the ""gold watch"" speech to Harvey Keitel's dialogue. Quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. He combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy."
28/07/2012,9,"Many Tarantino fans differ on what Tarantino's best film was. Reservoir Dogs? Pulp Fiction? Inglorious Basterds? Having seen all three, the opinion I submit is the majority opinion—Pulp Fiction. But why? Pulp Fiction, in my view, represents something few movies can pull off. A completely pointless narrative made into an astonishingly good film. What is so good about a movie with no point? It's actually rather simple. Pulp Fiction doesn't use extensive special effects, or mind-bending plot, or bizarre character development. Tarantino, in fact, wrote this one pretty much by-the-book, along with co-writer Roger Avary. The plot is nothing unusual or never-before-seen. But it's the careful eye of the artist, in front of and behind the camera, that makes this film such a treat.I have watched it six times already, and each time, the movie just gets better. Each time, I see something in the background that I didn't see before. I catch something someone says, or see some minor backdrop detail that I didn't pick up on. However, this isn't why I love Pulp Fiction so much. These details are not the main thing.It's the complete package. When you step back and look at Pulp Fiction as a whole, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Tarantino specifically chose 50 ASA film stock to make it look older than it was. This film created a beautiful look for a movie set in the sunny Hollywood Heights. The music was perfect for the crime thriller part of the feel of this movie, and the use of the Hawthorne Grill and the Chevy Nova were perfect selections to add to the classic feel of this movie, even though it's quite apparent that it's set in the modern day. Butch is driven to the hotel in a Checker cab, everything in general feels older than it really is.But what really sells it is the actors. Today, this wouldn't be a star-studded cast, it would be a diamond-studded, cast-on-platinum cast. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson make perfect hit men, and are crucial at the beginning of the film to setting up a surprising scene. Uma Thurman's small role is nevertheless appreciated, and she makes the most of her screen time not only on the part of the writers, but also because she has excellent delivery on her lines. At the end, though, I feel that Jackson is the star, even though there is truly no primary role here. His monologues are to die for in this movie.All in all, if you have not seen Pulp Fiction, change that."
27/05/2012,1,"Quentin Tarantino is a good director who has a knack for combining wildly imaginative music selections for his movies that seem to work so well you have to laugh with joy.He also is known for dark comedy, combining unexpected twists that dismay audience members to the point they often refer to him as a ""genius"".The problem with ""genius"" is that what is genius to some is mundane to others. Tarantino is also known for his plot twists. However the excessive focus on plot twists creates an expectation from the audience, which opposes the basic appeal: the element of surprise.In Pulp Fiction, twists are introduced with little finesse. Tarantino has improved with the years, but Pulp Fiction, an early film, becomes boring before it is over.Certainly worth watching, but early and raw compared to Tarantino's later films."
08/04/2012,6,"One of the greatest movies ever made, one that absolutely changed the landscape of modern cinema with its juxtaposed mini stories converging into one truly unforgettable masterpiece."
25/03/2012,1,"Try this experiment : Ask any tarhead or Pulp fiction fan one thing about this movie, and the first thing they will reply offhand is the incredible number of f words (271) found in this, and of that being the largest amount in any movie in history. So it may not seem unreasonable to conclude that this movie's incredible popularity stems from preteens and teenagers who think that the f word is cool and hip. Doesn't paint moviegoers in the best light does it? While I liked Reservoir dogs and Kill Bill 1 and 2, I simply cannot understand how this movie was voted into the top 10 or maintains such a huge fanbase? Dogs and Kill Bill were both groundbreaking and Tarantino flicks themselves may be a kind of acquired taste but there is enough offensive material in this movie, totally wanton, to put anyone off. Overall it is nothing special and outstanding.Now since some of his other movies were really good, Tarantino must have obviously done something right in Pulp fiction. So what could have possibly been that makes this movie so popular? Realism - Like all his other movies, this movie is very realistic. But there aren't enough outstanding scenes where realism adds an extra touch. There are only scenes of violence, extreme and explicit drug abuse, sodomy and boring conversation. The open use of racism can be considered realism but it is simply so easy to implement if one wants to.Dialog - Mostly long and highly trivial. French McDonalds, killing people, coffee...wtf? You can only make something great out of it only if you overanalyse the dialog and then put your self in a delusion of being a great analyst or philosopher. Too many f words, n words and racist lines. This is not cool, kids. Its garbage. Or I guess that a lot of people converse on trivial lines and it is uplifting for them to see the same type of boring talk in a big movie? Acting - Pretty good but once again, there are too often uttering long and trivial dialog. None of the characters are likable or even dispiseable to the extent that they have such depth. They were all pretty shallow.Plot - Mostly nonexistent. You could probably extract a story of redemption from it but too many people put all sorts of philosophical angles which were simply not intended. A bunch of different chapters intersect at one point. Harvey Kietel's character is pointless and is just thrown in as a deus ex machina. Tarantino's character and dialog are also pointless.Actions scenes, special effects, twists and all that - None. Most scenes are well done but they simply boring. A simple scene well done but nothing special happening in it.One teenager probably goes and tells another teenager how cool this movie is for nothing other than its explicit use of offensive elements (drugs, violence, sodomy, bad language) and he tells his friend and so on, the chain reaction makes less than mature minds fall for this movie. When someone speaks out against how bad this movie really is, they are labelled as idiots so are afraid to speak their mind. I'm glad that 225 reviews here were at least accurate. Screw the peer pressure and speak your mind, kids.Sorry, this anti-movie just leaves more of a negative impression than any positive. It also drags too much. Its quite revolting although some scenes are quite memorable."
14/03/2012,1,"This movie without a doubt has never had a dull moment, there is always something bizarre or interesting happening around every corner. The cinematography is a masterpiece. Tarantino's style makes the audience feel like they're in the movie by the camera movements, and the way the story is told, is also one out of the many unique things about the film. The first time I've seen it, I was so confused on how the story was basically out of order but the more times I watched it, the more I caught onto Tarantino's style and the more I appreciated it. This movie was ahead of its time, and in my opinion considered a masterpiece."
01/03/2012,1,"Let me however extrapolate, embedded in a Pulp Fiction review which I couldn't care less for - on my film review style - from someone who has a media degree in film studies, and began their career wagging school at fourteen to watch French Cinema; and you know what they say about people who have experiences at an impressionable age - it sticks! I gave up on Hollywood in approximately the early seventies after Easy Rider and Zabriskie Point. I even walked out on Five Easy Pieces, even though in retrospect, that wasn't the film's fault, in those days we were keen on life and not on introspection and reflection. Though retrospection, tells me that was a good film. In fact it is the kind of film that the baby boomers now crave, good writing, and good characterisation from a period in history when just being alive was an entertainment, and not bogged down with crazy little computer screens and cowards with their wise-arse messages tweeted because they are too afraid to speak, possibly because even the modulation of the voice has been colonised by trendoids, who are so post-modern and wise-arsed they know everything; but at the head of the pack are a bunch of no-talents who have clamoured to the high ground. And that list is endless in entertainment, now: Quentin Tarantino (highlight-dialogue in Pulp Fiction, ""In Holland, they have mayonnaise on their fries."" - conclusion - lame) Johnny Depp (the guy can't act, get it? That's why Australians get Oscars now, as Hollywood is beyond knowing, who can act]; Russell Crowe (just because Hollywood couldn't get anyone else to fill out a Roman general's tunic except maybe some wooden ex-wrestlers), he wins the Oscar-but in his next movie, A Beautiful Mind, everyone gets an Oscar except him, because basically, when you play a screw-loose professor, exchanging walking around in circles for walking around in squares, it is not acting! It is a guy walking around in squares cos he worked out that was a riff on walking around in circles]; Saving Private Ryan, though I hate to admit it is a brilliant film - through its depiction of my grandfather's generation, who when I was growing thought wasn't cool; but mine who made every piece of furniture in their house to a French polished standard; as well as, the P. A. system for my Uncle's successful band including the foldback cabinets-which even The Beatles didn't have-as well as keeping a 200 acre dairy farm as a hobby. Cool, I don't think I knew the meaning of the word; but the Juden angle in Saving Private Ryan which is shoved towards the POWs by a man brandishing - a Star of David (on his dog-tags?)-as the POWs march past-I'm not buying because usually and in that war in particular - it is the politicians, the military hierarchy and their bureaucratic underlings who systematically entrench racism as a tool of their propaganda and the common soldier is generally ideologically neuter as they have to follow orders or get shot - otherwise on the western front in 1915 both sides would have turned around and marched home. But that was the only glaring error in my opinion but this ethno-stereotyping, though understandable has spilled into other films, especially the Star Wars epics, by George Lucas, wherein Cowboys and Indians in Outer Space in the early films becomes metaphoric American foreign policy in latter films... to be continued..."
17/02/2012,8,"Quentin Tarantino had an immediate fan base following his career after the release of the excellent ""Reservoir Dogs"" in 1992, which only grew significantly upon the release of the much-revered ""Pulp Fiction"" two years later. Commonly referred to by many as one of the best films of the '90s, the film was simply a revolution, its impact undeniable. Many - perhaps the majority excepting those who prefer ""Jackie Brown"" - consider ""Fiction"" Tarantino's finest work. Countless film fans worship at its alter. Am I one of them? Not really. I think the film is fantastic for reasons I'll soon explain, but I don't passionately subscribe to it as Tarantino's best either. In fact, ""Django Unchained"" is easily better, and this film has serious claims to that title from ""Inglourious Basterds"" or ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" (YES, I think it's better than number one, okay...easily better, in fact).But why is this film so particularly popular? It's remarkably clever, pop-culture-hip, reference-heavy dialogue is one such reason. There's no wonder it won Tarantino and Roger Avary an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The technique on display only matches the words - Tarantino's patient, passionate direction and Andrzej Sekuła's stylish yet unobtrusive are a match made in heaven.The film is consistently tense, electrifying and unpredictable, and that is aided by its (at the time at least) unique non-linear narrative. It never complies with Hollywood movie clichés, and even in 2016 this approach is refreshing.Fans and viewers which of ""Fiction""'s distinctive four chapters is its best. Some, like me, will place the first chapter (somewhat smug and self-satisfied, like Uma Thurman's performance on re-watches) and the last (overly convenient - how come nobody walks into a previously packed diner and interrupts the goings-on?) the worst of the best. They'll prefer the brutally tense mid-section involving the sexy anti-hero Butch Coolidge (perhaps a career-best Bruce Willis) and the darkly hilarious, clever Harvey Keitel-assisted murder clean-up. They are certainly the film's highlights for me. But the film encourages subjectivity (the suitcase, hello?) and perhaps these different interpretations are part of the fun of this wickedly clever, irrefutably influential modern classic."
13/02/2012,8,"Tarantino wrote a screenplay with Roger Avary for one of the greatest films of all time. Amazing shots but an even greater cast brought together by Ronnie Yeskel and Gary M. Zuckerbrod. Each performer brought emotion, hilarity, and a sense of realism to the scenes. One specifically, Uma Thurman's scene as Mia going through an OD, the seriousness within the scene on each character's face and the stillness of Thurman's person and aftershock was scary real. Viewing this from two different age groups (my younger brother saw it with me) we saw the characters had depth and the cast altogether was hand picked to perfection. It's no wonder the box office first weekend alone had brought more than triple the budget! Would greatly recommend to anyone!"
05/02/2012,8,"This film is somehow able to tell the stories of many different people, yet be cohesive and interconnected without making it obvious. Few movies are able to tell the story of one person successfully, but this film is able to tell multiple.The storytelling is exciting, suspenseful, and in some aspects quite deep. It will make you feel happy, fearful, and surprised.I've been putting off watching this movie for a long time and am glad I finally took the time."
24/01/2012,8,This is the best movie I have ever seen. I first saw this movie when I was 11. And from that point on I wanted to be a movie maker. Mr. Tarantino is a god among mortals. His vision is so beyond words. A lot of people say this movie is overrated. I say you are stupid if for one second you think this film is garbage. I love every aspect of this movie from beginning to end. I like how Tarantino used a non linear plot line. It just fits the mold so good. When I was 11 I herd a little about pulp fiction some said it was a good movie. I saw it and was in shock in how amazing it was. I just want to say if you are looking for a great movie in every aspect see this movie that god had blessed himself.
20/01/2012,8,"Even after watching it a hundred times, it's an enjoyable ride.
We are thrown in a few different stories which are interconnected. We meet a couple of hitman, their boss and his wife, two robbers and a boxer that's over his prime.
The dialogues and monologues consume quite a bit of the time, but they are so great that we end up craving for more. They give you a pretty good idea of who the characters are and what they stand for. It's something we've come to expect from every Tarantino movie, but it was done especially well in this one.
The star filled cast is just unbelievable. It's amazing how they all leave their distinct mark in the story.
All in all, in Pulp Fiction, we get Tarantino at his best: bloody, dirty, funny and simply awesome."
15/01/2012,8,"For some goddarnit reason I waited 26 years of my life to watch this masterpiece. It has everything I love
* Gangsters/hitmen Vince and jules, stoical in violence and ready for a good punchline.* Something I call checkov's waterpistol: in this case, characters you initially think are going to play a major role but then do not
* There's not a big story. Its just slice of life of a hitman, including some side stories for ""lore"" reasons
* A good ending for those that deserve it.Including to that nods to other masterpieces and you're left off with pulp fiction. Finally I see why they call this Tarantinos masterpiece!"
04/01/2012,9,"I think Pulp Fiction was a terrible movie....but the story is downright incredible.  The lives of Jules, Vincent, Marcellus, Mia, Butch, Wolf, all wrap up together so well, you'd think the story was based on an award winning novel.  Quentin Tarantino is probably the most creative writer/director in Hollywood.  And I love the story and the acting of Pulp Fiction, but still, this was a horrible movie."
24/11/2011,10,"This film, without doubt must be the coolest film ever. It has so much class, it has so much style, you could only wish you were as cool as some of the characters in it. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield(Samual l. Jackson) are two of the coolest characters to ever appear in a film and are played by probably THE most talented and cool actors on the planet.This is Tarantino's best film, and Tarantino's films have nothing but style. They have classic one liners and amazing soundtracks and i've already mentioned the characters and actors. If you have ever seen Reservior Dogs or Jackie Brown you would know what i mean but if you haven't i would strongly suggest to go buy them, forget renting as soon as you see them you would be amazed.Pulp Fiction is a must see and you would understand when i say it's the best film ever if you've seen it.Watch it and enjoy!"
19/08/2011,6,"This film is one of the greatest ever with awesome direction and superb writing, particularly the scenes involving John travolta and uma. Introducing a style which has been replicated countless times (snatch, bad times at el Royale)"
04/08/2011,7,"Even though it was made in the 1990s, this film became an instant ""cult classic"" right off the bat. Director Tarantino did a great job with this film, having all the right actors and doing a fantastic job with the film work of the film. Ever hear somebody quoting a movie, generally it is something from this one. Fans of the film can go quote after quote of this film and hearing it from them just makes you want to see it more. With the story and his style of directing, this movie did a very good job at portraying the art of contemporary films."
03/07/2011,9,"The soundtrack of ""Pulp Fiction"" is a crucial element of its identity, featuring an eclectic mix of surf rock, soul, and pop. Tarantino's selection of music not only complements the film's tone but also enhances its narrative. Tracks such as Dick Dale's ""Misirlou"" and Dusty Springfield's ""Son of a Preacher Man"" are not just background music but integral parts of the film's atmosphere and storytelling. The songs used in the film give it a timeless quality, a sense that events on screen are happening in an alternate reality. The action seemed to be set in the present day, but the characters remain blissfully unaware of the period's dominant forms of music: grunge, hip-hop and electronica."
24/06/2011,9,"Pulp Fiction is considered one of the true Tarantino classics, if not THE classic. It is a gangster movie that presents several incidents over a specific period of time, not necessarily chronologically, all in connection with each other in some way.PF is a different kind of film; it contains many genres such as action, drama, comedy, crime etc. and it also contains many different themes. It is hard to put this film in a specific category and consider this film to be a specific type of film; it is what it is - something unique, something original. Pulp Fiction is the perfect name for this creature of a film, because it is nothing and it is everything. It has no message or true story that it is about. This film is what ever you want it to be! This film has given me the precise description of what being cool is! The character Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the absolute coolest character of all time, if you ask me (I dare to claim that others will agree with me deeply). If you have not yet seen this magnificent piece of art, this you must do as soon as you get of work/school/whatever you're busy with right now. This film is filled with great speech lines, perfect violence scenes, the definition of coolness, perfectly selected background music, perfect actors and I could go on, I swear.Although this film does not tend to tell or show anything, it gives you a lot of good sequences and pleasures both your eyes and ears while doing so. Although I love this film as my all time favorite, I understand why some people don't understand the greatness of this film. Many people can't cope with the fact that it does not seem like your typical gangster/action film and therefore they find it peculiar, maybe even absurd.I sure hope that you will enjoy this film for what it is (as I did, do and will keep on doing); a perfect film experience in its own genre that contains everything you need on screen in a 154 min interval. Everything in its own unique and extremely simple way. This is more than a movie. Hope you'll enjoy! 10/10"
18/05/2011,1,The movie came off as funny and serious at the same time. Great performance by the actors and the directors. I love how the story unfolds and the jumps in time
26/02/2011,8,"Three renowned actors and my favorite director, Quentin Tarantino go on create a movie masterpiece. The amazing actor, Samuel Jackson plays an astounding character who is the king of cool. In addition, John Travolta is a gangster who is up for any job. Moreover, John McCain plays a boxer who doesn't take the fall. Not to mention the rest of the cast who each give a memorable moment throughout Pulp Fiction. There's no dull moments in Tarantino's finest work. The story takes the viewer on ride through drug, deception, murder, and everywhere in between. I'm a little bias towards Jackson and Tarantino, but for any movie lover this is a must watch."
16/02/2011,8,"Royale with cheese anyone? Every part of this Tarantino film is beautifully done. Even when you are just watching a scene that involves two characters talking to each other, the writing and the acting is done so well you find yourself wondering why other films aren't like this. The killer soundtrack that is perfectly paired with each scene keeps you locked in throughout. The perfectly timed flashbacks, use of chapters, and the skill of merging multiple storylines into one shows the talent of Tarantino. I can watch this movie 100 times in a row and find something new to appreciate every time, it's just that enjoyable and well made."
09/01/2011,9,"Pointless, violent drivel.  I have heard this called the best movie of the 90's... sad sad commentary about the state of movies in the 90's.  Pure crap.  If you want to see a similar movie with at least some redemption watch the Usual Suspects, at least it had a point."
07/01/2011,9,"The one thing that really makes this movie stand apart from all other movies is not the gratuitous violence, nor the philosophical issues it raises, not even the dialog. We've seen all that before in one movie or another, though perhaps not as powerfully combined as in this movie. The one thing that REALLY makes this movie stand is how much fun it is to watch it. EVERY SECOND of the movie is incredibly entertaining. Every of the several story lines is captivating, novel, unusual, and, quite simply, interesting. How can I ever watch conventional blockbusters after this movie?Some of the great precious things for me in this movie: the watch-in-rectum story, a disgruntled suburban asking his good old friend Jules who has just brought a dead body into his garage whether there was a ""dead n***er storage"" sign in front of his garage, the foot massage discussion, the thought of what will happen to Zed, Wolf's knack for solving every possible problem, the Quarter Pounder discussion (by the way, its true; you CAN buy beer in movie theaters AND in Mc Donalds in Europe) and of course the initial shootout. Watching the soon-to-be-dead guy tremble in fear as Jules skillfully leads the discussion (""breaking his concentration"" at times) is so much fun. There is a lot to be said also about the style of the movie. The dialog is of course legendary, and every line in the movie is infused with significance. While all characters really do seem like they are out of a comic book they all exude style. This makes their every action, as I said before, fascinating.The movie is quite violent. Even though the violence is stylized, it is depicted with scary realism and its full consequences, unlike action movie violence. When a guy's head gets blown off, we see it in all its glory, including our main heroes trying to ""pick up the pieces"" for the next hour or so. This is perhaps also one of the few movies that had the audacity to show a male-on-male rape and afterward the victim, having gotten the upper hand over the assailants, seething in anger and desire to extract unimaginable revenge, despite his calmness. Unlike in action movies, everyone is scared ****less when their lives are at stake, even though a sharp line is still drawn between the main characters of the movie and ""cannon-fodder"". This is also one of the few movies the ""n"" word is used so often, most of the times with just the right energy to have a hilarious effect. Quentin, in my opinion, rightly says in an interview that every time a word is given such a power, one should shout it out from the rooftops until the power goes away. Anyway, here's to Quentin remaining a prolific director for a long time in the future!By the way, if he ever decides to make a Big Kahuna franchise, he would be a millionaire. Those burgers looked real tasty!Rating 10/10Scale: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE"
09/12/2010,8,"It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly.  Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object.  The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two."
28/11/2010,10,"As for RESERVOIR DOGS, for PULP FICTION too there will be a before and an after. The movie industry was not the same before and after. After both of those films, there were dozens, hundreds, thousands of crime dramas inspired by those two masterpieces from outer space. More or less copycats offering so many elements inspired, picked up, stolen, from RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION. Less from JACKY BROWN and KILL BILL though. I speak here of dialogues, editing, story structure, camera work, characters, all kinds of situations inspired from the great, unique Quentin Tarantino, who brought to the movie culture, science, the equivalent of what George Melies, Mack Sennet, Lumière Brothers did in their times. Quentin Tarantino who re invented the cinema material. The pioneer of the modern film history. In PULP FICTION, Q T makes something different from his previous marvel RESERVOIR DOGS, this is not a copy despite some elements in common, all as ingenious and daring as RESERVOIR, for instance dialogues totally weird, funny, exciting, riveting, quirky at the most. And I don't speak of sudden violence, dazzling brutality. This is precisely the kind of point which I mean when I speak of what kind of things the other directors are inspired from Tarantino's cinema. PULP FICTION is for me the best of the master, but the other films are great too, don't misunderstand me."
15/11/2010,10,"Pulp Fiction is without a doubt Quentin Tarantino's best work. The film is a long, violent parody of the gangster genre with some excellent performances. The dialog is very profane with countless F- words. It also sounds very geeky at times. However, its razor-sharp, slyly self-aware and frequently very funny. There are multiple story lines which intersect, and the screenplay won a richly deserved Oscar. Samuel L. Jackson is in tremendous form and has a memorable speech. Travolta, Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman are all good. The film remains engrossing throughout and is highly recommended.Overall 10/10"
13/11/2010,10,"No, this film did not repulse me as much as reservoir dogs did. That's among the best things I can say about this movie. The fact that so many people seem to love it so much is actually frightening to me. I just can't seem to understand the desire to see this director's shock value material. What is the fascination with seeing ears cut off or needles jammed into people? I sat through it and must admit there were some positive things worthy of note. I did laugh at some scenes and John Travolta's performance was his only good one since the 70s. My 3 pts out of 10 are for: 1)Samuel Jackson with the hamburger 2)the absolutely ridiculous story by Christopher Walken and 3) the absurdity of Keitel coming in to clean up the mess. All in all, excrutiating, but as I say a step up from the first film by Tarantino."
01/09/2010,10,"Now I may be condemned for hating this movie, but I'm sorry, how much can we possibly glamorize drugs and smoking with no plot and bad directing. I turned it off halfway through it was so pointless. It's too bad these fine actors were thrown in this MTV-GenerationX-drugs-are-cool scenario. If you want to see a great modern flick, rent ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""Reservoir Dogs""."
26/08/2010,7,"I ended up watching the film this year, and its now one of my favorites of all time. John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson play their characters phenomenally, and they work really well together. Also there's so many memorable lines in the film. Director Quentin Tarantino adds to the list of great movies by executing another spectacular film. This movie is a real one of a kind type of film, well I believe at least. Uma Thurman does a stunning job, she brought an entire new aspect to her character, her character seems very independent and is quite likable. I have personally recommended this film to a variety of different people, and I believe it can be enjoyed by film lovers of any genre."
20/08/2010,6,"What ""Pulp Fiction"" does is not give you the normal, rinky-dink, Point-A to Point-B, generic movie. The film isn't about plot progression. What Tarantino does, in essence, is create an entire world. This is a vast, interwoven, interacting, multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid, solid characters. What this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character, but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world, into another life, and accept this ""morally ambiguous"" modern-day epic. Truly, there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer. And, lastly, on a personal level, while I do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history, it is personally my favorite film, and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry. So obviously, it must have something going for it."
12/07/2010,9,"It all began with RESERVOIR DOGS. An unbelievebly real movie that got a new name in the minds of all movie lovers acrossed the world: QUENTIN TARANTINO. PULP FICTION continues what Reservoir Dogs started, and proves that Quentin is indeed one of the best and most original directors ever. Who else could write three attractive totally different stories, and get them together into a thrilling 3 hour movie that will not even allow you to breathe? And probably the best part about the movie is the dialogue: fast, ingenious, exciting. Perfect. Two guys, John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson, almost screw up a job they have to take care of. A boxer, Bruce Willis, just before a fight in which he's asked to lose. Two thieves, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, deciding to rob a restaurant. Take these three stories, put them together in a bowl, and shake as much as you can. Result: a brilliant film. A big-size puzzle that will make you think. I know that it's one of the most known movies in the world. But if by any chance you have done the stupid thing of not seing it, then hurry up. Cause Quentin's not wasting time: new masterpieces are coming up soon.Vote: 10 (out of 10"
08/07/2010,9,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a Quentin Tarantino-directed film about a series of stories, involving two gangsters, a boxer, and a gangster's wife, and how their stories inter-mangle with each other. This is by far Tarantino's masterpiece. Now, I've heard rumors that his next film, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is suppose to be his masterpiece, but I don't know. I would say ""Pulp Fiction"" is his masterpiece. The writing is magnificent. I found myself laughing tremendously from the dialog, which is great because I enjoy clever writing. The acting was magnificent. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman were awesome in the movie. Everybody else was awesome as well. But you have to see it for yourself because I can't describe its awesomeness here. However, I have to say this: The n-word is used excessively in this movie, so if you're offended by the use of this word, then this isn't the movie for you. If not, then you shouldn't mind."
16/05/2010,1,This is my second favourite movie of all time..as y'all know how good Q Tarantino when it comes to filmmaking and as my opinion this is a perfect Tarantino movie🍿So Y'all better watch this 😉
11/05/2010,1,"For me this is the best Quentin Tarantino's film ever. Blood ,madness and music make this film a masterpiece. Even some scenes are took from another older movies but still you feel this scenes and enjoy it. In fact this movie makes a new line in the cinema which is a collection between gangster's movies and dark comedy .It's different in his style and we can see this through it's intro and it's chapters that make you confused but still enjoying the film. No wonder that this film nominate for 7 Oscars and won one of them which is best original screenplay for Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino . If any one doesn't watch this movie yet. I recommend this movie to watch now ."
29/04/2010,5,"As usual Tarantino shows us again and again, what a good writing could achieve in a movie. With countless of seamless dialogues that flows like a river. And story arcs that intertwined with each other, the audience will be swept away in a heartbeat by just listening to those writings. Even a blind man can watch Pulp Fiction."
19/04/2010,5,"I love the screenplay of this film.  Some people say that All About Eve is the greatest screenplay ever, I beg to differ.  Q takes us on a roller coaster ride with his words.  After the film has ended you'll find your self going back, just to try and memorize the amazing one liners.  His characters are extremely likable despite there flaws, and there are some moments in the film that will stay with you forever!A testament to great writing and other movies had tried to copy the style of Q's film..........some have succeeded, but most have failed because there is only one PULP!"
13/04/2010,4,"I've seen Pulp Fiction many times and i love it more and more every time i watch it. The content of the film is truly unique for its time. The plot has dimension which makes you notice something new every time. Characters are wonderfully developed and are believable. There's plenty of drama, a good amount of action, and a few laughs that lighten the mood of the film. the script is well written, dialog among the actors is amazingly natural and realistic. the story is not hard to follow unlike some films similar to this one, and offers an interesting presentation considering scenes are not in the standard chronological order. I would recommend this movie to anyone viewing this page unless drug use and violence offends you. Pulp fiction is a must see for action movie lovers, and great movie to enjoy on an evening in."
11/04/2010,4,"It took me next to twenty years to review this film appropriately; i should say, it took me the best part of ten years to realise that not everyone might see it my way. Under close scrutiny, the world of cinema goes this way, more or less: Kurosawa, a Japanese, and two italians, Fellini and Antonioni, subvert just about every rule that Hitchcock laid down; then nothing else happens for thirty years, with Hollywood slowly draining the life out of world cinema (see Transformers 2), until a guy called Quentin Tarantino released this second film, after the poor (or great, if you are a traditionalist) Reservoir Dogs, called Pulp Fiction. And it obliterates every rule that every filmmaker across the civilised world ever tried to establish.John Travolta takes flight to a role so high across the sky that no reviewer is ever going to be able to demolish it, no matter the angle. This is the role that will inspire humans for the next two hundred years; this is the Shakespeare of the modern world. The first director to utilise black actors effectively. The first example of 100% quality production after the dust and sweat of traditional Hollywood arenas. Pulp Fiction is a film of such incredible intricacy that it's unfathomable to anyone but a big-brain film school student, and even than, who knows. Do not feel ashamed if you miss its finer points. But for history, this is the one, the only, the film that takes over from Yojimbo, from 8 1/2, from La Nave Va, from Shichinin no Samurai, and more ... and just moves on forward. There is more film in twenty minutes of PF than there is in the whole of a typical Hollywood production of the 70's. So there are those films above this one. Space Oddissey. The Godfather. These are just targeted products. You will never find someone who has a coherent film critique of Pulp Fiction. Mastery in work, spark of genius, there is no way that this film can be any less than 10/10 and the best film ever made."
13/03/2010,1,"I personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of American society.This is a film in which paid murderers are our heros, who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits.  It features such entrancing scenes as countless murders, S&M rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (it's a wonder Six Flags hasn't opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience).  It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other.  Is this entertainment?The last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes--  the big problem posed by this is 'how will we clean out the car?'  What can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)?  What can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment?The characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the 'good guys.' If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldn't it--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?"
13/03/2010,1,"""Pulp Fiction"" is the classic of classics; Tarantino truly possesses the Midas touch. This 1994 masterpiece is brilliant in all aspects; from the ingenious writing to the wildly witty dialogue to its captivating character creation; the overall excellence of Pulp Fiction makes it not only among the best, but maybe the most rewatchable movie of all time. Nearly every scene is gold and crafted to divine perfection. Pulp Fiction is truly a remarkable feat in the art of filmmaking."
10/03/2010,1,"This was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the ""superstar"" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a ""safe bet"", but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.The film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.For many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).These are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the ""pulp"" literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't... watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible... it's the kind of ""literature"" that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.The actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well."
04/03/2010,1,"This is Quentin Tarantino's legacy. I have never seen such an ensemble all star cast come together so well and perfect in any one film. And to do that, it's the directors job, and he executed this to perfection! Yet another must-have film for any movie lover to have in their collection, to pass down to generations to display film-making perfection! A 10/10 from me!"
28/02/2010,8,"I love this movie. One of the best films from Tarantino. you must see it! This movie is a perfect depiction of Tarantino's style. A perfect blend of action, humor, gore and more. Uma Thurman gives what I consider to be her best performance. There are so many iconic moments throughout the film, used widely in popular culture."
15/02/2010,8,"After the success that he had with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino came back strong with his second written and directed full-length feature film, ""Pulp Fiction"". Some would argue that this neo-noir black crime film is his masterpiece. Like his previous film, this offers just as much violence and brutality, which again is wrapped up with lots of style and substance.This film has seven narrative sequences, with three primary storylines, which are all interwoven, making it a hard watch for some people, while others marvel at its construct. Mob hitman Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the protagonist of storyline 1, Butch Coolidge the boxer (Bruce Willis) is the protagonist of storyline 2, and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is the 3rd storyline protagonist. The film goes from a prologue (diner hold-up), to Vincent, Jules, and then Butch, before going full circle the epilogue and the diner hold-up again.I enjoyed this in the 1990's when I first watched it, and I've never shied away from watching it again given the opportunity. It might not be everybody's cup of tea and it certainly is not for the younger audiences (even of post 2020!), but I enjoy it and can appreciate its technicality. Having the benefit of 20+ years of hindsight it is interesting to see lots of films that have come out since and tried to replicate part of this film, most have failed too. It is a testament to how good this film is though that it can inspire other people to try, not just in film but other mediums too - games, comics, etc. If you have not seen this film it is absolutely worth a watch, and if you have seen it, why not watch it again and find something you missed last time - or discuss some of the themes, homages, or McGuffin's to try and work out your own messages (the gold light in the suitcase for example - I would love to believe it is Marcellus's soul. It ties in with the plaster on the back of his head, and with the combination of '666' on the briefcase - but this has been widely debunked). A cracking film and an enjoyable piece of art - one of Tarantino's finest films in my opinion."
12/02/2010,8,"pulp fiction is as good as film noir gets. tarantino brilliantly weaves his different plots into one madcap movie that just races along. the humour is out of this world, tongue in cheek and nasty. but hey, it works. boy! does it work!!! the actors are all fantastic, personally my favorite characters were honey bunny and pumpkin. they were incredibly funny. not to take anything away from any other character though. each one is a gem. the best thing about this movie is that it stands up to repeated watching. everytime i see the movie its as fresh as the first time and infact i enjoy it more and more. tarantino takes the film noir genre and turns it around with so many amazing twists. its a long movie, but never feels that way. and it is slick!! fast and slick!! i've seen this movie often enough and there is not one scene that i think is out of place or should have been cut out. each scene is full of  wonder and demands your attention. this for me is a great pep up movie. it fills me with energy. i am not very queasy about al the violence and bloodshed. if you are, you might not enjoy it. else, go ahead have a ball and feast on this cracker of a movie. a rip roaring 10!!"
10/02/2010,8,"First off, as I read sometime ago, Tarantino with ""Pulp Fiction"" doesn ´t try to introduce and/or play with a plot, instead he introduces you to a world.  His world.  A world where the so-called ""anti-socials"" are far more complicated than the ""normal people"" (as I´m writting this, and I use the term ""normal people"" I laugh, and feel dirty).  These anti socials are haunted by greater problems.  Self-finding issues. Tarantino uses the questions raised by one-self to make the characters of the movie think about their lives.  To think about what they´re doing with them.  As Jules says, he´s trying to be the sheperd.  Even God gets involved.  Even God has a chance.  Even bad guys can change. In more technical purposes, the director (Q. Tarantino), uses an infinity of signs, and symbols to put us throughout the story...once again, not a simple plot, but a whole world.  The camera movement, although not ground-stomping, jaw-dropping, is fine.  One thumb up.  Fine directing. The story, on the other hand...woooow!  Leaves me speechless, breathless, etc.  It´s an extasy just to read the script, just to think of it as a book.  Hats off for Tarantino as a writter...Avary too.     Finally, bashing a little bit, Tarantino needs some expertise as a director, but his writting skills are top-notch."
05/01/2010,9,"Guy movies do not get much better than this. It has good acting, good action and some of the best catch lines ever.Tarantino has made himself and all those who star in this movie immortal. This movie is not child or young teen appropriate. Lots of blood, lots of shooting, lots of bad words, sexual violence and drug use.But the lines and characters in this movie are so memorable that you like many others will be caught memorizing them and repeating them to your friends. I can not think of any movie that has this many memorable lines.Ezekiel 25-17... and Ohh your gonna blow..."
25/12/2009,8,"Pulp Fiction may be one of the most profoundly misunderstood films of our time. One critic even called  it a ""glorification of two whacked out hit-men"".Others called it 'flippant', ""nihilistic' and ""cynical'. Yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such 'worthless' characters. Yet others called it 'plotless' and 'formless'. However, a careful viewing of Tarantino s film should reveal that , like most of the ""pulp fiction ' on which it is based, it is indeed profoundly moral. Even more, Tarantinos film earnestly grapples with SPIRITUAL issues. Tarantino has carefully studied the films of Dreyer and Bresson, as well as those of Don Spiegel and Phil Karlson.To make my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film, I will merely call attention to the ending of each of its three  episodes. Each one ends with a human life or lives being saved. Yes , there is cynicism, flippancy and studied 'coolness' in Pulp Fiction. However, this is merely the glossy packaging in which Tarantino has concealed his profoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message. This is a film about redemption."
19/12/2009,7,"This movie not so yang, but still great. You were terrified by actor in this story. I think it is best movie from 90-x. Director is very creative person, what stile we can call Tarantino stile. Actors and play is great, when i was watching this movie, i feel atmosphere this story, Sone time i watch again this movie, because i like this story and stile this movie. You can split your live for to part: before watch this movie and after. I like watch this movie which my friend, you can start watching from any part, that is OK. Tarantino is going to great master if he create only this movie, it like icon cinema. I haven't watch movie lake this, i mean so creative and unusually. I recommended this movie for watching."
04/11/2009,10,"It's a movie to learn to like cinema. It could be a linear action movie like most 80's/90's movies, with a strong guy destroying some army with quick dialogues and lots of gunfire. However Pulp Fiction is different, it is deep, violent, funny, intelligent."
11/10/2009,10,"I've seen Pulp Fiction many times and I love it even more every time i watch it. The content is unique for when it was released. The plot has many dimensions that make you notice something different and new every time . The characters are developed and are realistic. There's plenty of drama in the three different stories that are occurring simultaneously. There is a good amount of action, and a little bit of comedy intertwined. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but children, unless drug use and violence offends you. Pulp fiction is a must see. You really see how amazing these actors are. I love Uma Thurman's performance, she really got into the role and perfected it."
29/09/2009,10,"Pulp Fiction is without a doubt Quentin Tarantinos masterwork. It's got some of the most iconic scenes with amazingly entertaining dialogue and unforgettable quotes, all thanks to Tarantino's ingenious screenwriting. The story is unbelievably far out and pretty damn messed up, but it all comes together beatifully in the end like all of Tarantino's works and it just shows how ingenious this mans writing is.Pulp fiction will always be one of the most quotable and entertaining movies ever made because this is Tarantino's masterpiece (And Tarantino only makes entertaining movies).10/10."
05/09/2009,10,"Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite films. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times, but I'm yet to get tired of it. This masterpiece is fast paced, action pact and extremely quotable. Many people consider Pulp Fiction to be Quentin Tarantino's magnum opus. The editing is interesting in that the film is told out of order and the audience has to see it more than once before they can start piecing it together. The directing is fantastic, as per usual with Tarantino. Further following an early Tarantino trend, he casts himself in a small role and as usual, it a terrible actor. Don't let Tarantino's poor acting deter you, the rest of the cast is amazing. Pulp Fiction is thought to be the film that brought back John Travolta's career, but there is much more than that. Nearly the entire cast are legendary actors. Furthering the Tarantino tradition, ""Pulp Fiction"" has an amazing soundtrack. There is nothing bad that I can say about this film. It is honestly the closest thing to film perfection that I can think of."
27/08/2009,7,"If I could give this film a negative 10 it would not begin to describe how horrible it is. There is little to no plot, the story never resolves, and it jumps around in time and sequence so much that it is impossible to make any sense out of it. I fail to see why so many people actually like this film, and why it continues to get great reviews. The only thing this film offers is a lot of graphic violence and blood throughout the entire movie (the only thing that Quentin Tarantino is good for). When you finally do reach the end you find yourself wondering why in the world you just wasted so much time. Time that could have been better spent cleaning your sock drawer."
27/08/2009,7,Personally one of my favorite films this movie encases all kinds of different techniques and sort of confuses the viewer until a certain point where the story all starts to connect. i believe that this movie addresses all aspects of american life and what it means to be an american in this day and age. from references to Big Macs and other staple in current american culture this film never has a slow scene and their is always a surprise just around the corner.
05/08/2009,7,"Vengeance and violent justice are really the premise of this story. Or rather, the FOUR stories intertwined in this film. This film really marked the 1990s as a special decade for US film. The film, and its intertwined stories, go back and forth, bounce between each other for a while, then crescendo into an explosion of violence and justice perhaps, towards the end. We even had a hit-man go clean and profess that he will be a holy monk and wander the earth in peace! The filming techniques are camera use are incredible, and the casting made careers for younger actors (and revived a few, for older ones!). it is my understanding that Tarrantino's editor for Pulp, is the same woman he has used in every film since!"
05/07/2009,9,"Pulp Fiction is a landmark film and one of the best of the nineties. The story revolves around L.A lowlifes which include,two hitmen,bank robbers and a boxer.All played superbly by John Travolta,Samuel.L Jackson and Bruce Willis. Quentin Tarintino`s script is brilliant and whoever has seen this would agree with me,it has excellent dialogue and everything fits in. Everything about this movie is top notch,the acting,the screenplay,the cinematography and direction. Overall a defining moment in film history and a great film.10/10"
30/06/2009,9,"Pulp Fiction is one of the last great American films of the 20th century, a pastiche of crime, thriller and action tropes compressed into one masterwork of directing, story-telling and comedy. After viewing this film so many times that I have lost track within the last year alone, I never fail to see more hidden details and more beauty within Tarantino's work here. I would argue that this film surpasses all of the elements inspiring it, that it is truly a film greater than the sum of its' parts. The fractured narrative, dark comedy and characters all weave you into a world that is grimy and filthy yet never loses its' veneer of pure, unadulterated fun. The film draws you in with it's one-liners about Big Kahuna burger and the famous scene in Jimmy's kitchen, but what really enthralls me as a viewer is the masterful way in which Tarantino draws the viewer into the live's of these characters, removes the low-brow quality normally associated with excessive gore and obscenities, and with it makes art out of the dark aspects of human nature."
23/06/2009,9,"Pulp Fiction has some very funny parts. I think the funniest has to be when John Travolta says ""What's up buddy"" to Bruce Willis, and Willis says ""Your not my buddy"". There's such a dark humored tone to that scene. The famous ""royale with cheese"" and ""dog got personality"" are also funny. But there are other scenes, like Willis and his girlfriend in the hotel room, where I'm screaming mercy. They are dreadfully boring scenes. And I'm still not sure what the movie was about. So all in all, Pulp Fiction is a better than average movie. But it's not a ""great"" movie like some people rave. ""Jackie Brown"", Quientin Trantino's other hit, is just as good. And if your looking for a dark humored comedy, check out ""Fargo"" which is much better"
17/06/2009,9,"I have never understood why people love this movie so much. It isn't a bad movie but it simply is not great.Yes I understand the plot. No I don't like stupid romantic comedies or anything like like. I am a big Scorsese and Oliver Stone fan.This movie is not terribly smart not violent in any way we haven't seen before. What this movie did is dress it up in hip clothes so high school kids and young adults would identify with it.If you want gritty and smart, watch a Scorsese picture. If you want over the top violence, watch Natural Born Killers.If you want trendy and ""cool"", watch Pulp Fiction."
30/05/2009,1,"I don't think I can describe in words the immense impact Pulp Fiction (and as a matter of fact, all of Tarantino's work) has had on me both as a person and a filmmaker. It's brilliant, it's exciting, it's fascinating and extraordinarily executed - it's everything a film should be. Watching Pulp Fiction just brings me true joy, in a way that no other film is able to - it fulfills the purpose of art, in my opinion, to the highest degree."
25/05/2009,1,I've heard about this film for years. I always pushed it away because I thought old films weren't really my thing. They were always so raw but too long for me. But pulp fiction has to be one of the best films. I have never seen such a comedic and raw movie that would keep me at the edge of my seat. The fact that the first scene fitted so well with the last scene is amazing.
09/05/2009,1,"Not one movie can claim to have half the entertaining dialogue that this movie has. From beginning to end, not one word is out of place, or boring. Many movies may have one piece of dialogue that elevates the movie enough for you to like it, but Pulp Fiction is sheer joy of conversation, paired with situation after situation of pure excitement.I am sure I will never seen a movie that will be this much fun again! In fact, this movie alone has convinced me that Tarantino has to be the greatest movie maker of all time. This is my go to movie when I can't make up my mind what to watch; I am guaranteed satisfaction!The movie has no plot! It is a collection of out-of-sequence stories that make up the last few days of the life of a hit man, played by Travolta. That's it! He and his partner are simply taking care of an errand and it goes wrong, while he also has to take his boss's wife out for dinner to keep her entertained while he (the boss) goes out of town for the night. That, too, goes wrong. Every single thing in that movie just goes horribly wrong and it's just fabulous.The acting is compelling. The cinematography is masterful and just sets a nostalgic mood that makes you want to return to. The direction is ... oh well ... Tarantino. And the dialogue is the best ever. Really.Please see it."
26/02/2009,8,"Tarantino's best work. The 4 tales going on and how he mingles them is good. Seeing the theological hints. The connection of Mia and Vincent was good. Going to extremes and tear things apart. How to correct mistakes and behave when things are going wrong. The respect for ones elders. Cashing on the chips when it matters, betrayals and the settlement. Acting and background score is great. Luck, honesty choice of free will, secrets and mistakes. Worth the time. What really was in the box is a secret though that makes it more interesting."
23/12/2008,7,"Have you ever gone from one extreme to the other on an issue? Our President excluded, many of us change our minds about things on a daily basis. When it comes to philosophies or preferences, we're not static creatures because we realize obstinance is not a virtue. We change, we evolve - that is to be human.Well, my opinion of Pulp Fiction has underwent several cataclysmic upheavals since I first saw the film in its year of release, 1994. I was 14 and, without exaggerating, Pulp Fiction shattered my concept of film. I'd never been so excited, intrigued and in love with a film. It forced me to reconsider what quality cinema was - it was no longer just the greats, the Best Picture winners, etc. Great cinema could be anything - old gangster movies, film noir, B-horror flicks, 1950s melodrama. The film also prompted me to explore film on a more academic basis, as I began reading film theory and film criticism regularly.I worshiped at the shrine of Tarantino and watched everything he put his hands on - be that Destiny Turns on the Radio or 4 Rooms.His other work (even Reservoir Dogs, which, I am convinced, is nothing more than a decent first film) disappointed me, but I never once second-guessed Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown in 1997 re-affirmed my faith in the man, but then he disappeared and a funny thing happened, I second guessed Pulp Fiction.The dialogue, which I once thought brilliant, was not stilted and forced - a little too hip for its own good. The acting was all right, but seemed weaker than I remembered, and the once brilliant story became trite. The masterpiece became, in my eyes, pretentious, though still watchable fare. On my list of 100 favorite films, it fell from the top-10 to the upper 70s.Years went by, I continually found myself drawn to Jackie Brown (I think it's Tarantino's most mature wok and a wrongfully maligned masterpiece), but I avoided Pulp Fiction. A friend who had never seen the film asked one day if we could throw my copy on and it was like watching it for the first time.Everything that seemed forced or trite was brilliant. The dialogue that seemed overly stylized now seemed perfectly stylized and, really, perfectly at odds with the plot, which, though it contains recycled elements, became an energetic, hyper-kinetic, and amazing narrative again.Pulp Fiction quickly returned to the top of my favorites list. Why the swift rising and falling? I have no idea. It could be that QT created a film that is so tied to its audience's state of mind that their reaction to it is a complete crap shoot for him. That's doubtful. What I think truly happened is this: my adolescent mind reacted to its pop-culture references and its manic pace. It was hip and cool, really, and therefore perfect for your alterna teenagers. I matured, grew disdainful of things hip and cool (it was obviously cooler to dislike things that were cool right?), and so began disliking PF. I grew up a little more, became a little more perceptive, and therefore able to appreciate exactly what QT does with narrative and dialogue. Pulp Fiction, though this may seem odd, is a very subtle movie. Its brilliance at first seems superficial, but dig a little deeper and you'll find a film that is narratively amazing and that carries emotional weight. It's not all style; it's not just hip. It's an intelligent and wonderful movie and I don't think that I'll change my mind on it again."
09/11/2008,10,"The plot of a boxer, two hit men, and two robbers collide together to make the movie spectacular.  This is one of Quentin Tarantino's best films. One of the top ten movies of the 90's.  It creates a plot unthinkable by any other human.  The movie is just depicted as a classic."
03/11/2008,10,"Pulp Fiction', directed by Quentin Tarantino, is the cinematic equivalent of a boundary-pushing, flamboyantly dressed, and audacious rock star. It's brash, it's daring, and it's a whole lot of fun. Released in 1994, this film is an anthology of interwoven narratives and eclectic characters that still resonates with audiences today.The ensemble cast, including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, deliver performances that are nothing short of brilliant. They breathe life into Tarantino's larger-than-life characters, with each one leaving an indelible mark. The chemistry between Travolta and Jackson, in particular, provides some of the film's most memorable moments.The screenplay is quintessential Tarantino. It's bursting with colorful dialogue, memorable one-liners, and a non-linear structure that somehow all comes together perfectly. Scenes effortlessly shift from philosophical discussions about European fast-food joints to adrenaline-pumping moments of violence. It's a ride that only Tarantino can take you on, and it's thoroughly enjoyable.Technically, the film is a treat. The camera work, led by cinematographer Andrzej Sekula, is inventive, the editing is sharp, and the soundtrack is a character in itself. From the opening credits, set to Dick Dale's blistering rendition of 'Misirlou', to the closing moments with 'Surf Rider' by The Lively Ones, the music perfectly complements the film's rollercoaster vibe.'Pulp Fiction' also deserves credit for reviving the careers of several of its stars, notably John Travolta and Bruce Willis. But perhaps the film's most significant legacy is its influence on pop culture. Even if you haven't seen the film, you've likely come across references to its iconic scenes, whether it's Uma Thurman's dance sequence or Samuel L. Jackson's Bible-quoting hitman.If there are any criticisms, they're likely to be subjective. Some viewers may find the film's violence excessive, and its moral ambiguity discomforting. But these are also what make 'Pulp Fiction' so uniquely enjoyable and memorable.In conclusion, 'Pulp Fiction' is a cinematic experience like no other. It's a film that embraces its eccentricities and flaunts them with a sense of joyous rebellion. The result is a wildly entertaining ride that's fun, thought-provoking, and undeniably cool. If cinema is a dance, 'Pulp Fiction' is the twist contest you never knew you needed. So, grab your milkshake and let the music play."
15/10/2008,10,"Pulp Fiction excels in its cast. The performances from all the lead actors are phenomenal, with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta especially standing out for their memorable dialogue and on-screen chemistry. The film's soundtrack, featuring classic rock and soul hits, perfectly complements the dynamics and atmosphere of each scene.Overall, Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece that combines a brilliant script, exceptional performances and innovative direction. It is a film that has not only stood the test of time, but continues to inspire new generations of filmmakers and audiences.The best movie of all time!"
11/09/2008,10,"Synopsis: I really can't tell you much about this film because I do not want to ruin the experience. This is one of those movies that is best left a secret, but what I can tell you is that it's legendary, remarkable, and re-watchable. Each scene is simply classic and the dialog is thick but so incredibly clever that one hungers for it. The acting is absolutely fabulous. John and Uma have such chemistry during the ""dance scene""--it was engaging and enthralling. Samuel L. Jackson delivers his infamous ""speech"" with such fervor and vengeance that the words are as bullets. I also remember laughing heavily at the dark humor and simple bizzareness of this gem. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a quirky gangster film on its surface but when one digs a little deeper it is a story about redemption. Notice the difference between the fates of John and Samuel's characters, and also notice how Bruce redeems himself. This would all be well and good enough as it is, but Quentin is not done yet. Not only does he bring forth an arsenal of brilliant directing (his classic ""car trunk"" shot), but he also makes a circular film (the beginning and the end are the same). This movie is great, just simply fantastic. And another lovely bonus is that ""Pulp Fiction"" never gets old, which is something hard to come by nowadays. ""Pulp Fiction"" is probably the best movie of the 90's and is certainly one of the best films of all time, and I mean that. The only people who will not like ""Pulp Fiction"" are dumbasses (who will get confused by the story format), the squeamish (who don't like gruesome screen violence), and right-wingers (who think that sex,violence, and profanity are the earmarks of a bad movie). All and all I give ""Pulp Fiction"": 5 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic 2005 Imaginist"
16/08/2008,6,"I watched this cult classic on 1st january,2022 for the very first time and it still feels fresh!! Maybe that is the real magic about this movie. I know some people might call it ""overrated"", well I am not saying it is a masterpiece but it did entertain me a lot. Sometimes movie are all about entertainment. If someone wants to sit down in front of a tv after a exhausted day and wants to watch something to lighten his mood , then this is a perfect movie for you my friend .This movie is technically good too. The way Tarantino wrote a clever script and tied his audience with a movie with such an ordinary story, is really impressive . The acting, humor, violence and use of music is top notch. And last but not the least Uma Thurman ,THE BEAUTY!!!!"
17/07/2008,9,"It definitely has it's moments, but in the end it isn't a movie that demands multiple viewings. It's not subtle and isn't very realistic. It's still a trip down the rabbit hole to see Tarantino's mind on display, but why is he in all his movies? The excessive language actually takes more from the film than it adds upon subsequent viewings. The movie is good, but by no means worthy of it's high ranking in the ""IMDB top 250"". It was very trendy for a time to LOVE this film and many non-film fans thought they were being ""hip"" for jumping on the bandwagon. Has it done anything to advance the art of cinema?"
18/06/2008,9,"I went to Paris recently. Whilst walking down the famous Champs Elysees, I decided to check out the local MacDonald's just to see exactly what they do call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese. To my disappointment, it wasn't ""Royale with Cheese"" (or should that read ""avec fromage""?) but something slightly different.. I forget what it was exactly, but that's not important...To call a movie like Pulp Fiction special is like... well.. it's special. A special movie. Masterpiece, even. Tarantino's script must rank among the sharpest and wittiest ever written. A lot of the dialogue is completely unnecessary as far as narrative goes, it does very little to forward the plot. Yet it is the dialogue that makes the movie so compelling and holds the interest of the audience just as well as any brilliantly told story could. This isn't to say that the movie has no decent narrative flow or substance to the story. Far from it. Tarantino's less than chronological way of telling this story makes it all the more intriguing. On first viewing, this may baffle viewers throughout most of the presentation. However, such a feeling just makes the final diner scene (where everything ties together) all the more satisfying. The three stories that are chronicled in this film are all unique, yet filled with the same brilliant drama and dark humour that wowed audiences of Tarantino's two previously penned films, Reservoir Dogs and True Romance.The characters in this movie are unforgettable and brilliantly written. Each and every event in the movie contributes greatly to the personality of each of them. By the end of it, we feel greatly acquainted with those that have the most limited screentime. They are backed up by a superbly talented all star cast. My two personal favourite performances being those of the fantastic Samuel L. Jackson (in a brilliant break-through role) as the wise-cracking hitman Jules Winnfield, and the legendary Harvey Keitel as the wonderfully odd fix-it man Winston Wolfe. Honourable mention should also go to the always outstanding Christopher Walken in his small but intriguing part as Captain Koons. Needless to say, the rest of the cast do Tarantino proud and all give some of the best of their career.At less than ten years old, Pulp Fiction is regarded as one of the finest of offerings in over a hundred years of cinema. It is one of the most important films of the twentieth century. Watch it, if you don't like it, keep watching it until you do. 9/10 (because I never give tens)."
30/05/2008,1,"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss."
27/05/2008,1,"Would it be too much to say Tarantino re-invented the cinema with this film? I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone. You can tell - especially in gangster films - they never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most quotable dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, fun ride that you feel stoned/dizzy/drunk after watching it eachtime. Despite originally thinking it was slightly overhyped, seeing it again and again has brought me to realise what it is. It's 'Pulp Fiction' and it's amazing."
21/05/2008,1,"The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.""It's only entertainment,"" I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two."
18/05/2008,1,"I thought that the ""best"" of Tarantino's work is this one, considering the fans and the rate, but it was not far from the others. I expected a better violence cinematography, but was bellow Once upon a time. It was better and it was the only thing I liked about it: the storytelling, but that's it. Most of the plots were predictable. I think most of the fans loved Samuel's character journey, but for me wasn't enough and impressing, a bit dull even. He almost deserved that Oscar nomination, Quentin too, but Uma and John weren't worthy. Their screen time were too short and inconsistent to be that praising as everyone does. Hateful eight, still my favorite and best of all. Change my mind! Peace!"
17/05/2008,1,"The USA can't offer much to the world, it's far too immature, black and childish for that but it can offer us a truly delightful film such as this masterpiece. I really liked the heavy use of drugs in this movie, it gave me tears of joy to see characters having the time of their lives on drugs and made me very nostalgic for my drug fuelled happy days as a youngster at Eton (Mess).The heavy use of drugs, violence, profanity and sex in this film has positively influenced an entire sexy generation of British people and I can't thank the United States enough for that, from youngish Brits swearing every 5 seconds to the cheeky games of hide and seek finding marijuana in the London Underground and asking waitresses for free sex after every bad meal at restaurants, this film truly has changed British culture for the better, I'm so proud of the beautiful ex-British colony known as the United States due to this film.The sexual abuse at the end of the film has also made the UK more aware of sexual abuse of males, this film has made many Brits more self-aware that men aren't invincible, they can be sexually abused and this film highlights the harsh brutal reality of that heinous crime so I thank this film for making Britain a safer place for men. I also really liked the diner scene, the best diner I've ever seen onscreen and just so stunningly beautiful, it truly does look heavenly that place and every happy night I have I dream of going to that diner with a few of my British mates and gently bonding with our lovely American children."
14/05/2008,1,"Tarentino's masterpiece has sent shockwaves through the entire film industry.  So many films are clones of it, try to imitate the dialogue, or hype, where applicable, their stars ""of Pulp Fiction fame."" Pulp Fiction features dialogue that rings true to life, unpredictable plot turns, and plenty of humor.  To best enjoy this movie, know as little about it before viewing it.  The non-linear plot serves a purpose and is not merely a gimmick.  It puts the most fitting part at the end of the film.  Truly a historic film in many ways."
14/04/2008,4,"I am not much for writing reviews, so this will be brief, as well as the polar opposite of profound. I saw this movie when I was 17 and it changed my life. Up to that point, movies I watched were one dimensional action flicks with cliché characters and predictable plots. Pulp Fiction made me laugh, cringe, yell out loud, cover my eyes and get nauseated. It was the first movie that I saw that I couldn't stop thinking about for days after. I watched it again and again, picking up new details, and connecting the dots. This film opened my eyes up to a whole different genre of movies and a whole new appreciation for storytelling. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and in some ways, still is. It is full of memorable characters, scenes and quotes. Simply awesome."
13/03/2008,1,"Recently I've managed to watch this movie and I have to admit, that the experience,it gave to me, was unique. However, the plot is a bit complicated, because of the timeline, the unexpected actions and twists make this film truly unforgettable. I can honestly recommend this film to anyone, who loves Quentin Tarantino."
25/02/2008,8,"Pulp Fiction was one of the greatest films of last century; Tarantino intertwines the story six main characters in an original tale of redemption. The iconic opening conversation about what they call fast-food abroad, between the two mob men, Vincent and Jules, sets a trend of witty dialogue and black comedy throughout the film. Vince (Travolta) seems to be the most thuggish of the pair who clearly enjoys his brutal job, where as Jules (Samuel Jackson) comes across as the more virtuous, spitting out memorable biblical quotes throughout the film. The layered masterpiece must be watched again and again to enjoy its full potential. With a simple yet uniquely assembled plot this film plays host to a string of great characters that will never be beaten, nor will there ever be a film quite like it."
22/02/2008,8,"The movie is really wonderful. A must watch for anyone who likes movies, or the art of movie making or the art of story telling. The most impressive are the cast and the story which has unforgettable opening and closing scenes.Adding to this is the fabulous guitar when the starting titles come on. Loved the movie from beginning to end. The Uma Thurman and Travolta dance is not to be missed. This is a wonderful and hilarious way of depicting the LA crime scene and Hit men activities. Very raw and straightforward way of story telling with in your face explicit language which adds to the real feel of the movie."
07/02/2008,8,"This movie by Quentin was one of excellent originality. Not only did it display the ""other half"" of the gangster image, it was also successful in its acting, and clever in certain scenes that I only notices when watching the special features of the 2 disc DVD. This movie is important because it, in a very clever way, SIMULTANEOUSLY portrays gangsters as invincible and vulnerable, witless people. Samuel Jackson and John Travolta wield 45 magnums like a toy gun, murder a number of people in the process, as if they are truly above the law. On the contrary, they are contradictory to the usual gangsters of the past, like the Godfather or Jimmy Hoffa. In these movies, they are seen as godlike and untouchable; idolized in today's society and envied by many inner city citizens. In Pulp Fiction, we are given another look at this ""untouchable"" image because the two gangsters portrayed here are often sloppy, and occasionally witless. An example is the dismembering of Marvin, the accomplice of Jules and Vincent, which displays Vincent's stupidity. Talking about buying a beer in Paris and hash bars in Amsterdam. Letting Mia Wallace snort 1500 of Choco heroine which, obviously, is not supposed to go into the nose. Not to mention Vincent leaving a silenced on the a counter for Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to find and murder him with. Even Marsellus Wallace (portrayed as an invincible kingpin) is raped by two men.The ""time"" factor. Most people, when watching the movie, did not realize that in the beginning, you can picture John Travolta walking to the bathroom behind Honeybunny, or Jules talking in the background about eating his muffin (this all happens while Pumpkin is talking about the benefits of robbing a restaurant). When watching the movie several times, it is clever how Tarantino manages to separate each scene and split them up at different moments in time, leaving us small clues that allows to pick apart his cleverness. I'll bet you were confused when they shot the two people (in nice black and white suits) and retrieved the briefcase (after the Bruce Willis piece) they arrive at the bar in t-shirts and short shorts. If you noticed, the bar does not open until noon (or 10am?), if I remember correctly. They arrive at the apartment just short of 7:30 am when they murdered Flock of Seagulls, Brett and the ""seinfeld"" guy. Marvin is shot and when they arrive at Jimmy's house, it is about 8:20. They are given less than 40 minutes to clean the car, and dispose of the clothes and the body. When the restaurant is robbed, it is approx. 9:27 as displayed in the kitchen where Pumpkin is seen hollering at Hispanic dishwashers. When you notice this; how it was timed and well planned, it is all the more brilliant.""Pulp Fiction"" also has great irony to it. When they are in the bar, Bruce Willis is done talking to Marsellus Wallace and encounters John travolta. John Travolta Condescends the boxer, referring to him as ""palooka"" and ""punchy"". 2/3 through the movie, John Travolta dies at the hands of? Bruce willis by his own weapon. Another irony linked to this is in the apartment when he survives six shots from a 357 magnum! Vincent Vega blows it off while Jules takes it seriously. The same situation occurs in the apartment when Vincent dies and Jules lives because he quits ""the life"" apparently at the perfect time.Perhaps the most underrated portion of the movie is its music. From Dick Dale and the Del Tones to Kool and the Gang and Al Green, they blend in with the movie. Tarantino did not choose songs that were popular in 1994, but songs that he personally thought did not get credit they deserve. Thanks to excellent editing by Sally Menke, the songs blend into each scene; they do not overpower the scene and distract you from it, but pull you into it, and often have you singing along with it if the song is familiar. Unknown songs are chose and ignored the first time. But when watching this movie again, I appreciated it more because when i really listened to the songs, i found them to be entertainment. The Misirlou at the beginning, in a way, sets the tone of the whole movie. Al green's ""Lets Stay Together"" is now his most famous song; mellow and fits the scene in which it is played. It is the trademark of all Tarantino's movies. When you watch his other movies, I'll guarantee that the opening song will set the mood for the movie. Kill Bill, and Reservoir Dogs are good examples. When I first watched this movie, I was nine years old. I did not have the ability to apply critical thinking to this movie, until i recently bought this movie on a 2 disc DVD. The interweaving of the plots and an excellent cast have immortalized this movie and made it one to study and analyze for years to come."
24/01/2008,8,"First of all my comment doesn't have spoilers because there is absolutely nothing to spoil. I intended to watch Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 which I really liked because of the same director Quentin Tarantino. He became my favourite director after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 but no longer when I seen Pulp Fiction. It has all the possible bad things in a film and the list is endless. There is nothing but drug use and swearing that made my ears bleed, the F word was repeated more times than the number of heartbeats of a person's lifetime. None of the stories were appealing...in fact I just don't know what's going on because there was no structure or plot. The film was about 2.5 hours and I hated every second, it was Extremely boring that I had a sore head & I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. Anyway I can go on forever.I just don't know why it's #5 on the IMDb top 250? Maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10. Quentin Tarantino must have pulled the script from his bum and was running about in a circle with it then his wife must of hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said, ""You promised me no more rubbish films!"" He must of found a brain in a fruit bowl before he made Kill Bill he also looks like a idiot and talks like a girl. Now I don't intend to watch Reservoir Dogs. Crap Fiction is now definitely on my top 5 worst films of all time and is in second place. First is either Jackass the movie 1 or 2.It is critically acclaimed because 97% of critics have no brains and the rest of the 3% have cheated in their exams. That is why they always give good reviews to bad films and bad reviews to good films. Overall no matter what ever happens there will never be a worse film than Crap Fiction. Any movie in the IMDb bottom 100 is better and I would like to salute anyone who has given it a 1 out of 10. This whole comment is only 1% expression of hate to this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film."
02/01/2008,8,"This movie is full of obscanities, violence, it is gritty, gutter, shocking, real...and definetly the best.  What makes this movie, and not Slumber Party Massacre the best, is that this movie provides insight on the life of hitmen.  Generally speaking, a day in the life of a hitman, not really there life.  From what I seen, it was a day in the life of Jules and Vincent. That's why this movie is so excellent.  It is just nothing anybody has ever seen, and the title warns you before you enter the theater, and also provides a definition of ""pulp"" before the movie starts.  The performances are amazing, providing an all star cast, throughout.  It's kinda hard who takes the cake.. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta both provide amazing performances....Rossana Arqueete is great as a peircing junkie, Uma Thurman, well, watch it and youll see... and so on and so on.What is there not to like about this movie?  If your looking for a ""gone With the Wind"" you will not find it, this is a gritty, gutter movie, not afarid to let anything go, which is why Quentin Tarantino is my idol."
27/11/2007,10,"Maybe I've watched it 20 times, I get a different taste every time I watch it. I guess if I shot, directed and acted a movie myself, I could only be so attached to it."
12/10/2007,10,"What can I say...my favorite movie until I saw this one was Mortal Kombat...lol I have to admit that when I was younger and I saw this movie, I didn't think it was all that, in fact, I found it long and boring. I guess at that age, I must've been about 14, I wanted to see more action, more blood, and all that simple stuff that you're attracted to as a young teenager. Now that i'm 23, and more grown up, and actually care about the movies' plots and story lines, depending if the movie is supposed to be taken seriously, I say this movie is a masterpiece that will never be equaled by any other! Pulp Fiction is great from start to finish. Tarantino's idea of showing the movie cropped up in different episodes and have them scrambled all over the movie in the same order he wrote the script I think it's great. It shows his creative genius as a screenwriter and how he can make the movie makes sense in the end, and it's good brain candy for the viewer. Now on to the characters: Sam Jackson's Jules has to be hands down my favorite movie character of all time. His coolness is hardly matched by any other character in movie history, and it's only complimented by John Travolta's character and partner in the movie, Vincent Vega. Although Vincent Vega in my opinion is way less cool and dumber and more annoying, Travolta does a great job playing Vega. Ving Rhames as Marcellus Wallace is great as well, playing the fearsome mobster, who the entire movie revolves around. Bruce Willis is great as an aging boxer who follows his instinct and honors his blood by refusing to throw a boxing match, angering Marcellus Wallace who earlier in the movie, tried to convinced him he's washed up and should do it. Uma Thurman is perfect and sexy as Marcellus Wallace's wife Mia, and her screen time with Travolta is nothing short of Hollywood gold. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Harvey Keitel, as Winston Wolf, the man who solves ""problems"" and who thinks fast, talks fast, and drives very f-'in fast so you better keep up. He is a delight to watch, especially when seen opposite Travolta's character Vincent, who in the movie tests his cool with one of his usual smart-ass comments. Keitel really commands the screen when he's on it and while he's on it steals the spotlight away from Jackson and Travolta. Quentin Tarantino, making a brief appearance as Jules friend Jimmy is pretty good too, not great but pretty good and funny as well, but I still rather see Tarantino behind the camera than in front of it. Eric Stoltz, hilarious as Lance the dope dealer, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as diner robbers Pumpkin and Hunny Bunny, great as well and everybody else, even Mad TV's Phil LaMarr in a very brief appearance as one of Vincent and Jules' victims. Every single line in this movie is worth listening to and being quoted in endless websites because the dialogue is the best in recent movie history, yes, there's lots of profanity, but that's what Tarantino wants us to see, that his characters' dialogue is just like yours and mine and they talk about the same stuff you and I talk about on our way to work and quote the same TV or movie characters you and me do. That and of course the music, every single song they play in this movie perfectly fits the mood of every scene and that's what make those songs stick in your head for days. This movie deserved all the Golden Globes, Palm D'or, and Oscars it won. A true 90's classic! 10 out of 10"
04/09/2007,10,"Pulp Fiction is a cinematic masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino, delivering a unique experience with incredible twists and unforgettable scenes. The film cleverly intertwines multiple storylines, keeping the viewer engaged from start to finish. Each segment is expertly crafted, with superb pacing that alternates between intense moments and sharp, memorable dialogues. The stunning use of color in every scene adds a remarkable visual dimension, making the film feel truly timeless. It's a brilliant blend of suspense, humor, and artistry that has earned its place as one of the greatest films ever made."

22/07/2007,9,"Not only is there a reason this film has gotten so much praise, but the amount of energy and soul put into this classic 90's flick is just great. The casting is almost perfect for their parts. I don't like spoiling movies so I'm just going to leave all of it there. This movie still is kinda of like a roller coaster ride, but one that is somewhat slow and you enjoy the hour that you're on it. Unlike most other movies where the hour is too fast and it feels like its never going to end. The pacing, casting, acting, cinematography is all great. Who knew the genius behind reservoir dogs could still have some good creativity inside of him. I know it sounds like i'm praising too much and everything. You just need to watch it yourself there is a reason why it's a classic"
22/06/2007,9,"When a first saw pulp fiction I was overwhelmed that Hollywood could make such movies. A film that includes a cast like pulp fiction starring so many top actors, you couldn't expect nothing but a masterpiece. Well you couldn't be more right. Pulp Fiction includes every ingredient a good film should have, humor, action, a good script, good actors and good acting. In my top ten list it's number five. I really recomment this to people who like movies from this genre."
18/06/2007,9,"Quentin Taratino really outdid himself with this movie. ""Pulp Fiction"" is truly hardcore, has plenty of action and truly got meaning in these intertwined stories. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play mob hit men Vincent and Jules. Jules is a Bible Thumper, while Vincent is just unsure about anything. Uma Thurman plays Mia Wallace, a fun-loving, drug-using babe who wants to have fun. She and Vincent go to a restaurant win a twist contest, would OD on dope, and gets pumped in the heart with adrenaline to revive her. Her husband is ruthless mob boss, Marsellus Wallace(Ving Rhames). Bruce Willis plays boxer Butch Coolidge, who crossed paths with Wallace, fights him to a pawn shop both he and Wallace ended up fair game when the owner and his brother Zed(Peter Greene) are sodomites. The Gimp scene is a classic. Tries to warn the others about Butch's escape, he lets the gimp have it. Butch would get a katana sword, go stealth on the brothers, sees Marsellus get violated by Zed, kills the owner, and stalls Zed while Marsellus seeks revenge by saying, ""Step Aside, Butch"". Butch may got even with the owner, but Zed is Marsellus' business now. Vincent and Jules are seemingly unstoppable when the roommate failed to kill them off. They let him have it! It was a pity when Vincent's gun blew away the young man's head off in the car. And the diner scene, classic. Real in-your-face action is in this movie. Watch it! 5 stars!"
22/04/2007,5,"A hilariously violent and extremely well written script. ""Pulp Fiction"" is built in such a nonlinear fashion that you could watch it a dozen times and still not remember what happens next. It doubles back on itself, telling a series of interconnected stories about characters who live in a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses, and loud desperation. The title is ideal. The film, like the old pulp magazines ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and ""Official Detective,"" creates a world with no normal people or days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom."
13/04/2007,4,"Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Quentin Tarantino. It won an Oscar for best dialogue and was beaten for best picture by Forrest Gump.Pulp Fiction tells the story of two mob hit men played by John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson, a mob boss played by Ving Rhames, the mob boss's wife played by Uma Thurman and a boxer played by Bruce Willis. Every single actor/actress in this film plays the role brilliantly especially Samuel L Jackson. The part which makes this film so good is its dialogue. About 90% of this film is just people sitting around talking, but the dialogue is so well written and interesting, you could sit and watch them for hours. This film deserved its Oscar by miles. All those who go into this film expecting lots of shoot outs and explosions, are not going to be impressed due to its long, dialogue heavy scenes.It has no philosophical messages or parts where you need to ""read between the lines"", if you want a film like that, then I suggest you go and watch something directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's a straight up entertaining film which you don't even need to watch all the way through once you've watched it a few times. This film will go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion, it is the greatest film of all time along with Schindlers List."
04/04/2007,6,"Sometimes after seeing a lot of good movies people want to watch something undefined and different,but it does not necessarily mean that the movie is good.When the theme song is the best part of the movie you surely can understand the quality.Sometimes ranking and charts do not show the real picture,this movie does not have a good story,a good screenplay or good dialogues but still it is in the top 10.But believe me this movie can neither give you entertainment nor any sense of understanding.Yeah i agree the movie is not boring,but it is not enjoyable either.Movies like shawshank redemption,godfather or lord of the rings,all of them has a magic-feature.Sometimes it is screenplay(Shawshank redemption) sometimes its dialogue(Godfather) sometimes it is the story (The lord of the rings) .But all of them had the important feature called continuity.I think it is a very important quality of a movie to keep it's continuity.This movie is divided into four parts which actually made the movie look like a comedy-puppet dance just with humans(Because the parts do not define one-another). The most embarrassing thing about this movie is after watching it you will think who is the fool yourself or the writer and directer.Yes this movie is different but not always Difference make something great at least in motion pictures at least.Whatever this is a must see movie for all because you can differentiate the better movies after watching it."
22/03/2007,1,"The film written by Quentin is truly an astonishing masterpiece. This story is divided into four parts which is hard to conclude it with several sentences. Mr. Tarantino did an perfect job on characterization. Every person was vividly portrayed. For example, at the begining of the film, Marsellus Wallace didn't show up, but we could know from the conversation between Jules and Vincent that he is such a powerful gangster and nobody who knows him dare to mess with him. And Vincent was also shaped in different angles and details. In the movie, he is a man of humer, a good partner, and the spot in this movie which is dramatic when he killed by Butch. The movie was full of black humer and it might wants to say, nobody would be the 'righteous man' in the world of violence, but their character is vividly brought to your attention by Quentin, which makes up this high-scoring movie"
31/01/2007,8,"HI! My name is David and this is my first comment and I'm really nervous. I'm from Barcelona and I don't speak English very well, but I will try to write the best that I can. For me, Pulp Fiction has one of the most important scenes of the movies history: The twist. It's the best dance in a movie and the most important. And for me it's also funny because they're drugged, and their expressions and faces are incredible. A lot of people says that Quentin is crazy. Well, it's probably, but all genius are a little crazyThank youDon't hate me for these words"
15/01/2007,8,"LEGENDARY.""Pulp Fiction"" is an absolute masterpiece that redefined the crime genre and left an indelible mark on cinema. Quentin Tarantino's brilliant storytelling, combined with a stellar ensemble cast, makes this film a timeless classic. The non-linear narrative structure keeps you captivated, piecing together the puzzle-like storyline. Each character is meticulously crafted and flawlessly portrayed, bringing depth and complexity to their roles. The dialogues are sharp, witty, and oftentimes darkly humorous, giving the film its distinctive Tarantino touch. The soundtrack is a work of art, enhancing the scenes and creating an unforgettable atmosphere. ""Pulp Fiction"" takes risks, breaks conventions, and seamlessly blends violence with philosophical musings. It's a bold and daring exploration of human nature, morality, and redemption. With its iconic scenes, unforgettable quotes, and unforgettable characters like Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, this film has become a cultural phenomenon. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a true cinematic treasure that continues to inspire and entertain audiences, cementing its well-deserved place in the pantheon of great movies."
10/01/2007,8,"This movie is classic Tarantino with the use of his trademark camera angles, gore, and fowl language. This film is one of my favorite movies of all time because of how unique it is from other movies. The casting choice of Samuel L Jackson and John Trovolta were perfect and can't imagine anyone else playing these characters. The dialogue in this movie was perfect and is half of what made this movie so great. I also loved how the chapters in the movie were mixed up and really made you think when the movie was over. I recommend this film to anyone who loves fast paced movies with great dialogue."
07/01/2007,9,"There is only one word that can describe this movie, Genius! This movie is Quentin Tarrantino at his best. Of all the people I watched the movie with, not one of them said it was anything less that brilliant. You will find yourself quoting this movie for weeks and weeks to come. This is the best movie since the Godfather. If there is one movie Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis or Tim Roth should be remembered for it is this one. A classic Samuel L. Jackson movie. No other movie has a dialouge like this. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat for the two and half hours that fly by while you enjoy this classic."
03/01/2007,8,"It has taken me 21 years of life to watch Pulp Fiction, I have seen most other work by Tarantino and I really liked it, Django being a standout, to me PF is good, it has 3 core stories that all link in a really satisfying way, BUT I don't think it is a 10/10 like most people here are making out, let me explain why but I'll start with my likes.The acting, every single character in this movie has a quality, we don't deeply know them but they do stand out as they are all fairly diverse, Jules and Vincent are my favourites and to me the main characters, I even liked Tarantino himself I thought he was funny.The stories were all quite good, I wasn't to into Bruce Willis's story as much but definitely the last part I really enjoyed of him.I liked the majority of the timeline but when Bruce goes home, eh I wasn't too keen on that happening before the end of the movie.The pacing was a little slow getting into it, a criticism in most of his movies which takes away a bit for me, also the hype as one of the best movies ever, eh I wouldn't go that far but it is good.A good movie with some great scenes to takeaway."
31/12/2006,8,"Quentin Tarantino first stunned audiences with his amazing debut film RESERVOIR DOGS back in 1992. Two years later he repeated that feat on a grander scale with PULP FICTION, one of the greatest films ever made.It's extremely original and pure fun. Even the dialog is fun! There are tons of movies that came after it that tried to copy it, but none have succeeded. This is the real thing in all its glory. Highly recommend."
30/12/2006,8,"This film keeps the viewer paying attention as there is a lack of chronology in the telling of the narrative. However, this can be slightly troublesome during the first viewing of the film, but if one gives this movie the full attention it deserves, the characters (such as those played by Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and the watch scene with Christopher Walken) and dialogue drive narrative carry this film from the on-screen start to the end credits. The acting in this film is great, the use of the soundtrack paired with the film editing is even better, both of these paired together create a well-thought out, story that will continue to be told for some time. It's one of those ""cult classics"" for a reason. Not to mention, the director, Quentin Tarantino, what a talent."
15/12/2006,7,"Profanity, violence, and pop culture references abound in PULP FICTION, the new movie by Quentin Tarantino. Some may know Tarantino as the screenplay writer for TRUE ROMANCE or the writer-director of the critically acclaimed RESERVOIR DOGS, and just like those previous efforts the heart of PULP FICTION lies in Tarantino's brilliantly written conversations among the various characters. Dialogue fuels PULP FICTION to vividly show the contemptible lives of each character. Tarantino has the gift of propelling the movie along through the spoken word, whereas lesser creators might rely solely on action, violence or special effects. You should note that the movie is shown in a non-linear time structure reminiscent of the critically acclaimed independent film MYSTERY TRAIN, but this should not be an annoyance because the movie is basically a series of three related vignettes that individually add up to one great movie."
14/12/2006,7,"Pulp Fiction is such a personal matter of my heart. Quentin Tarantino is without a doubt one of the most talented directors today, these films may be too harsh for some, full of violence, blood and brutality, but brilliant for others. I belong to the second group. It's one of the few movies that made a really strong impression on me and its news, I think they became popular and I use it every day. Above all, I must praise the acting performance of John Travolta, who is indelibly etched in my memory as Vincent Vega. I don't even have to comment on the soundtrack, one of the best I've heard. When I talk about Pulp Fiction, all I can think about is the superlative itself and so that it doesn't mean anything. it does not take that it has become a real CULT."
10/12/2006,7,"Pulp Fiction (1994) by Quentin Tarantino is simple a one of the best classics out there. This crime/drama is absolutely terrific. The camera work is stunning, being a more modern movie. The acting was also superb.John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson absolutely rocked every scene they were in. Both names are big in Hollywood so it is expected that they steal the scenes they are in. The overall acting in this film truly blew me away, i was not expecting such a good performance out of this movie and I would recommend this movie to any of my friends as well as anyone who love classic crime movies."
28/11/2006,10,"Pulp Fiction, despite its high acclaim and position in the IMDb Top 250, only manages a 3/10 from my perspective. Initially promising, the film soon becomes a letdown, primarily due to its convoluted narrative structure and multiple intersecting storylines.The movie starts off strong, drawing the viewer in with its unique style and intriguing characters. However, as it progresses, the charm wears off. The multiple storylines, which at first seem clever, begin to tangle and create a confusing viewing experience. Instead of a cohesive narrative, the film feels disjointed, making it hard to follow and stay engaged.The constant jumping between different plots and timelines, while innovative, doesn't work for me. It disrupts the flow of the movie and dilutes the impact of each individual story. This narrative choice, though celebrated by many, can be disorienting and frustrating for viewers who prefer a more straightforward storytelling approach.In conclusion, while Pulp Fiction is renowned for its distinctive style and has a significant following, its complicated plot structure and lack of coherent narrative make it a rather tedious and overrated film in my book. The initial excitement quickly turns into disappointment, leading to the low rating."
23/11/2006,10,"Of course, in writing this entry I'm assuming that most of you have seen the movie Pulp Fiction, or at least know what it is. If you've never heard of Tarantino's 1994 masterpiece for some reason, I'd encourage you to give it a watch as soon as time permits. And when you do, think back on this entry and see if you can spot all forty-four uses of pop culture references in Pulp Fiction. Granted, it's not exactly a perfect movie (I'm looking at you, Smoky), but there's no denying its influence on pop culture today. It doesn't surprise me that Tarantino keeps coming up with memorable lines for his movies; after all, he got his start writing dialogue for video games. But I digress. If there's ever been a movie that heavily relies on dialogue and pop culture references to engage the audience, it's definitely Pulp Fiction. So if you do decide to watch it some time soon, be sure to look out for number forty-five."
20/11/2006,10,"""You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in Paris?"" It's inane, but it's entertaining and it sure seems witty when they're saying it, especially when you learn that this conversation is occurring on the way to knock off a group of possibly armed drug dealers. This is the casual manner in which you would like to talk with your friends and co-workers just before the big event goes down. This is dialogue that makes you feel hip just listening to it.Forget the salvation and redemption bit, this movie is all about making you feel hip. You feel hip when you get to listen in on the clever repartee, hip when you can be titillated by the gratuitous violence but still act blasé about it, hip when the sudden time jump doesn't bother you in the least. This movie makes you feel more hip then any other which has been made in quite a long time.Look beneath the hip surface, however, and you're left with little more than violence as entertainment. Violence in movies works best when used as a necessary device to support the plot, characters, and message. Tarantino reverses this relationship, creating plot and characters purely to support an entertaining sequence of violent situations. Each act of violence has its own specific purpose - make us laugh, make us jump, make us cheer, give us a vicarious thrill - and Tarantino is extremely skilled at making this work. This is the greatest strength of ""Pulp Fiction"", but ultimately its greatest weakness as well.The out-of-sequence scene demonstrates the extent to which the creation of entertaining violence was the driving force of the production. No doubt this was originally intended to be seen in its proper sequence but had to be removed because not only does it add nothing to the plot and character development, it actually bogs things down and gets in the way. Not wanting to lose his biggest laughs, however, Tarantino simply sticks it on the end and has the added bonus of now having a non-traditional narrative simple enough to not confuse his audience but sufficient to make them feel hip for being able to ""appreciate"" it.Is being hip enough? Not to be a classic, at least not in this case. Almost any hip movie is going to be firmly rooted in its own time period, but ""Pulp Fiction"" has lost it much more quickly than others. Although very entertaining and memorable in the initial viewing, its appeal fades quickly. When the hipness is gone, there's nothing left but violence, which doesn't make for a very pleasant viewing experience. Hip classics such as ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""Goldfinger"" stay classics because they still give us fun and adventure even after the hipness has turned to camp. ""Pulp Fiction"" just gets ugly with time. Guns, drugs, and a couple hillbillies right out of ""Deliverance"" aren't enough to make a classic film."
20/11/2006,10,"Pulp Fiction when viewed for what it is, is a great movie. But the man at the helm is not a great director. His ability to take every movie he's ever seen and amalgamate them into his own is magnificent. But ask yourself: Where is the real creativity? What has Quentin Tarantino contributed to cinema? Anyway, back to the movie: What makes Pulp Fiction (and Reservoir Dogs) such a great movie is a) the dialogue and b) the music and c) how it's all presented to us. Listening to someone talk about why they don't like bacon should not be interesting, but it is. This is QT's talent, the ability to make the mundane - cool. The movie references are refreshing to film buffs and the music is superb: another of QT's talents - knowing what song to play and when. Overall, Pulp Fiction IS a classic, I just don't like the director as a man."
07/10/2006,10,"Pulp Fiction is one of those rare great movies that if you closely follow the dialog you can appreciate it for what it really is, a fantastic movie with an ingenious dialog. With movies such as this where the film was directed and wrote (technincally co-wrote) by one man, it is bound to be compared to his/her other movies. Quentin Tarantino has both director and wrote 4 other movies (excluding My Best Friend's Birthday) and they are all fantastic, however this is in my opinion by far the best. Combined with a unique fantastic screenplay, great acting by all roles (expecially Samuel L. Jackson), and a creative intertwining of three different stories, makes Pulp Fiction a fantastic movie that is without a doubt my favorite of all time. Do yourself a favor, and see this movie."
14/09/2006,10,"This Movie is going to hit you. It's certain one of the best movies I've seen. The movie is so different, yet so typically Tarantino style. This movie is definitely way before it's time. This movie's greatest asset is the dialogue. Samuel L.Jackson and John Travolta make an excellent pair. This movie certainly has PULP. And most certainly has a lot of FICTION. All in all,only 1 word describes this movie - CLASS.Things to watch out for are :-1) Ezekiel 25:172) The Injection3) The Cop4) The Coffee Shop"
14/09/2006,10,"A I have stated in the title:
THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!The story, the actors, everything is where it should be.At the end, the story isn't counting anymore.All the actors are playing at their best.Not to mention that Quentin Tarantino is the best director of the movie world!Everything in the movie has dual character:
one that you observe at the first vision of the movie, and a deeper one at the second, third, Nth vision...
All of this being said (written) I am glad that I have watched the movie (at least 25 times - it is one of my favorite spending time possibilities ).As for a conclusion:
WATCH THE MOVIE!"
09/09/2006,10,"In my opinion, this film is Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece. It has the arguably smartest script I've ever seen; and its story is non-linear, making it hard to understand on first watch. Sam Jackson's performance asdrug lord Uncle Ruckus is one of the best I've ever seen. It would have been an Oscar winner if not for one problem: the movie isn't focused on any one specific thing. However, it has a subtle message of redemption as its main theme. Every segment entails its own personality, complements the overarching story, and connects to previous sections. The drama is moving and profound; the comedy is wacky and enjoyable. Each word of dialogue serves a purpose despite seeming unnecessary. I consider this film one of my all-time favorites. I find no fault with the movie and believe it to be completely flawless. Every person who loves classic films should see this movie; I don't think anyone can resist its charms."
28/08/2006,7,"I have seen this movie more than 15 times and still havent gotten tired of it. That is something, isn't it? Actually, I think, it is a great combination of great actors and great screenplay that makes the movie that good. Oh ... great music too! In short, this is my favorite one and I advise anyone to watch it too."
27/08/2006,7,"It is an exhilaration from beginning to end. It's the movie equivalent of that rare sort of novel where you find yourself checking to see how many pages are left and hoping there are more, not fewer. The first masterwork of the post-modern pop culture generation...gets better with every viewing, and like good rock n' roll, needs to be played loud. I think Quentin Tarantino is genius; his writing and directing were extraordinary, outstanding performances from all cast members, all made Pulp Fiction a classic masterpiece. One of the zaniest, funniest, smartest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. One of my all time favourites as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give terrific performances."
25/08/2006,7,"my favorite movie by far. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."
25/08/2006,7,"This movie is superb. It is definitely a move that you need to watch at least 2 or 3 times to fully appreciate, but every time will bring new experiences. There are so many small little things going on in the scenes, you miss many of them the first time through.Plus the movie changes it;s starting middle and ending a few times throughout the movie, so it can be confusing unless you know in advance what to expect.This all makes for a REALLY great movie, very imaginative, funny, and totally riveting from the first scene until the last.The casting could not have been more perfect and the actors all seemed to be having truly enjoyed making this film. It showed in their acting and in their enthusiasm to get their characters just right."
17/08/2006,6,"This film has everthing, in perfect balances - drama, humor, violence, wisdom, love; it has wonderful dialog and interesting characters. I can play this DVD 24 hours a day, the episodic nature of the movie is such that you can watch part of it one day then watch other parts at other times without feeling you missed key plot points.I wish every writer and director took the effort to carefully sculpt and craft every aspect of a movie like Tarantino does."
06/08/2006,7,"John Travolta & Samuel L. Jackson at their best.Four stories, one great film.The small time robbers (Tim Roth & Amanda Plummer), The gangsters (John Travolta & Samuel L. Jackson), The gangsters' wife (Uma Thurman), The boxer (Bruce Willis & Ving Rhames).In my opinion Quentin Tarantino's best film.You will need to watch this movie more than once to truly appreciate just how good it is. You will see something new each time you watch it.The dialogue is natural, convincing and witty. there are so many great characters in this film it difficult to pick any one. The main characters in all four stories give excellent performances but so do the supporting characters, such as the drug dealer and his girlfriend, The shop owner and police officer, Harvey Keitel as the Wolf, Christopher Walken as Captain Koons."
09/07/2006,9,"WARNING: EXCESSIVE FANBOY REVIEWBrilliance comes in many shapes and forms. This is Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, widely and rightfully hailed as a masterpiece by several people, and I happen to be amongst them. Whoever they are, they have good taste.It's tough to say what is so great about this, because there's practically a grocery list of things to choose from. Its idiosyncrasies are bold and pronounced, yet weaved perfectly into a story that is both funny and charming, never becoming stale and never missing a beat. The repertoire of actors on display here is certainly of a high pedigree (Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, etc.), and the way the stories are mixed and matched and jumbled up into the movie's steely exterior is done so masterfully that you don't even notice, blowing Crash and Memento (two films which I also lauded heavily, by the way) out of the water. Everything is perfectly in sync with the other stories and the way they come together is done so well that it gives me fits.I'd have to write a much longer review to detail every reason why this is so good, but that's unnecessary, and I'll keep it short: Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, and as the credits roll, either your perception of films (and sometimes life in general) will have changed, or you will be lost forever. Absolutely essential."
06/07/2006,9,"Pulp Fiction is a brilliant piece of cinema that tells the story of different characters whose lives are all interconnected. The film is told in a nonlinear narrative, and the characters are all incredibly unique and interesting. It also contains some of the most iconic and quotable moments in film history. The performances, cinematography, and editing are all top notch, and it's easy to see why it's considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time. Soundtrack is perfect. Acting is perfect too and this film contains one of the most iconic phrases in movie history and there's a lot of famous actors."
23/06/2006,9,"I have to say, first of all, I'm a movie freak.  I'm not in the right generation to have loved this movie from when it first came out, but I watched my first Tarantino movie with a friend, and it was Resevior Dogs of all things.  I admit that this man is a movie genious - the plotlines to both RD and PF are so awesome that they actually leave me thinking - unlike most movies.In both movies, plots are great, characters are great, actors are great, direction is great, and I can't seem to find anything wrong, at all, about either of these movies.  Throwing himself into the movie as a character, Tarantino's acting was awesome and I'd love to personally thank the man for this movie if I could.  I love the story intervention of Pulp Fiction - they all just connect and at the end of the movie you just go ""ahhhh! I get it!"". I love it.  I would suggest this movie to anyone who wants to see any talent in movies, and if the DVD wasn't due back tomorrow I'd watch this over and over and over.  I'm sure I'll buy it when I can conjure up the money because there is nothing I love more than a movie you can watch multiple times.I'd put this in my top three list, the other two movies being ""Resevior Dogs"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"".  I haven't even said anything about those, but they'd get better reviews than even this beast of a movie.  I love it, you should rent/buy it, because only a doofus can not like this movie. Watch it!  -TheVanillaNinja"
10/06/2006,9,"A good movie that is understandably seen as one of the greats. Well directed and written with some great performances and scenes. I mean... if it wasn't a movie by Tarantino it wouldn't have all this hype. One thing I love about this film is its originality and long, realistic dialogues."
27/05/2006,1,"Golly, everyone is falling all over themselves about this one.  Why, please? It's silly violent, nihilistic, pointless.  And every character has the same way of talking -- talking about clever things in that pseudo-way that only Quentin could possibly dream up.  Ooooooh, the talent! Pass."
17/05/2006,1,"I saw this movie on video, after hearing all sorts of movie critics praising Tarantino's masterful use of ""multiple narratives"" in this film.  I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of ""Rashomon,"" which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the ""banality of evil, but the ""hard-boiled"" dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence. As for the multiple story line concept, it's wasted here.  Tarantino actually did a better job with interweaving multiple story lines in ""Reservoir Dogs"" (another flawed film, but for different reasons).  And regarding what's in the briefcase--ultimately, who cares?"
15/05/2006,1,"Perhaps the greatest movie ever made.This is Why:Pulp Fiction has the funniest and coolest dialogues and scenes with the most perfect actors of any movie that I have seen so far in my life.Tarantino creates the most hilarious situations. Examples: the toaster scene - my favourite scene without any words..., that scene is incredible. Another one: Butch and Marsellus meet coincidentally at the traffic light. And everything that follows. Unmatched. Another one: the gimp scene. This is perhaps the best scene of the movie. I was on my knees laughing when they raped Marsellus and he was about to think about revenge. .If you don't get the coolness and fun and the perfect story on the 1st watch, give it another try anytime later on. It is mostly about the scenes and the atmosphere and these hilarious situations.But the story is perfect as well. Some ask: What's in the suitcase? It doesn't matter! All that mattered: It is something really valuable. That is the only thing that matters. It doesn't matter If it's money, drugs or jewels or anything else. It is something they kill for. That is what matters."
23/04/2006,5,"Pulp Fiction' scores extra stars for setting up an original way of story-telling. The story is told from end to beginning (well, sort of), and it follows a few characters who get caught up in some misunderstanding or mess involving crime or criminal. Thoroughly engaging but often warped and funny, this film is a pleasure to watch. In the final scenes, the viewer learns how the different stories of the characters are connected, bringing an even closer meaning to the film. 'Pulp Fiction' is very creative in its story-telling method. That is what makes this a good film, and without it, this film would be dull and like any other film."
21/04/2006,5,"While I don't think its better than Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction certainly comes close. PF is definitley one of the 5 best movies of the 1990s and established Tarantino as an accomplished filmmaker. Everyone knows the screenplay, acting, and direction are top notch, so I won't get into that. Bottom Line: Classic film that everyone should see. 10/10"
20/04/2006,5,"It has action, humor, tension and plenty of drama. In addition, lots of cool, off-beat dialogue. Unfortunately, the almost non-stop foul language takes away some of the power and enjoyment. One great thing about this type of movie is the intentionally unintentional humor out of genuinely bizarre situation. Some may find the scene of Jimmie in the kitchen hilarious, but I feel it's ruined by the over-acting of Tarantino and the expletive-filled rant which sounded forced and fabricated, losing the edge of unintentional humor and genuinely bizarre situation. Luckily, the scene of Jules in the diner with Ringo and Yolanda had very little foul language, but it's the most powerful scene. There are other places where few or no expletive could make the humor and/or drama just as gripping if not more so. Overall, a 7 out of 10."
11/04/2006,4,"The first gangster film to make inane yet paralyzing dialog the star of the movie. Brilliant and engaging, endlessly quotable and visually alluring, PF made all the top lists, regenerated John Travolta, solidified Bruce Willis, centered Samuel L. Jackson as a leading man and cemented Christopher Walken among creepiest of cameos ever. The side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest. They discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner.... and we actually see very little violence play out! Tarantino's use of the chopped up time line only added to the Pulp mystique as well as it's charm. Imbecile gangsters charming? Regressive American social interaction cinema worthy? When combined , it remains a perfect storm for Quintin & company."
23/03/2006,1,"This is one of those movies no matter how much times passes, it is still fantastic from beginning to end!The characters, story lines, music, it all just worked. A+ to this day"
17/03/2006,1,"Quentin Tarantino demonstrated to the world the powerful ingenuity he possesses, and of which he boasts in every minute of this one, his best film, of 2 and a half hours of duration. The real magic of the film is that its viewing is short and leaves you wanting even more, despite its length. Another particularly attractive aspect is its black humour and ordinary situations.
Everything is incredible in Pulp Fiction, but without a doubt the most charismatic thing of all is its script, dividing the facts into chapters that were later imitated in other films by other directors and repeated with other films such as ""Kill Bill"". These chapters are not even exposed in a chronological order, which forces the viewer to fit the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe.
The next strong point is the very famous cast with brilliant performances that raise the quality of the film to unattainable levels. In particular I want to express my admiration for John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in their roles as thugs/collectors (Vincent Vega and Jules, respectively) with unforgettable dialogues and discussions that are present almost at all times in their joint performance.
Another ingredient magnificently introduced is his soundtrack, with great themes, besides the mythical title song, including pop, rock and soul themes (I find especially elegant Travolta's dance song with Uma Thurman, by Chuck Berry).
In short, I can only say that I find no fault with this film and that I do not bring anything new that anyone already knows about this work. Unless Tarantino does something of this magnitude again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time10/10"
13/02/2006,8,"The movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino and is considered to be a turn in the history of Hollywood cinema. It was released on 14th October 1995 and maintains its position #5 in IMDb's top 250 list ever since. The great thing about this movie is the its non-linear storyline which keeps the audience interested. It revolves around the lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.. The thing that most amused me is long duration continuous shots and the brilliant acting done by Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman. This movie has some great all time favorite dialog like ""I dare you, I double dare you"" and many more. The music in the movie is great as it very well keeps the pace and rhythm of the movie and keeps viewers interested.Coming to the composition of the movie, the sudden movement of space and time is very well composed and directed. The movie starts from present, goes into the past, then jumps to future and comes back to the present. This is very well crafted so that the audience do not get confused.Coming to awards and nominations, it won an Oscar for the best writing and screenplay and got numerous nominations for best picture, best actor, best actor in the supporting role, best director and many more. Overall it won 62 awards and 46 nominations and an Oscar which is a sign of great movie.So I would like to conclude by saying that it is indeed a great movie to watch with good plot,acting and direction and one should watch it at least once."
30/01/2006,8,"I think I agree with all the reviews that have come before me.  (Not the ridiculously negative).  Though, this movie does have it's good points (great points); and some that aren't so good - i.e. drug use, violence, blatant disregard for human life and the lack of hardly any morals (on the part of MOST characters).  I've got to say, though, I loved this movie (""love"" is a strong word, considering some of the content listed above). Nevertheless, everything about the way this movie was created was masterpiece material.  Bold and daring variation from mainstream plot.  A look at the ""normal"" aspect of the lives of hanous characters - i.e. what they did or dislike, what and how they like to smoke.  Their feelings on pop culture icons and the list goes on.  Personally, I find that viewpoint fascinating.What worked:  Particularly, the absence of pretense in the actors' projection of their characters; I found myself actually believing that John Travolta was a heroin-abusing, cold-blooded assassin.  Each actor made their character real; and that says a lot about Terantino, as well.  He knew what he wanted from these artists and drew it from them; even when they didn't necessarily endorse the character's behaviors.  PLUS, I think writer/director Terantino portrayed the opposite of mainstream opinion. Some would say that his story glorified or encouraged these criminal actions.  ON THE CONTRARY, I believe he showed that bad things are more likely to happen to people who don't have a good moral fiber.  And, sad though true, these characters are, in any case, a reality of sorts in the world, today.What didn't work:  Not so much that anything didn't work, but that the content was too dark.  AND only for the reason that this was my dad's kind of movie, and one kids could learn from.  Though, from the content neither will watch (well not my kids).  My dad likes crime dramas, but he comes from an era where movies criminals don't swear or not much, anyway.  On the same token, weren't ever portrayed using mind-altering substances.  Other than this, I think he would love this movie.  Maybe he'll just have to catch the edited for television version - ha ha ha.  For me, though, I liked it just fine.9/10 - Hell, I've gotta save a perfect score for that might have the same impact, but my kids could watch, too.  Maybe not possible.  Other than that, I loved this film.thank you"
28/01/2006,8,"I thought Vincent, who fell in love with the restroom, was the protagonist. He once pointed a gun at someone and was pointed at again, but he never thought he would die; I thought Mia, who was a flirtatious person, would have sex with Vincent, but I didn't expect to experience shock from a drug overdose, let alone be able to save her life; I thought Jules, who loves to recite the Bible, would be ruthless to the end, but I didn't expect to kill and release someone after reading the Bible twice; I thought Butch, who was always awakened by nightmares, would die at home or in a guitar store after Deser retrieved his watch, but he actually killed everyone; I thought Marsellus, the boss who controlled everything, would laugh until the end, but I didn't expect that the moment when the green hat was pushed open the door was not only a psychological shadow of Marsellus, but also a shadow of my heart; I thought Pumpking and Honey Bunny, who were determined not to work, would be like male and female thieves, but I didn't expect they were just a pair of fools. Why is everyone's ending different from what I thought??!!!!!"
18/01/2006,8,"Pulp Fiction is ridiculously cool. Filled with cool characters and cool dialogue, it is truly epic and lives up to its reputation. I have never seen a film anything like this, with no consistent plot and no one objective, it is easy to view this film as a messy one, but I would say the opposite. It is a film that contradicts all the norms of Hollywood, and focuses solely on intricate and detailed moments of characters. We don't get back story, we don't get explanations. All we get is scene after seen of pure entertainment, excitement and comedy. Tarantino is an absolute genius to have created this, it is a film that you can never tire of. All of the actors give outstanding performances, even Tim Roth and Christopher Walken who barely appear, but manage to make a mark. Samuel l Jackson is so good as Jules and so funny, and Uma Thurman is mesmerising. I can see why this won best original screenplay, as the dialogue is absolutely spot on! This film has a profound spot in cinema history, a place truly deserved!"
17/01/2006,8,"This movie is just the best there is. It is one of, if not, my favorite film of all time. It is easily Tarantino's best, not only because of his great style and visible love of movies, made evidence in this film, or for his pop culture icons plastered throughout his films. It isn't great because of only one of these things, but they all contribute to the quirkiness and coolness of the film. Not one moment of the film is wasted, everything contributes to it. The silences and pauses are just perfect, the dialogue is just long enough to make you think about how much time is being spent on a certain conversation, but not too long as to seem to try too hard, like so many other films have since Pulp Fiction. This movie is far from an action movie, and it is not a comedy, despite it being quite hilarious throughout. It is a twisted, unorthodox, and overall wonderfully directed and edited piece of filmaking that makes great use of its seemingly trivial parts as almost the main focus of the film, and uses these things to enhance the characters and the storyline. Each character gets his or her time to shine without it seeming like the film is making room for this, as Tarantino just tells each one's story in his amazing way, taking all of his perfectly orchestrated pieces, and putting them all together in the end..."
17/01/2006,8,"I initially saw this movie because there was alot of talk and press at the time the movie came out. It brought back Travolta's career. Look at the load of movies he pulled out in the 90's after this. And it put Samuel on the map for good. It also acknowledged other underrated great actors.This isn't my favorite movie and I would never have to see it again. It was very disturbing to watch but very real. This movie also went against Hollywood's usual conduct of restraint. This movie had no restraints.I can't even give a summation of the story, but I applaud Q. Taratino for his artistic merit. He is very innovative and different. This movie was based on content, originality and style. I personally thought his best work was True Romance, From Dusk till Dawn, and Resorvoir Dogs. The key is in the script writing. He focuses on real characters with real dialogue. Not the cheesy kind and isn't afraid to touch racial/social differences that may be offensive. I truly think he is one of a kind and Pulp Fiction proved that."
14/01/2006,8,"Today revisited what is among the very greatest films of the 1990's. Quentin Tarantino confirmed that Reservoir Dogs was no fuke by upping his game further here. The script is brilliant, the direction is creative and inventive. The acting by a large cast is perfection. It's a shame than Samuel L. Jackson lost the Oscar for this, though the winner was worthy as well, but this is his finest screen appearance in a long career. I've never been a fan of John Travolta and I'm still not, but he won me over here in the performance of his life. One cannot get into all of the cast as it is stocked with many major talents who all shine. It's original to say the least, it's smart, it's funny, it's tense, you name it. This is a great piece of filmmaking."
18/12/2005,7,"Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take ""screenwriting"" classes that teach them the formulas for ""hit films."" Like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and ""Official Detective,"" the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom."
14/12/2005,7,"I watched Pulp Fiction and I thought it was great; I was really happy during the entire movie. The whole cast did a nice job. That's probably Tarantino's best work, he's good!"
03/12/2005,8,"This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has comedy, suspense, action, everything you could want in a movie. This movie is brilliant! It may be the single best movie ever This movie has the best casts assembled ever from Samuel L. Jackson to John Travolta to Bruce Willis. Then how viewers are taken through a journey of 3 stories that all intertwine together. Nothing is predictable through the movie like most movies are. Quentin Tarantino is an directs this movie amazingly. This movie is a all-time classic that you could watch 100 times and never get bored of it. The first time I watched it I watched it about 10 more times right after that because it was so good."
26/11/2005,10,"What to say first, for a movie that has changed the way I see the 7th art.It was 1994 when my parents went home from the premiere our home town's municipality has made. ""Don't watch this sick film"", said my mother. ""yes, listen to your mother and don't watch this sick film"", my father agreed.As a typical 17 year old, this was the best thing they could do to make me watch it. I still act like that, but at that age, it was just the thing.Well, and and it blew me away. I won't be lieing, the extreme scenes of sodomy and killings that are on this film it's not what makes me like it.In the contrary, that scenes is exactly not the point. The point is the de-synced plot and the excellent performances, lines and pictures, on a movie that reached so many people.It was not the first time, a movie was violent. It was not the first time, a movie had excellent performances, music, direction or even de-synced timing on the plot.But it was the first time a movie took all these elements and made,a masterpiece."

25/11/2005,10,"I wasnt entertained at all by it .it seemed a very boring and incoherent movie to me. Thanks God this movie ended.it was a very boring experience and i regret that many of the top movies on IMDB list are of gangsters,guns and bullets.it gives a glimpse of american and western culture from the inside and gives the idea what people in the west and America really appreciate in taste. I have seen top 8 movies on this list now and 12 Angry Men and Schindler's list have only impressed me so far. May be i dont have some guns and bullets background or what but i always fail to appreciate such movies.."
18/11/2005,10,"I love all of Tarantino's films. Pulp Fiction has the right mix of comedy,dialogue,and violence that I have never seen. This film is only behind Kill Bill Vol.2 on my favorites list and it has changed the way I view film. I am glad that I heard about this film and decided to watch it one day. The great performances in the film will live on forever. This film will never be matched and the genius of Tarantino indelibly etched into history. I will always be watching for his next great hit because Tarantino always keeps you at the edge of your seat. The engrossing stories he comes up with always keep me excited. I always watch them when they come on and I never get bored. I do not know if I can say that with any other movies."
17/11/2005,10,"You can't compare this movie to any other. The three stories which are wrapped in one, are all perfectly made, really funny and violent. Tarantino did a great job! I liked the great dialog the most, especially from Rhames (character Marsellus Wallace) and Jackson (character Jules Winnfield). But the best performance is from John Travolta, who plays the gangster Vincent Vega. The whole attitude of this character is very real and interesting. The whole movie is about 145 minutes long, but I stayed entertained all the way! One of the greatest movies ever!!"
29/10/2005,10,"Blood and violence does not make up for horrible acting, bad plot, and ridiculous ""slap-stick"" comedy. It amazes me that so many brain dead Americans found this ""movie"" enlightening. I can not see why. I originally saw Pulp Fiction in the theater and was thrown-a-back, not because I was moved by it's greatness, but because I vomited all over the theater. I recently gave it another shot and ended up vomiting all over my family room. If any of you want to see a good movie that has great violence and great acting/plot, check out Se7en, or Fight Club, or The Boondock Saints, or The Way of the Gun. I suggest to all ... STAY AWAY from QUENTIN TORRENTINO and check out movies written/directed by David Fincher or Christopher McQuarrie. They are two of the best movie makers that have appeared in the last 20 years. Torrentino is a hack who steals all his ideas from Indy, low-budget 1970's films (mostly crappy Asian films) and makes millions of dollars pawning his regurgitated crap back to his loyal, if not brain-dead, fan base."
26/10/2005,10,"It's interesting to read statistics such as "" The word 'f_' was used 463,729 times in this film."" Apparently Quentin Tarantino needs to know how many quarters to put in his cuss jar.Movies are made to take the place of storytellers, and when we sit adoringly at Hollywood's knee we expect something fabulous. Not everyone can spin a good yarn, and now we know that even our most promising film makers, regardless of their inauspicious beginnings, cannot hold our attention without resorting to gore and gimmickry. Films like ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino; starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman and many other big names) leave me wondering if prominent producers have just flat lost touch with their audiences.Parents and grandparents must also consider the larger view: If a little pitcher accidentally stumbles into the wrong warren at the neighborhood multiplex his big ears will hear fascinating new words that might cause him to stay for a second listen, but by the end of this loud, red film he'll be ready for the booby hatch. I worry. When Hollywood dumps buckets of blood like this on to the silver screen I'm always afraid youngsters might see it. Heck, I'm not sure anyone should see it.I am disappointed in myself for falling for the fast talk and slickness (ignored the wee-small voice again). I watched the whole thing, and now my only hope for personal redemption is to try to prevent people with taste from having anything to do with this self-indulgent free-for-all. If I were Catholic I'd probably have to go to Confession just for having sat through this mayhem. Public forums are an excellent way for us film fans to inform these talented and powerful people that we crave clever stories told in creative ways, and that profanity and blood are best served sparingly.It is possible that Quentin Tarantino is a genius. My hope is that his future work will be full and inspired, and that he will begin to move toward the light. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a dazzling display of drugs, death and depravity, and I advise you to see it at your own risk.Maureen Adele ComptonPost script: I can't be the only person who thinks it's getting worse. They're using curse words now that even people who do swear wouldn't have dreamed of using in public. I will admit saying ""Aitch-eeee-double-toothpicks"" is cumbersome, and probably wouldn't 'read' well. Having said all that, I could probably stand it if they would just stop using one phrase in particular. You know the one I mean. Say it now, pay for it later. Amen."
21/10/2005,10,"Well what can I say?This film is by far the best Tarantino film! First of all because it is one on its on I mean can you honestly put this film into a genre? It has elements of comedy, horror, action, thriller I could go on for ever! I was never into films until about three years ago and had to study an auteur so I picked Tarantino and I am sooo glad after I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time I thought whats all the fuss about but after watching it a second time I realised what all the critics were on about its fantastic one of the best film to come out of America in a long while and I suspect it will be a couple more years before a legend such as Quentin will appear on our screens once again!"
21/09/2005,10,"Pulp fiction is the best movie ever made.  From start to finish, I was glued to the edge of my seat...all 2.5 hours of it...John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, and cannot forget Bruce Willis, all had tremendously excellent performances.  Travolta and Jackson playing Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, two mobster assassins who work for Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames.  Uma Thurman plays Mia Wallace, Marsellus' wife, and Bruce Willis plays Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter who was supposed to throw a fight but actually ended up winning, and now he's trying to get away from Marsellus.  Ok, I don't want to say anything else.....just watch the damn movie, it's that good...it's that great....it's that awesome...Before last night, i haven't even seen Pulp Fiction but then I decided to buy the Collector's Edition dvd that's truly awesome.  Trust me....You will not see a better movie in your lifetime.  And as for Pulp being ranked at #20 on IMDB is garbage.  It should at least be in the top 5...ohh wait...forget top 5...it should be #1.  Godfather is a great movie that really has it's moments but it does get dull in many parts.....I truly recommend that you see this movie...you will not be disappointed100,000,000,000,000/10"
16/09/2005,10,"When it comes to original movies, then ""Pulp Fiction"" is definitely one to mention. The 1994 film established the popularity not only of Quentin Tarantino, but also of many actors who appear in the film.The writing is brilliant. The entire story of the film is well structured, full of fantastic and iconic moments.The direction is fantastic. Along with the writing, it is one of the film's greatest achievements.The acting is amazing! John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis... and even the director/writer himself has a cameo in his film.In summary, a classic, superbly made film that does contain a fair amount of brutality, but don't let that put you off, it's absolutely worth watching."
06/09/2005,10,"I love this movie, it is a perfect mixture of crime, joke and wisdoms (Quarterpounder = Royal Cheese).Since today I have seen this film a dozen times. Can't belief that this film is over 20 years old! In my opinion this is the best Tarantino movie.Every time I can recognize new things. I love the para-language from John Travolta and the black humor from Samuel L Jackson.This movie has three different stories (Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace Wife, golden watch and Bonnie situation) with no time chronology. Since today I have no idea what is in the suitcase ;-)."
22/08/2005,6,"Not only a brilliant script, with incredible characters brought together over one CRAZY Boxing match that takes us through the World that only Quentin could guide us through.Nothing says Koontz Better than Walken, nohing says Muthafucha better than Ving and Nothing....No one, can ever TOP the POWER of Jackson's over Kill Bad ass Jules!"
19/08/2005,6,"Finally got around to watching this almost 30 years on. And it feels very out of date. Some set scenes are quite good, & there's a bit of humour. But on the whole it just screams self-indulgence. Topped off with Tarantino stepping in front of the camera. Ploddingly slow too often in an attempt to be arty and edgy, it just exposes the poor writing that the shifted timelines can't save. No investment in characters, or plot. Just a collection of scenes and ideas drowning in a lake of stagnant dialogue and overly long, trite scenes with characters and actions that make no sense. Very disappointing."
13/08/2005,6,"Black comedy told through the framework of the omnibus, ""Pulp Fiction"" is without any doubt one of the best and most important films of all time, a masterpiece that has its aesthetics, juicy dialogue and unpredictable acting division greatly influenced by the explosion of the so-called indie cinema in the mid-nineties. we have four weakly related stories in a linear jumps. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino kind of wanted to emphasize that the most important thing in every movie is the story and the dialogue, but also to raw material itself without the original prescription can not provide anything more valuable than short-term fun. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of the titles that we never get bored."
08/08/2005,7,"Pulp Fiction (1994) Starring: John Travolta, Samuel L.

When I went to a Film Production class I eventually dropped out of, the professor and a classmate where like how can you want to be a film critic and have not seen Pulp Fiction and would always ask me you seen Pulp Fiction yet everyday. Pulp Fiction is set in the early ninety's and tells three stories of characters played by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis to name a few. As the film started I didn't get it but as we went through the first two stories I started to get the gist of it. If it weren't the first few weeks I was in that class I wouldn't have noticed the shots in the second story where John Travolta and Uma Thurman sitting down in the diner how the shots are equivalent to each other and don't change too often. The films a product of the nineties with its music but my favorite scenes is those silent moments like in the diner or in the last story where a man in the bathroom comes out starts shooting at Vincent(John Travolta) and Jules(Samuel L. Jackson) and it stops they look and you know whats bout to happen. I love how all the stories leave on a note like whatever happen to these two or whats going to go on next, it doesn't just give you an answer. Pulp Fiction is one of the great giant achievements in filmaking and in film history and I can see why. The stories are fun to sit through and all the shots from director and star Quentin Tarantino are amazing and the cast is very memorable."
01/08/2005,6,This movie is the best that ever has been made.John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson are outstanding and Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors in the world.I also think that this movie should have won the academy award.Everything in this movie is great.I´ve seen it about 20 times and it gets better and better every time.
20/07/2005,9,"Genius! Pure genius, is what this film is! Though INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, DJANGO UNCHAINED and JACKIE BROWN are among my favourite QT movies, none of Tarantino's other work is quite as much fun, as inventive or as darn quotable as PULP FICTION! It's a true 'cult movie' of the highest order, and a true, movie, gem from the 90s!Never has Tarantino's dialogue been so juicy, his story so much fun or his characters so iconic (apart from Mr. Blonde or Hans Landa, of course!). There's just so much to enjoy from this movie as Tarantino pulls together one his best casts including Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman and unforgettably, Samuel L. Jackson! Tarantino also crafts one of the best soudntracks in cinematic history; using some of the greats like Al Green, Dusty Springfield, and Chuck Berry's ""You Never Can Tell"" in the so-bad-that-it's-good dance sequence (which I intend to dance with my future wife at our wedding someday)!Every scene is laced with killer, totally quotable dialogue and who here, isn't aware by now, that a Quater Pounder with Cheese in France, is called ""Royale With Cheese""? It's probably (save INGLOURIOUS and DJANGO) Tarantino's best script, with the dynamite dialogue and brilliant, yet baffling use of the non-linnear storyline. Never have Tarantino's storylines ever captured the imagination in such an explosive way as we follow two hit men, a mobster's wife, a boxer and a pair of diner-robbing, adrenaline junkies!I'm not saying it's perfect; there's stuff you'll hate, there's stuff that will shock you and there's stuff that will disgust you as the film deals with the illegal, criminal, underworld of Los Angeles. As iconic as it was, being a Christian, I was not entirely comfourtable with Tarantino's version of the Bible verse from Ezekiel but on a whole, I found myself moved by Jules Winnfield's (Samuel L. Jackson's) tale of redemption as the hitman who has a dramatic change of heart since it shows that even a hired killer, is not without soul or humanity.Like I said, this film is about crime but the real crime is that Samuel L. Jackson didn't get an Oscar for his role! He is frankly masterful as he lyrically waxes about burgers, pigs and moral codes. He's BY FAR, the best part of the film and is able to appear comical and terrifying at the same time.Every factor of this film fits together perfectly and to paraphrase from INGLOURIOUS: ""I Think This Just Might Be Tarantino's Masterpiece!"""
17/07/2005,9,"The movie is more than wonderful and I did not get tired of watching it.I can watch it once, twice and more than once.Usually I only watch the movie once, but this movie I can watch more than once."
07/06/2005,9,"What's to say about this movie that hasn't already been said? This is the best example in cinema history of character building and fantastic dialogue. You have to give credit to the genius that is Quentin Tarantino when he can take a relatively uneventful and straight forward narrative and pull it out of order and craft amazing characters in order to make it one of the best movies of all time. So quotable, so well acted, so iconic, truly one of the best scripts put to film!"
06/06/2005,9,"Film is still a must see. The construction, the flashbacks and forwards, the dialogues, the camera position and the music are still one of the best. I'm a business man, I had similar dialogues on my day-to-day business. Not on the same topic, but similar. The way you talk about your travels, people you meet, sex, food, ... The scene when Vincent and Jules wait in front of the door because is too early, I did many times before visiting a customer (sure with different intentions). I always wonder what this ""bad"" people talk about, and found same fears and interest like me. My only concern, and that's the reason not to give a higher score is too drug related. Honestly I can handle the violence, but not the drug. Yes, I know it's the same, and probably it's a personal fear, but I found really disgusting the scene where Vincent takes the heroin."
27/05/2005,1,"This is arguably one of the most influential films of all time. Story-telling with totally entertaining dialogue with teasing subtext. If you're a film student, this is a must-watch. Some movies, as great as they are, once you're done watching, you know, you would never want to watch them again. Pulp fiction gets better with each screening as you discover more layers in the story."
21/05/2005,1,"Pulp Fiction is to be seen to be believed, it was big, it was brash, it certainly arrived with a bang.One of the most stylish films ever made, Quentin Tarantino delivered something that viewers had been starved of for so many years, Pulp Fiction offered wondering very keen, like a new voice.Le Big Mac, that scene where Jules and Vincent are rambling on about McDonalds, just before doing a hit, that's one of.my favourite moments, the iconic moment though, Vincent and Mia dancing, it has to be one of the greatest movie scenes of all time, Chuck Berry, a scene I repeat and repeat, it's sublime.I'm not even sure if I like the storyline or not, it's maybe a little trashy, it just doesn't matter somehow, the film's good points are turbocharged enough to hide over any cracks. It's wonderfully violent, incredibly well paced, and full of action.Astonishing cast, Travolta at his best, Jackson, Thurman, Keitel, Roth, Willis, the names are endless, brilliant.The music, the music is just astonishing, it's what ears were designed for, you'll watch this and you'll be reaching for the soundtrack.What cinema was made for 10/10."
20/05/2005,1,"This is what I call a fad movie.  People say it is a great movie because other people said it is great.  People are afraid to express their true feelings because they don't want to be ridiculed by their friends, especially if one is a member of the so-called X-generation.  I would imagine that the number of people who rented the video or saw it on cable that stopped watching the movie because it was so bad is fairly high, especially for a movie that is considered a great movie.However, I concede that a number of people truly like it.  However, I find that there are just as many people who are repulsed by this movie.  They just don't express their feelings in this type of format because a bad movie isn't worth the effort of making a negative opinion."
19/05/2005,1,"Pulp Fiction is a good, well-acted movie that is way, way, way over hyped by its fans. The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond?  Yeah, sure it was cool at the time but that coolness quickly wears off when you realize there is really nothing likeable about any of these people."
15/05/2005,1,"The hit-men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) work for the powerful mobster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that God's hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the winner and weakest ""Forrest Gump"") with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. ""Pump Fiction"" saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult ""Reservoir Dogs"". The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Pulp Fiction – Tempo de Violência"" (""Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence"")"
12/05/2005,1,"What can I say? This film is amazing, and I would go further and say it is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
04/05/2005,1,"Pulp fiction is one of the most revolutionary films in the industry. It is funny, chaotic and entertaining. The film itself never tried to play it cool. And that is what makes it so captivating; its unwillingness to look cool and deep(like every Tarantino film) charms every viewer. Pulp fiction compaired to every other film of the industry probably looks like that one girl in the club that you will never see again but you will likely keep fantasizing of forever;She is totally indifferent and bored, effortlessly cool and gives the best laughs. Wait... Mia Wallace, is that you???"
04/05/2005,1,"I saw this film last year when my dad recommend it to me, and I was not disappointed even though it was made before I was born. The idea of having several different people's lives meet at the end is not original, but it is cleverly done and it pays off. The characters have a variety of personalities and it keeps you on your feet. A must watch!"
03/05/2005,1,"Pulp Fiction is pretty much Once upon a time in Hollywood, but better in every regard.Pulp Fiction encapsulated and defined the 90s, that's what this movie was. A piece of art, not a movie.This movie is all about the characters and the actors, not any plot. That's why I would rate the movie as follows1. Characters 112. Acting 103. Plot 74. Cinematography 105. World building 10We have stellar characters and acting. Cinematography is also amazing, it really sucks you in and the world building really makes you fell like you are in the 90s."
29/04/2005,5,"I still remember watching this movie when it first came out in theaters. I couldn't believe what I just saw. My friends and I would go back at least a dozen more times es to watch this in the theater. It became my ll time favorite movie to 5is very day. Anytime the movie would come on TV or HBO or any channel over the years I would have to watch it again. I can safely say I be seen this movie well over 250 times and it never gets old. What Tarantino accomplished here is cinematic masterpiece by its very The Godfather, Goid Fellas and there's Pulp Fiction. That's it. That's the list. Every other movie, no matter how good, comes after the big 3."
27/04/2005,5,"I love the movies; have seen many many movies during my half century on this planet. However, there is only one movie that I ever paid good money for and felt compelled to walk out. That film is PULP FICTION. I hadn't seen John Travolta in a film for several years and was looking forward to seeing him again. THe advertising poster looked nice but when the movie started, i was immediately turned off. I waited for it to get better; waited for the storyline to begin to take shape. However, during the first 45 minutes, i witnessed film footage that was difficult (to put it mildly) to watch. At minute 46, I gave up and decided I could no longer watch this trash and walked out. The film stinks. It was awful, it was terrible, it was disgusting."
21/04/2005,5,"**I really don't understand why this movie got 9 Rating on IMDb.**I think this can be put in the list of worst movies ever made. **No plot, no sense. what was that ? **i""m still thinking. PULP Fiction is clearly the most overrated movie. People are describibg this movie as best movie ever made uh! seriously, what they saw in this sh@t."
19/04/2005,5,"The movie pulp fiction is the best movie i have watched till now in my whole life.It it an all rounder as it includes extreme drug use,mild sexual content,mild humour & intense violence. I say that most of 18+ teens would certainly like.The movie, which was a surprise Grand Prize-winner at the last Cannes Film Festival, is shockingly violent, provocatively obscene and profane. It won't just offend some audiences; it will offend the living hell out of them. Tarantino intends to rile people up.After the boxer story plays out, we slide back in time to the previous day, when we learn why the hit men showed up in strange college-guy clothes. It's because after the first hit, they took one of their spies home with them. While gesturing dramatically with a gun, Travolta learns why the first rule of gun safety is never point a gun at something you are not willing to destroy. The gun, as guns do, goes bang; the young man, as young men do when hit by bullets, goes ker-blooie. Thus follows a bizarre adventure in post-shooting hygiene, in which the two hit men, a suburban buddy (played by Tarantino himself) and an elegantly mysterious fixer (Harvey Keitel) deal with the problem of scrambled brains all over the upholstery."
09/04/2005,6,"Certainly worth a watch, but this movie didn't reinvent the wheel like a lot of fans would have you believe. Like most Tarantino films it's self indulgent to the point that it divides viewers into camps of those who think it's genius, and those who remembered they had some paint drying somewhere they needed to check on.Oddly enough I fall into the camp that's somewhere in-between with this title."
04/04/2005,6,"Quick disclaimer, I am 24 and have generally not seen tons of 90's movies. I read somewhere that this film is a landmark of modern cinema and has influenced many other gangster flicks after it. That certainly makes sense, has a unusual plot line(if you can call it that) for it's time, has grotesque violence and obviously not taking itself too seriously.Moreover, no subject matter, to me it felt the scenes were purposely constructed to give off artsy notion and not develop the story. It seemed like ''art made for the sake of making art'' which is pretentious in my eyes, however many people obviously find it riveting.There is this sequence of scenes which is so completely out of left field that will most likely make you feel emotionally disturbed (don't want to spoil it). Again, it is completely random, however made me chuckle. You can't help but admire Tarantino's audacity to put the most shocking things in front of the eyes of millions. Did not like him as an actor though, the incoherent digressions were a bit too much at a certain point.If you are expecting something meaningful, skip this one. It definetely leaves you with sense of emptiness when over. The thought ""What on earth did I just watch'' was swirling in my head for some time after. Don't think I would consider rewatching it."
02/04/2005,5,"Three Stories told out of order with various characters appears before or after things do happen. This audacious, outrageous look at honor among lowlifes. This separate stories are told in a somewhat radical style.The films opens with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth), who spontaneously decide to hold up a restaurant. Vicent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) work as Hit-man for Crime Boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), Vincent and Jules are on the hunt for a briefcase whose contents were stoles from their boss. Later that day... Vincent takes the Crime Boss Wife's (Uma Thruman) for a night in the town. Things goes well until one of them makes a huge mistake. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is a crooked boxer who's been asked by the Crime Boss to throw his latest fight. But Butch ended up accidentally killed the other boxer. Then the film's takes us back to Vicent and Jules as they run into a few unexpected detours among the way. Then they meet Honey Bunny Pumpkin at the restaurant. Which Vincent and Jules only wanted peaceful breakfast. Jules ended up talking some sense to Honey Bunny and Pumpkin about life and the bible.Directed by Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill Vol.1 & Vol.2, Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs) made an sharp, funny, wildly entertaining film. This film has incredible memorable dialogue and an cast of familiar faces like Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel and Peter Greene. This film was one of the biggest hits of 1994 and the film has a terrific soundtrack.This was one of the most critically acclaimed film of 1994. Audiences loves this film also. The film received Oscar-Nominations for Best Actor:John Travolta, Best Supporting Actor:Samuel L. Jackson, Best Supporting Actress:Uma Thurman, Best Editing:Sally Menke, Best Picture:Lawrence Bender and Best Director:Quentin Tarantino. The film Won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay by the director:Tarantino and Filmmaker:Roger Avary (Killing Zoe, Mr. Stitch, The Rules of Attraction). This is a extremely violent, pumped up film with dark humor isn't for everyone but it is one of the smartest films out-there. Watch for Steve Buscemi, Kathy Griffin and a funny bit role by the director in the third tale. One of the Executive Producers is Actor:Danny De Vito. Panavision. (**** ½/*****)."
30/03/2005,1,Now thats a re-a-l scary funny movie......u wanna get hunked with some cool bruce willis samuel l jackson john travolta thingies with a quentin tarantino cocktail....this is ur drink..............i loved it....my tym's worth it.....my night-not-sleeping worth it.........it md me happy.....
22/03/2005,1,"A pair of assassins in search of McGuffin, unclear what's inside but it's probably nothing, employed by Marcellus to recover his debts, in the course of their work, people lose their assets; one hitman's called Vincent who likes to shoot up, not just firearms but with needles close up, when out with the wife of the boss cuts it close, as she snorts all his gear and then goes overdose; a boxer called Butch throws a fight the wrong way, Marcellus sends Vince to reclaim the foul play, but events take a turn, there's a bit of a twist, as the boss and the boxer are caught in a tryst; a cleaner called Winston removes every trace, of all that remains when you're shot in the face, and a pair of till robbers with new openings, help Jules to consider, should he do other things."
21/03/2005,1,"So original, it comes off like an experimentational movie, but one that catches fire with absolutely brilliant writing, dialogue, and character creation, in addition to all-time standout performances by every single actor, which means the directing was also superb.Some people may still question what it's about because for the most part we have four different stories converging at various coordinates in a timeline loop that do not clearly have a meaning as to why other than to just have creative fun with the way it's told.You have a philosophizing, bible thumping hitman (Samuel L Jackson) finding his path to salvation and restored faith and theism while participating in the events that comprise the movie. This movie is perfect in so many scenes with only a few weak parts. It's loaded with memorable lines, and it was meticulously cared for into every last detail including the music and what dance moves characters should have in addition to the outrageously brilliant screenplay that somehow never slips over the top.Tarantino still hasn't even come close to this lightning in a bottle masterpiece."
19/03/2005,1,"Some observations:1. Anytime your most admiring audience is comprised of 17-year-old males you know you're in trouble.2. Anytime the most common adjective used to describe your movie is ""cool"" you know you're in trouble.This is a silly, juvenile, vulgar movie. Tarantino should have had the courage to make a cheap, violent, trashy Hollywood-style movie and been proud of it. Instead, he made a cheap, violent, trashy, Hollywood-style movie and hid behind the ""irony"" façade. Works for 17-year-olds, doesn't work for the rest of us."
17/03/2005,1,"A modern and iconic masterpiece, the vibe that this movie gives while watching it is something out of ordinary. To me, it was like a strangely pleasant and optimistic sensation running trough my stomach. What cinema can do is amazing, and this work is the proof."
11/03/2005,1,"After having seen how ""Pulp Fiction"" has infiltrated its way into current pop culutre (the dance contest, Royale with cheese, etc.), I finally got a chance to see the movie from the beginning and couldn't believe what a huge letdown it was. There was nothing for me to grasp to make me care about what the characters were doing and why they were doing it, and the overly gratuitous use of the f-bombs put me off completely. It's almost as if swearing was substituted for wit and clever dialogue. I felt like Tarantino was trying to impress me with how much of a movie geek he is, but if he tried to make a movie with an engaging story, I might have liked it more. The only person he's impressing is himself, and it isn't working."
09/03/2005,1,"I did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because I love the casting in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.The movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. And in some ways the movie does live up to it's hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like it's the only movie worth watching - like it is the ""King of Films"". Yes Pulp Fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching - not just this film.7/10"
08/03/2005,1,"In my humble opinion, I believe that this is Tarentino's finest movie. As I grew older and older I've come to realize that this masterpiece from the 90s aged like fine wine. It's easily one of the most rewatchable movies considering it's filled with an insane amount of quotables, great cinematography and most importantly, charming characters that will stand the test of time.I truly believe that this movie is a work of art, the way Tarentino handpicked the songlist for the soundtrack helped elevate every single scene of the movie to a whole new level.To cut this short, this movie is easily one of the best movies ever made, and my personal favorite movie and I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to give it a shot."
08/03/2005,1,"Praise for this movie is abundant in media, and rightfully so. Pulp Fiction is one of the most fun and satisfying movies I've ever watched. Being a Tarantino movie, its characters and dialogue are top notch. This is probably the #1 movie I would recommend to someone (if they haven't seen it) as it's very easy to get into and you can just let go of reality and be sucked into the film."
07/03/2005,1,"I can't exactly tell why I love it so much, but this is the best movie I have ever watched. It is well known that Tarantino is a genius, but this is by far his best work. This is what you call a masterpiece."
04/03/2005,1,"I tried to complete it many times and i just can't. It's too boring and the silence between every word and the next is too long, most of the film with no dialogues that effect or support the story.The characters don't have any true connection to eachother or to the viwer they just meets eachother because the writer want that , the blood is over and have no logic also the movie just goes without clear directions no drama no massages not even true fire guns and gangs work, its just characters moving with some
shooting and a lot of blood.Seriously bad color grading and camera movements, i didn't feel in touch with any character or scene except the first 20-30 minutes."
20/02/2005,8,"No more words to describe this film are necessary. It contains what it takes to be considered a true classic! Its characters are a film by themselves, sometimes the plot is not even necessary because we are stuck to those fascinating creatures doing wacky things."
19/02/2005,8,I just managed to stay awake through this load of crappy excuse for a motion picture! It only contains a enormous amount of words that don´t say anything. The two main characters are so stupid that they should never have been created. And when Bruce Willis disappears from the movie it is so totally dead. This is a total waste of time. And so is commenting on this junk so I will stop now.
12/02/2005,8,"The towering behemoth that is Pulp Fiction. Whats there to write that hasn't already been written. Probably nothing.But as humans we of course try to look for meanings in everything as ridiculous that is - this film can be whatever you want it to be. Who is good and who is bad? Whats in the briefcase? Was it really an accident shooting Marvin in the face?No one knows and quite frankly my dears - I don't give a dam. That's what makes this film so great, as well as of course Tarantino's signature razor sharp dialogue that goes on throughout making the viewer instantly want to go out and buy a tasty burger. Simply a must watch....well you're bound to watch it more than just once."
31/01/2005,8,"It seems escaping any definition. It is pure Tarantino. Or, more precise, one of the most Tarantino films. For the reasons who determs you see again , time by time. For stories and characters and dialogues and memorable scenes. For the music and for high performances. And for the unexpecting turns. And for the illusion to be an ordinary chain of stories. For emotions. And for the manner to tell them. And, sure, for the fascinating magic. And for too many others."
31/01/2005,8,"Certainly a monumental film, with some great character developments and a uniquely woven storyline; however, after watching this film a few years later, I can't help but think that Tarantino was just coming up with excuses to pepper the film with derogatory racial terminology."
28/01/2005,8,"There aren't many films I remember watching on the big screen, but Pulp Fiction in 1994 was a red letter date. It was so unexpected, non-linear and unique, it absolutely blew me away. Watching it again nearly thirty years later, and it is still a masterpiece. Quentin has undoubtedly delivered films almost as good, but none better. 10/10."
27/01/2005,8,"This is #18 in the top 250 on IMDB. With some big actors like Travolta, Jackson, and Willis, it doesn't lack namepower. I enjoyed this consistently, but it didn't blow me away, so I can't call it one of the best ever. I'm also not a fan of Tarantino's out-of-chronology approach, which messes things up a bit (like a character dying in one scene, then appearing in the next). The acting was strong besides an awful performance by Tarantino himself in a guest appearance, the script just didn't hit me. It had some great moments though. The ""big three"" of the movie (those names above) were really good, Willis in particular, who showed that he can really act when he isn't just blowing things up. Good movie, just not anything memorable for me."
26/01/2005,8,"Quentin Tarentino may claim that Inglorious Bastards is his masterpiece but all of his fans know that no movie of his will ever come close to touching his window into a fast chaotic world called ""Pulp Fiction"". Chapter 1. Original Writing: Even though Tarentino has said that his films are throwbacks to many older Japanese films and spaghetti westerns, there is one original recurring part of his films that makes them incredible to watch even if the story sucks and thats the dialogue. His characters are so beloved by many of his fans because they're so interesting to listen too.Chapter 2 . The Way It Was Told: If you think about it Pulp Fiction is a simple story but the way that it was presented to its curios audience is why it's such a memorable movie. Even though Reservoir Dogs had the same story arch as pulp I don't believe that it was executed in to it's truest potential. Well Pulp Fiction Filled in the cracks with more character development in a shorter time period because of Tarentino's improving skills in fast and witty dialogue. The way that the characters are introduced and dismissed from us i feel is a type of miscellaneous presentation that I had never seen be done before.Chapter 3. Soundtrack And Acting: While watching this incredible experience for a seventh time the other night with the presence of my father who admitted before watching that he is not the biggest fan of Tarentino's taste in music . I on the other hand find that is soundtrack is amazing in every movie. I t influences music lovers and aids the style of the story. Many artists had their debut with this movie such being Neil Diamond.Another aid through the film is the acting in which is very believable and coooool!!!!!!!!!!!! Jackson,and Therman became someone and Travolta was saved at last with a good role. But whose performance really stuck out for me was Ving Rham's when he was down in the basement giving Bruce Willis the low down low. The same goes for Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogueing at the beginning and end of this fantastic film.Soooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall see this movie. Twice!!!!!!!! Actually see it three times, no four time, no, oh I don't know. Buy it, buy it and cherish it for all of time because it truly is a masterpiece."
19/01/2005,8,"My all time favorite! Must watch movie!Tarantino's directorial genius shines through in every frame, effortlessly blending multiple storylines into a tapestry of nonlinear storytelling. This narrative choice, though initially disorienting, heightens the film's suspense and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. It's like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, with each piece fitting together in unexpected ways, leaving you astonished by the final picture.The cast, featuring an ensemble of incredibly talented actors, delivers performances that are nothing short of extraordinary. John Travolta's portrayal of Vincent Vega, a suave yet conflicted hitman, is a revelation. His charisma and vulnerability make Vega an unforgettable character, and his dance scene with Uma Thurman's captivating Mia Wallace is a cinematic moment that has become etched in film history.Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of the philosophical hitman Jules Winnfield, commands the screen with his magnetic presence and delivers some of the film's most iconic lines. His performance strikes a delicate balance between intensity and introspection, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.Uma Thurman's portrayal of Mia Wallace is a masterclass in character development. She effortlessly embodies the allure and complexity of her character, leaving you both mesmerized and wary of her intentions. Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth also deliver exceptional performances, adding layers of depth to the intricate narrative.What sets ""Pulp Fiction"" apart is Tarantino's unparalleled ability to infuse mundane conversations with electrifying tension and dark humor. The dialogue crackles with wit, profanity, and pop culture references, showcasing Tarantino's unique voice as a filmmaker. Each conversation becomes a microcosm of the human experience, exploring themes of redemption, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions.Visually, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a feast for the eyes. Tarantino's meticulous attention to detail, combined with Robert Richardson's stunning cinematography, creates a stylized world that oozes with grit and authenticity. The use of eclectic music, ranging from surf rock to soulful ballads, adds another layer of richness to the overall experience.In conclusion, ""Pulp Fiction"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that deserves every ounce of praise it has received over the years. It is a thrilling, thought-provoking journey that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and explores the darker aspects of human nature. If you're seeking a film that challenges conventions and leaves an indelible mark on your soul, ""Pulp Fiction"" is an absolute must-watch."
19/01/2005,8,"The story involving various characters that has an attachment to their story arch even if they aren't direct with each other.The casting fits perfectly with very good performance without over glorifying their character.It is a rare occasion that this kind of story arch to include enough action, drama to keep the audience intertwine. The score fits very well without telling you should be a excited for the moments you are watching. It is an interesting turn around of the two main characters (the hitman) John Travolta and Samuel Jackson at the beginning and to end.A highly recommended film to watch."
09/01/2005,9,"What can one say about Pulp Fiction, that hasn't already been said about it? One of the best action films ever? No doubt about that. A masterpiece? Said thousands of times. Quentin Tarantino best film? Said even more. One of the best of the '90s? Been said even more again. It's one of those all-around great movies. Everything from the directing, writing, acting, editing, soundtrack, humour, even the set pieces  the adrenaline shot, the ""Bad Motherf*****"" wallet, and of course the much-documented suitcase (the contents of which we never find out)  is flawless.Then there's the classic characters. The two bickering hit men Vincent Vega (a career-resurrecting performance by John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (a hilariously unforgettable Samuel L. Jackson), their boss's sexy wife Mia (Uma Thurman), the desperate prize-fighter, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and the two clumsiest bank robbers ever put on film (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), all of them enjoyable. Travolta, Jackson and Thurman were all nominated for Oscars for their performances.This was the movie that changed the face of indie films forever. But ultimately it's Tarantino's movie. He is responsible for putting all the elements of it together to form one massive and enormously enjoyable ensemble piece. His direction is outstanding and his screenplay  one of the best ever written  is even better. With great character development, wild action scenes, brilliantly inspired dialogue and memorable conversations between the characters involving everything from robbing restaurants to foot massages to the names of European hamburgers, it's no wonder why it won the film's only Oscar.Throw in some clever editing, a typically Tarantino '60s and '70s soundtrack, and fine cinematography  the single shot of Jules and Vincent walking through the foyer of an apartment building is a highlight  and you've got yourself a masterpiece, one of the best movies of all time.Let's face it, Pulp Fiction is most certainly not one to show to the kiddies (the F-word is used an unbelievable 271 times throughout its 2 1/2 hours, and that's just for starters) or to watch with Grandma (the rapist scene is not for the faint-hearted), but that only makes it even more of a guilty pleasure.It remains the crowning achievement of one of the most daring and individual film-making talents to come out of the '90s.10/10."
04/01/2005,9,"This is one of the best movies of all times.It is shocking and filled with useless violence. It is disgustingly realistic. But it also shows some of the most disturbed, dangerous and cruel personalities that I could imagine still having trances of humanity in them.While reading some of the ""I hated it"" comments I can't stop from remarking that what they are saying is true. Of course sodomy, sickening drug use, useless violence, accidental shootings and filth of the language are not amusing. And frankly speaking the characters are build using especially the utterly pointless dialog, the coolness of their looks, the idiotic jokes that so many mistake for attempts at comedy. Those are the characters.Also... if you think art is about telling you a story just like the ones your mama used to read at bed-time... think again. Art is about feelings. Not about stories. I have yet to see a great book/painting/sculpture/music/film that is about the story. Sure, the story is there. But it does not matter were it takes you, what matters is what leaves behind.Yes, this movie is not entertaining, it is not nice, it is racist and it is degrading. And it is so to the point were you actually ask yourself... can this be happening? Can this be real? And then you are just saying to yourself ""I'm so glad it's not my reality..."""
03/01/2005,8,"First 40 minutes were great but then it became... boring? Just a collection of anecdotes? Great soundtrack, funniest character of Samuel L. Jackson, but overall... Isn't it overvalued?"
03/01/2005,8,"Pulp Fiction is one of the worst blights on American Cinema anyone could conceive of. Tarantino's enthusiasm for the awful films he loves to rehash is amusing, and his dialogue snappy and funny, but he is not a great filmmaker and his films are not great films. Him and his films get by on retro-mania, smugness, and arrogance, and will date as horribly as his source material has. Tarantino is symptomatic of everything that is wrong with indie filmmaking in the nineties, and nineties youth culture in general. Cinema, and the world, could have done without him."
31/12/2004,8,"This is one of those flicks I can watch over and over again, one of those that is continuously referenced in day to day life amongst me and my friends. The storyline is fantastic and gripping throughout and it has just the right mixture of violence, twists and romance.Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta together are 2 of my favourite movie characters of all time, their rapport is great yet they portray professionalism too. I actually have a canvas of their Pulp Fiction characters in my house they are that iconic in my world!Never been a huge fan of Uma Therman but I could watch her in this over and over again, she plays her character extremely well."
18/12/2004,7,"Pulp Fiction is an all time favorite for me, and one of the best movies of the 90's. All the small stories playing along and being bound together in the end.And I really like how Tarantino are building up the story in a both serious and fun way, at the same time. Good entertainment all the way."
08/12/2004,8,"Simply a classic. Tarantino perfectly portrayed mad skills with the timing and event sequence of this film. Although, the real and raw down to earth style persona of almost every character was my favorite aspect of the film. Stellar performances by everyone including Tarantino himself. I even think of Tarantino when buying gourmet coffee. LOL 10 Stars never the less."
08/12/2004,8,"The performance and top-notch acting along with Quentin Tarantino's professionalism makes this movie a true masterpiece. This movie revolves around more than one story - the stories are not in order but they are ordered in a way that keeps you amazed once you finish the movie. Although this movie is not classified as comedy, it will definitely make you laugh, which is quite surprising considering that it is a Crime/Drama.Summing up, great performances, great plot and amazing cast - a very well done work of art, would definitely recommend watching if you have not watched yet."
04/12/2004,8,"Could make a movie so good?! There's something to be said about how perfectly Pulp Fiction flows with such a non-linear story line. Quentin Tarantino had already earned his spurs with Reservoir Dogs, and now decided to take everything to the nines with his sophomore film. The beauty of Pulp Fiction is how the story lines are so well intersected, and yet it begins and ends nearly exactly the same way. Not only is it one of the most important films of the 1990s, but it served as a platform for incredible dialogue, a veritable showcase depicting the bleak yet flashy glamour of 90s' LA, and a scenario of sorts of just what ordinary, and not-so-ordinary people can do when under duress."
30/11/2004,10,"What a great movie. I have seen it for the first time this week. Nine years after its released I have finally got a chance to watch it. I probably watched it for the first time now because I probably wouldnt understand it when it first came out. Im 17 and i really liked this crime drama. Quentin Tarantino is brillaint! His imagination of a crime world is breathtaking. This film probably plots out the lifes of actual hitmen. Travolta and Jackson,  2 seemingly careless hitmen just doing their duty. Travoltas adventure with Thurman very exciting and breathtaking. For a hitman travoltas character was a pretty nice guy. Took a girl out for dinner, danced with her, and even saved her life from a drug overdose. Sadly, Travolta's character comes to a how do you say with out spoiling this...... a tragic moment. Willis's character, was sharp and smart. He plays a boxer who is on the run from a crime boss (Ving Rhames)for killing a boxer in a match. Willis stupid foreign wife forgets willis precious watch which was up his dad's rectum for 7 years and then given to his friend after he was killed and then gaven to his son. Willis then gets into a pretty disgusting and strange confrentation with a bunch of weirdos at a gun shop. Willis though does get himself out of trouble by helping that certain crime boss.... from a bit of a embarrising life memory. Willis does another great performance in another Great film. Now Jackson probably had the most noblelest role of the whole film. A hit man, partners with travolta's character who is only trying to do his job. Even a person who worships the lord himself. Jackson gets into a couple of frenzy in the films. One when his partner accidentally blows some kids brains out in the back of his car and must have the body taken care of and the car cleaned. And the other, is a robbery happening at a restaurant. TIm Roths character is amazingly changed and shut up'd by jacksons character. Though Jackson stoppeD tim roths character from being mr bad boy robber, to mr scared straight robber. Jackson does though let roth keep the money from all the victims. What a great guy huh????? This is film is indeed Pulpilicous. I give this film a 5 out of a possible 5."
26/11/2004,10,This one of favourite films of all time! I saw this 3 times now i never got bored and i love this film. And Quentin Tarantino is one of my favourite filmmaker! And samuel L. Jackson one of my favourite actor. And this is my top 3 films of all time!!
22/11/2004,10,"This is the film that redefined movies in general. With a great script, actors and actresses that really gives their best performance, and a masterful director to finish, Pulp Fiction is a classic masterpiece that I dare say beats any other movie masterpieces the world known. Pulp Fiction is a crime movie that is in love with dialogue. And the dialogue ranges from a simple random chat to an argument about miracles. Quentin Tarantino seems to just put in everything he can think of while writing this script, and I have to say, it worked. You will find yourself repeating the lines that are said in this movie long after the end credits rolled. Although this isn't a comedy movie, Pulp Fiction always delivers scenes after scenes that are absurd, ridiculous, and at times roaringly hilarious. A scene in the car near the end of the movie had me rolling on the floor because it was so damned funny. There are some other scenes that had me rolling on the floor too but I'll let you watch the movie yourself to see which ones are they. Yes, this is one of those movies that you can just watch over and over again and never get bored of watching. Loads of reasons why, not to mention the great script, great acting, great music, and the fantastic effort from the now well-known Quentin Tarantino. I must've watched it over a 100 times and I have never been bored of watching it. So, why don't you go do yourself a favour and go watch this movie if you haven't already. And believe me, you will want to watch it again. More than twice."
14/11/2004,10,"Quentin Tarantino is a cinema genius. He knows how to make a movie engaging, and ""Pulp Fiction"" is such an engaging watch. The dialogue is witty and charming. It makes you come to love everyone of the characters. This is a solid cast with some of the most quotable and iconic scenes in cinema history. However, one of the most engaging things about ""Pulp Fiction"" is its story. The way this movie delivers its story was ground breaking for the time. The story is told out of order with different parts of the story focusing on different characters. It is up to audience to piece together how the different stories connect. The film is always delivering subtle details. This also works in conjunction with the cast. They all deliver very expressive yet subtle performances that really give the audience a view into what each character is thinking. This movie is also packed to the brim with adult humor which just works. The question of the day though is what is the point of this movie and I say to that, there is not point. Everyone will get something different from this movie, and what the audience gets from this movie will vary from person to person. However, there is no denying that this is one of the greatest movies of all time. It is the Vanilla of Tarantino and a must watch for anyone who likes movies and stories in general."
28/10/2004,10,"This movie is astounding. It seamlessly combines all of the elements thats make a movie great and runs with it. QT is a master film maker who uses music more effectively than any other person in the business. The style and flair of the film are unmatched and the overall experience is unforgettable. I hate usually hate John Travolata but this movie made me realize that he is actually capable of creating a movie that is decent. Sam Jacksona and Uma Thurman are amazing and give possibly the best performances of their career. Bruce Willis shocked me the most. Not only did he show that he can play a real person, but he also showed that he can make the role believable and interesting. This movie is simply put the best film of all time."
12/10/2004,10,"Hey, you all (dang IMDb won't let me post ""y'alls"" as it should be) With page after page after page of good reviews, I'm going to watch this one again! Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll.It might incite your soul.This is a great movie. I am particularly fond of the second scene at Lance's house. I like the blinking chandelier in the dining room. But I still wonder about all those platform shoes on pedestals. Another manifestation of QT's fetish?What's in the briefcase?Death. It is so beautiful."
30/09/2004,10,"This is a disturbingly dark humoured masterpiece. This has everything to keep you entertained from the off. Sex, drugs, rock and roll, violence with a bit of awesome acting thrown in. Some awesome dialogue that is class."
31/08/2004,7,"This movie is so good every piece of dialogue is gold.Tarantino pays homage to classic film making while at the same time solidifying his own place in movie history. Its a great way to build his legacy after Reservoir Dogs and just shows how much work he puts into every aspect of his craft. The jumbling plot is great as it moves back and forth in time to create a unique atmosphere within itself. The story is unique and goes through a lot of twists to keep its self fresh and ready for re watch again, again and again.I only wish it was longer, so I could stay in its rich world longer. All I have to say is thank you Tarantino."
29/08/2004,7,"I have lost count of the amount of time I have watched this film. I enjoy watching all of Quentin Tarantino's films but this has to be one of my favourite. There is plenty of action and bad language, they just don't make films like this anymore. Tarantino's films have garnered both critical and commercial success. He has received many industry awards, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two BAFTA Awards and the Palme d'Or, and has been nominated for an Emmy and a Grammy. He was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time in 2005,[4] and filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich has called him ""the single most influential director of his generation"
18/08/2004,6,"Cinema is not like rock and roll, but once or twice in a generation someone will come along and try to reinvent cool for the screen. In our generation, just such a personage is Quentin Tarantino, a writer-director who raised the snappy, witty dialogue of the gangster genre to the level a cunning art. Pulp Fiction is arguably his signature movie.It has a screenplay of perfect construction, full of symbolism and tiny elements that play off one another throughout the two-and-a-half hour runtime. As with Tarantino's debut, Reservoir Dogs, the dialogue is a continual complement to the action, in contrast to cinema's usual actions-over-words ethos. There are actually often more words then are strictly needed, for the sake of rhythm or emphasis, such as Uma Thurman saying ""five, as in there's 1-2-3-4-5 of us"". One of the best things about the Pulp Fiction screenplay is that, though ostensibly a gangster movie, it's also very much not. There is much of the mundane aspects of criminality, such as Lance asking his wife for baggies and twisticks, and the irony of hoods relying upon a cleaner and an underworld medic for things they got up to when off-duty, as it were.Tarantino's style as a visual director is, for the most part, beautifully simple. In an era where edits seem to come every two seconds, Pulp Fiction features some refreshingly long takes. It's a very minimalist style – he doesn't show us anything we don't really need to see. During the Kahuna burger exchange, he breaks it down to just two opposing but contrasting shots, a close-up of Samuel L. Jackson and the mid-shot of Brad with Jackson and Travolta before and behind him. Some scenes open with just a series of close-ups, and for much of the movie, sets and scenery are barely noticeable. This puts the focus totally on the actors, something that is all too often forgotten in the more showy, technical movies of the modern age. That's not to say backgrounds never matter. Once in a while there is a brilliant something-or-other to be noticed, like the game of Operation in Lance's house, standing out amid the dull-coloured bric-a-brac for a second or two.The reams of dialogue and this attention given to actors puts a burden on the cast that has similarities to that in a stage play. And as with classic stage acting the performances here are certainly exaggerated, a kind of heightened version of reality, albeit a world away from theatrical hamming. Uma Thurman particularly stands out, sparkling with energy and delight, and a flirtatious frisson with an also-impressive John Travolta. Michael Madsen was the original choice for the role, but Travolta has a somewhat softer approach that is just right. Finest of all though is surely Samuel L. Jackson, who has this brilliantly menacing stillness, contrasting with a rhythmic, shifting tone in his words. Jackson is to Tarantino what Laurence Olivier is to Shakespeare; he can speak the lines as if he's actually thinking them.My only problem with Pulp Fiction is it's sometimes too clever for its own good, filled with too many embellishments, too many attempts to be outstanding and different. There are some moments that just seem almost twee in a way, like when Thurman's ""square"" is literally drawn on the screen. But by-and-large Pulp Fiction is a work of much filmmaking genius, and it's hardly surprising that creativity as vibrant as this will come bubbling through the seams here and there."
11/08/2004,6,"Awesome Film by Quentin Tarantino.Samuel L. Jackson played very well for this movie,his performance is really good.You need to watch this movie before you die! Also,i wonder how is the taste of Big Kahuna Burger because it seemed delicious to me.I really wonder the taste of it. It's not my favorite Tarantino movie but its the Fourth.In my opinion,best movie of Quentin Tarantino is Django Unchained.Second movie is Kill Bill vol.1 third is Kill Bill vol.3 then Pulp Fiction. No need for more words,now you guys know my opinion about this movie.Don't forget to watch this movie! You wont regret its not a waste of time. Believe me its not."
09/08/2004,7,"I really don't know what the big deal is. This is obviously another one of those ""highly intellectual"" movies I am too stupid to understand. The critics compare it to ""The Godfather""... I find that to be sacrilegious! I agree with one critic only when he states that the film ""presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and almost lyrical fashion"", and I would like to put a big emphasis on MEANINGLESS!!! How can something meaningless be good?Another famous critic, Roger Ebert, claims ""Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one..."" That is amazing! One of the world's most acclaimed film critics watches a 'masterpiece', and right after that cannot decide whether it is really a masterpiece or garbage? Then he goes on to say, 'oh, but it can't be garbage if such an in-director made it, so it must be a masterpiece'. So much for competent individual judgment... I suppose you would not be able to call yourself a critic if you wrote that Tarantino simply screwed up this time...In my opinion, the film has a ton of famous actors, an ""in"" director, and nothing else. The plot is practically non-existent, there is no message, no ""higher"" meaning, nothing but violence for the sake of violence..., and above all, it does not entertain either! If this is art nowadays, I want to go back to the past!"
25/07/2004,9,"Is there a theme and message in this crime-action-thriller? Yes there is, and not only is it explicit but also has a subliminal, implicit theme. The theme of noticing, recognizing, and interpreting clues, signs, omens, apparent coincidences, and miraculous happenings and their significances in the choices you then make.There are two distinct, divergent views (and type of persons) on the occurrence of inter-connected events in the world. The first or traditional view is that apart from the mundane, any strange or unusual or inter-connected events are due to super-natural connected causes or divine intervention, and the other is the modern scientific-atheist view that these are merely coincidences, chance, or accidental events and only mistakenly appear to be strangely connected only because they are extremely improbable. According to this latter view, given enough time, even a monkey with a typewriter can eventually produce a Shakespearean tragedy, just as a few basic elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen etc., given enough time and all the right conditions (near impossibility), will eventually come together to form a highly complex living organism like a bacteria out of sheer chance...by now you get the picture.In this movie, Jules who is one of the key characters is of the first type, and his partner Vincent is not exactly of the second type but rather the type who doesn't give a damn either way – the kind that never reflects upon any happening. When the 'miracle' happens, Jules immediately recognizes it, whereas Vincent couldn't care less, and so Jules knows that this sign, the omen, the extremely unlikely happening is of direct significance for him and him alone and immediately decides to make a choice – to make a U-turn in his life of crime. That decision empowers him, and when he comes to face another event where he has the choice either to kill or not to kill – he makes the right one.Jules stands redeemed and empowered, but Vincent has learned nothing and meets his fate as a man would who has lived his life 'unconsciously'. Samuel Jackson as Jules stands out as the most intense actor and delivers his lines as a champion boxer going for the knockout punch. The others are really peripheral characters – the ones who fill in the scene to make it more colorful.If this movie makes you more conscious of the unusual happenings in your life and then correctly derive their significance effectively for yourself, rather than dismiss the whole 'miracle of life' as mere chance coincidences, you will have got the message of this film, otherwise its good entertainment only."
25/07/2004,9,"I saw a lot of people talking that is one of the best movies ever, but i dont know, for me it is not so good. I dont know, maybe i just dont like movies like this, but in some moments i could sleep because i was bored.
Hm, for me it is not so good how they are talikng, maybe i didnt understand the story or something, but.."
25/07/2004,9,"*a few spoilers below* I remember seeing this movie at a theater when it was first released. I was very excited and eager to see it as I had heard a lot of positive ""buzz"" about it. I was very disappointed for many reasons including: 1. Glorification of violence - all the ""cool characters are cold blooded murderers, drug abusers or sadists. I cannot identify or become emotionally involved with these type of characters. I didn't care if any of the main characters lived or died. In fact I would have preferred if they all died in the end because they were all terrible excuses for humans. 2. Attempting to mix realistic violence with humor. In the scene where the guy was accidentally shot in the back seat of the car, a few people around me laughed. Others gasped that someone would laugh. I will never forget the guy in the theater sitting behind me saying out loud ""wait, that's funny right? Isn't that supposed to be funny"" Many action films have cartoonish violence - it's understood that the violence is farcical. This movie seemed to be saying murder and rape are funny and cool. 3. The scene with the gimp was way over the top, not necessary, and sadistic. Again, is this supposed to be amusing and entertaining? 4. The dialog seemed to be random and unconnected and without purpose. People cite lines about McRoyal with cheese like it is profound. Is it me, am I missing something? 5. You have to completely suspend your disbelief at the coincidences that occur. A guy is driving on a random street and happens to pull right up next to the guy trying to kill him? I am at a loss as to why this movie is rater so high. It had some snappy editing, and a few genuinely humorous moments. But is was a film about nothing but a fictionalized underbelly of society."
20/07/2004,9,"Quentin Tarantino delivers THE masterpiece in gangster films. It's story is presented in a non-chronological way, which goes to show the brilliant editing it has. The dialogs are fast, funny, and flow like honey... absolutely delicious. To bad that the academy decided to punish Tarantino by only giving him one lousy award... it was really unfair, just because he's an ""indy"" director."
13/07/2004,9,"Having extreme close-ups of objects such as a hamburger and a syringe (they are particularly reminiscent of James Rosenquist's paintings), quoting from numerous historic flicks, and referring to subculture icons in a humorous manner (most notably, Travolta wearing the T-shirt of UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs), Pulp Fiction is a film version of American Pop Art, visually, technically, and conceptually. Retrospectively, it is a bit odd that it didn't take place earlier than the 90s; probably the narrative film is a relatively conservative art form and had to wait until the sampling concept became popular in the other field, i.e., music. Along with other ingredients, such as jocularly detailed dialogues and a non-linear plot, Quentin Tarantino has established one of the biggest trends in the mainstream American cinema in the 90s. The impression that the film now starts belonging to the past tells how much impact it has had on the particular era; it represents, summarizes, and encapsulates the 90s in the same way Easy Rider does for the 60s."
04/07/2004,9,"Judging from some of the other reviews posted here, there are people that actually dislike this movie.  I suppose the violence and drug use might turn some people off, but that is absolutely not what this movie is about.  The dialogue just crackles in this movie.  Almost every scene is pitch perfect - Christopher Walken's watch delivery speech, that opening discussion about buying drugs in Amsterdam, etc.  It is really sad that there are people that don't like this movie. I feel sorry for them, but at the same time am very glad I don't know them."
01/07/2004,9,"i watched this 2 and a half time and had totally different experiences in each time. the first time i watched was very long ago and i don't remember much except i had really fun and loved the movie a lot , because i remember telling everyone to watch. the second time i watch was for me to remember how great movie it was and enjoy. even if it wasn't very good as i expected , i had fun for the second time. Third time was for a friend. when that recent night we couldn't choose a movie to watch i recommended ""pulp fiction"" to watch. We started watching but both of us were so bored to finish. I still smile when i remember some scenes from the movie but i regret i watched it over and over again to ruin. I don't know why i don't like that much anymore but if you still didn't watch you definitely give a chance"
22/06/2004,9,"In modern day LA a set of barely-connected gangsters, corrupt failures and their hangers-on go about their daily business.A film with a lot to answer for. Certainly it took director Quentin Tarantino from cult director to magazine cover star and created a raft of imitators. It put a few noughts on the pay cheque of Samuel L Jackson and brought John Travolta back from B movie hell.Like Star Wars it is difficult to know if you are reviewing the movie or the hype. This movie lived on word-of-mouth. They didn't need to hype it - it grew from a modest budget black comedy to being the movie that everyone was talking about.The title says it all ""Pulp Fiction."" That means those cheap novels that you read on airplanes or on the beach: full of characters that you know by heart, stories that you have heard before. This movie makes fun of a few of these characters.While this is a black comedy, the film world has been blacker, but it has never been funnier. I'd have never have thought that bringing a drug overdose back from the dead would make me laugh, but it does. A failed attempt at homicide make me laugh, but it does. I could on a while longer.And just when you are getting clever-clever and think you have it all figured out off the film shoots of in another direction. Amazing. This is a must see twice movie - there is so much little detail you miss first time around - things that make what happens later clearer.I am always worried about morals. Few movie viewers are. They are more worried about being entertained. Just look at bullying you see on the playground, not at the act, but the bystanders (male and female) laughing , joking and enjoying.Whether I like it or not Tarantino forces me to be one of these people - and there are times I don't like it. He is more restrained than in Reservoir Dogs (another great movie) but people are brought on to be carried out - if you see what I mean.There is only one scene that is totally without justification. The scene where Travolta drives while high on drugs - he should have been shown have at least had a near-accident. But he just cruises along without a problem.The thing I notice is that the film is slipping in the IMDb ratings. I know why. The film has become overblown and over discussed. This isn't To Kill A Mockingbird or Shindler's List with social history to support it past its initial afterglow.We have even seen a TV series - The Sopranos - that is just as good and which borrows a few of its tricks. I learned nothing new about my life (or how to live it) from watching Pulp - not even from repeat viewings - but it is a brilliant piece of cinema that cannot be ignored, just as long as you take it as simple entertainment and remember the title at all times."
22/06/2004,9,Tarantino delivers a second masterpiece and brings us his unbridled genius in a hail of bullets and humor. Using a cut up method of storytelling comes very easily to Tarantino's quick talking slickster style of moviemaking. One of those films that defined an era.
18/06/2004,9,"When I first heard about Pulp Fiction it was from my father who told me that it is a really cool, unique crime film. I was 8 years old and it wasn't that I couldn't see the movie because my parents aren't crazy like that. I didn't come around to see Pulp Fiction until I was 13. I found it on HBO On Demand and decided to rent it because it was something I always wanted to see. I absolutely fell in love, not just with Mia Wallace, the directing, the music, the beauty of three unique stories scattered around to form something that can be considered one of the best movies of all time. Quentin Tarantino immediately went down as my favorite director and a genius. I bought it on DVD VHS the soundtrack, the poster, I'm buying the script signed by all the cast. It is nothing less than a masterpiece. From two hit-man arguing over whether a foot massage or eating a girl out is in the same ballpark, to a mysterious briefcase that shines gold, Pulp Fiction is everything you want in a movie, and more. Never have I seen such a movie that goes deep into the characters and their actions. Pulp Fiction is like the day in the life of a crime bosses' wife, two hit men and a boxer and how it all fits together. Outstanding."
31/05/2004,1,"This movie has good film editing and a really good storyline. This movie is really good but not a cult movie or a great movie. Everything is just clear. It has amazing style to tell the story. But the contents in the movies are really cheap.It has some awkward scenes. They are cleaning the car in 30 minutes. Okey it brings realistic style but the whole movie is already realistic, no need to waste 30 minutes."
27/05/2004,1,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that I hear about all the time, but have never seen myself. After watching it, I'm confused about the hype surrounding this movie. I couldn't pinpoint the message the film was trying to tell. Nevertheless, the acting was outstanding (excellent cast!) and the charming style of Tarantino is unmistakable. I'd recommend a watch."
17/05/2004,1,"I have read some of the comments on this website concerning Pulp Fiction and perhaps I missed it but no one has mentioned the fact that Tarantino used an element from Elia Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"" in 1954 staring Marlon Brando. In Pulp Fiction, Marsellus Wallace told Bruce Willis that he is supposed to intentionally lose to a boxer named Wilson:Marsellus: ""In the fifth, your ass goes down. Say it.""Butch: ""In the fifth, my ass goes down.""Bruce Willis, not only doesn't go down and lose the fight, he kills Wilson. When I saw this, I became flushed with movie deja vu and felt very satisfied. Why was the boxer called Wilson? In ""On the Waterfront"" Marlon Brando has a famous monologue in which he expains how his boxing career ended: He went down intentionally against a boxer named Wilson because of greedy mobsters. Wilson, therefore was the invisble antagonist against Marlon Brando. Tarantino, being a smart guy, knew that in the deep annals of the film buff world, he could redeem Marlon Brando and all us film buffs that hate Wilson more than anything by killing Wilson. If it wasn't for Wilson, Marlon Brando ""coulda been a contender."" So, by killing Wilson forty years later, Tarantino effectively killed off the jerk that ruined Brando's Boxing career in ""On the Waterfront."" I don't know if many people had already realized this but I thought I would bring up to people's attention.Also, for Tarantino fans, watch ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (1955) by Robert Aldrich. It has the answer to why the contents of the briefcase, when opened by Travolta, give a glowing lightbeam on Travolta's face and we never see what's inside."
16/05/2004,1,"A masterpiece? Do me a favour! Perhaps it's because of the hype that surrounds this film, but I was really disappointed with what I saw.Two and a half hours was too long in my view, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary happens.I didn't find it clever, nor were the ""unforgettable"" scenes like the dance between Travolta and Thurman or Samuel L Jackson's speech unforgettable.Maybe because cinema has advanced so much since 1994 that I would have had to watch it then to appreciate it, but I only recently saw Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time and enjoyed that immensely.People go on as if this film has the best storyline and gangster scenes ever but quite frankly, it doesn't.Moreover, I found Natural Born Killers more affective for it's style than Pulp Fiction.It does have some good scenes, and I was rooting for Bruce Willis' character throughout, but I saw nothing that makes this film outstanding or worthy of being so high in IMDb's rankings."
05/05/2004,1,"It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10"
02/05/2004,1,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis."
01/05/2004,1,"Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product."
25/04/2004,5,"Now celebrating its 25th anniversary, the impact this movie had upon its release still resonates today.If people don't like this particular genre then it's unlikely that Pulp Fiction will change their minds, but for people who do, Pulp Fiction is as close to cinematic perfection as it's going to get."
18/04/2004,4,"So I've been a fan of Pulp Fiction since I was in High School. I watched the movie last night for the first time in awhile and was struck by never really knowing what was in the brief case, so I watched the scene in great detail. I noticed the apartment number was #416. So thinking this is probable related to a bible verse I looked up one starting with Matthew 4:16. I don't read the bible often if ever but since the Movie has the lighting up brief case locked at 666, and Jules set for a path of salvation on seriously changing his ways from a gangster to walking the earth in the path of the Shepard I thought to look it up. So Matthew 4:16 reads ""the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."" I think this relates to the brief case, the people who had it, to Vincent which stayed in the land of the dark and ended up dead, and to Jules which turned to ""the path of the Shepard"" as he says. A great light was shone to Jules (which was currently living in the land of the dark) after the bullets whizzed by him and a light dawned as it did for all the others in the room which where also all living in the land of the shadow of death. Just a theory but better than anything else I've looked through yet."
03/04/2004,5,"Pinnacle direction. Pinnacle screenplay. Pinnacle acting. Pinnacle cinema.These days you rarely get to see anything original, movies now-a-days have become so cliche and so predictable at an unprecedented level.Released in the 90s, when the world wasn't this 'woke' and sensitive - The Golden Age of cinema.This movie teaches a valuable life lesson - choices matter, your life isn't pre-decided and it's in your hands. It highlights vengeance, forgiveness and even love in a way which you've never experienced before.People who can't get their head around this masterpiece are the real culprits of the degrading cinema these days. Hollywood is just matching with their viewers' viewing level. This is what I believe."
27/03/2004,1,"One of the first and most memorable movies I saw in my teenage years that had a very particular way to tell a story, I couldn't help to be intrigued by all these nouvelle vague techniques that I was seeing and that showed me the range of creativity a filmmaker can have to tell a particular story with a certain aesthetic. Simply a timeless masterpiece that will forever be re-discovered by new generations."
05/03/2004,1,"I absolutely love this film. Around 5 or 6 years old, I remember looking thought my mom's VHS collection and ran across the jewel. I asked her if I could watch it, and she told me that I was too young to see it. Several years later, I remember seeing the Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega storyline on the USA station and immediately was drawn in. Even at a young age, I was intrigued with the film. Years later, I saw the full film, and wow!!! Such an amazing movie! I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino films, but Pulp Fiction is by far my favorite. With a stellar cast, amazing soundtrack, and simple but unique plot, this movie is miles ahead of many."
28/01/2004,8,Right now I can't find right words to describe this movie. I used to think that Jackie Brown is a best Quentin Tarantino's film but this movie has a much deeper meaning than Jackie Brown. You have to watch really intently to understand it. I realized how clever this movie is by watching the last scene. There is a lot of interesting dialogs which may appear pointless but they are not. There is a lot of memorable moments and interesting characters. The soundtrack is great. This movie was considered to be very violent but actually there wasn't much violence (in one episode of Oz you can see more violence than in this film). This movie is really worth your time.
02/12/2003,7,"Best movie of all time.  Quentin Tarantino may be the best story teller of all time.  His direction was something few can match.  The man is a genious why Travolta and Jackson walked away empty handed I will never understand. Anyone who didn't appreciate this film is a damn fool.  The cast was great, the stories were great, and it was just a fun film and very unappreciated when the Oscars were all said and done."
17/10/2003,10,"I find something new to like about Pulp Fiction every time I see it. Shocking, intelligent, exciting, hilarious and oddly though-provoking. Best bit: Jackson's Bible quote, Harvey Keitel, the Gimp or is it the watch dream? Two hours of highlights."
30/09/2003,10,"This movie is god like. The story, the characters, everything about it is extremely well done. I recommend this film to anyone who loves a great story as well as a little action. Even the way this movie is presented is great. Being that it is four stories, about one story, (well, more like 3 but whos counting). The mystery with the briefcase still has me wondering and guessing. The acting, don't get me started, even the cast, I mean, you cant go wrong with Sam Jackson, John Travolta, and Bruce Willis, not to mention Uma Thurman. This is definitely Quentin's best film.10/10"
03/08/2003,7,I love this movie i can quote lines from so many parts lol i love how every ones story kinda mixes and the Easter eggs of of movies is just great if your a fan of the director! Really entertaining keeps your attention thats for sure.
01/08/2003,6,"I could probably write a ten paged paper on this movie alone. I had seen other films by Tarantino before watching this one many years ago we will say 10 years ago when I was a teenager. And people here and there would mention the title pulp fiction to me and not sure why I just didn't bother to watch it till it was free on demand with comcast and was finally left in awe pondering the meaning of life for probably 30 minutes afterwards with the tv turned off. The dialogue is what sells this film along with the acting. And there are those that claim it is ultra violent and while there's some moments it's nothing like some of his others. The acting is amazing and I realized I wasn't watching a movie it's truly just an experience. This is the type of movie where you don't pop it on with a group of friends or a loved one just hanging out, it's meant to be observed, listened to, digested. There's no way to describe the plot or put it in a genre. It exists on its own. This was the movie that made me realize how important and impactful dialogue can truly be. A film doesn't need to be flashy, have crazy special effects, action every 2 minutes."
26/07/2003,9,"Pulp fiction is a story about the two gangsters, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson). At the same time it is about the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). The two separate stories get mixed up with a couple of other stories, and some people might find this confusing, but it isn't - it's brilliant! The story jumps in time, and that is why a dead guy can be alive in the next scene. The movie is driven by extremely well written dialogues, and the acting is really great performed.Either you love this movie or you hate it. Most people love it. If you hate it, see it again! I give it 8/10"
24/07/2003,9,The best film of the 90's set the standard of Independent film making. Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece will eventually be seen as one of the greatest of all time and one of the most ground-breaking films of modern times.  It was a slap in the face to all the boring movies that the 90's were spitting out.  Lost Academy Award to Forest Gump and it was sickening to my stomach to see such a lame scripted and lame acted (besides Hanks) movie win over such a great screenplay and stellar cast.  Not one actor\actress in Pulp Fiction gave a performance anywhere near as bad as the woman who played Jenny.  I get goose bumps every time Samuel L. Jackson recites Ezekiel 25:17 and John Travolta's and Uma Thurman's dance scene is one for the ages.  One the best acted and written films of all time keeps getting more and more appreciated over time.
16/07/2003,9,"Although I am a big fan of this movie, I can understand why some  people don't like this movie.  It is violent, and has a lot of cussing.  But to me, this is just a great dark comedy.  In most parts  it is funny, and at other times it is just immensely entertaining.  The acting is great, and the writing is just wonderful.  I can never get enough of the Tarantino dialogue.  This movie is just great, It is definitely one of my favorites. Pulp Fiction gets an easy 10/10 from me."
13/07/2003,9,"This movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino, and it might be - or IS the best movie that made him famous in the 1990's. The plot is fresh still today, and is far from cliche's and tools of the trade like car crashes and nonsense dialogs. Violence plays a big part, as in many of Tarantinos films, but its never out-of-place or there for its own right. On the contrary, this is no movie for children or people that takes offence in violent scenes.The main characters in the movie are played by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman, the former two are hitmen and Thurman plays the wife of a mafia boss. It also marks the come-back of Travolta, who's reputation as a disco star from ""Grease"" and ""Saturday Night Fever"" prevented him from getting major roles until ""Pulp Fiction"". Here he really shows off what a good actor he is, and the dance scene with Uma Thurman is just pure magic.I rarely see movies more than once - in fact it's less than ten movies that has been that good. I use to watch this movie every five year or so, and still it leaves me breathless. It's really the beginning of a new era in the art of film making, and both the camera, soundtrack and directing is absolutely magnificent. By purpose I didn't point out any details, since You must really explore them by Yourself in the right context. Be prepared to watch a shocking story with a nerve rarely seen!"
09/07/2003,9,"Pulp Fiction has essentially defined the indie movie. I first saw it on TV some time last year and have since put it on both my favourite movies list and least favourite movies list.Odd, that. Even though everybody seems to like the movie, to me there isn't that much to like about it.The dialogue is supposedly just ordinary chit-chat that people may have on a daily basis, but it's like that in that for the most part the dialogue is actually a sort of boring idle chat while you wait for the interesting bits. The parts of dialogue I think of in particular involve the whole chat between Vincent and Jules between the end of the opening credits and reaching the dudes' apartment (you know, about foot massages and the boss's wife etc). The same goes for much of the conversation during the Vincent-Mia ""date"", the conversation between Butch and his girlfriend, etc. Royale with cheese is interesting the first time but after about the 5th time I lost interest.Also there's the characters - Jules is supposedly one of the coolest characters in modern cinema but what's to like? He's just a black guy in a black suit who quotes the Bible and uses ""the m/f-word"" a lot. Even his redemption doesn't quite interest me so much. Likewise, the vast majority of the characters are unlikeable on some level - Vincent is a drug user who makes several bad mistakes over the course of the film (you know what I mean), Mia is a lower-class coke addict with a sugar daddy and a failed TV pilot to her name and there's nothing likable at all about Butch. The only character I really liked was the Wolf, because he just had that smooth confidence and sharp mind that seems to come alive when Harvey Keitel plays a character.As for the story  out of all three stories (the ""date"", the ""gold watch"" and the ""Bonnie situation""), my favourite had to be ""the Bonnie situation"" because it just worked. From the unexpected ""trigger"" of events, this is quite interesting because it focuses on Jules for the most part as he undergoes his ""moment of clarity"", plus watching the two cleaning up is a laugh and a half. The other stories have their interesting moments (""bring out the Gimp"") but are nowhere near as interesting because the idea is that the characters speak more often than any action happens. Oh well, such is life.The action itself is actually clichés, but done in such a way that they seem original. The examples include the assassination sequence, the car crash, etc. The one piece of action that seemed incredibly original was the entire hillbilly sex dungeon scene  probably one of the best scenes in the movie, if somewhat disturbing.In short, this is a good movie though. It's good for those of you who like ""talkies"" punctuated with action i.e. most people, but I seriously can't understand why this ends up on both my favourite movies list and least favourite movies list. Maybe it's because this movie is, among other things, bi-polar.I give it 7/10"
22/06/2003,9,"It is one of the most important movies of the 1990's if not ever, because it put Quentin Tarantino on the map as one of the directors to look out for. Pulp Fiction stars Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel and many many more and was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Why is Pulp Fiction considered a masterpiece? Because it has really well written dialog – the driving force behind this movie is the dialog, despite all the mob and gangster elements this movie has. If you love superbly written dialog in movies you will probably like Pulp Fiction. From the get going Pulp Fiction you know exactly what movie you are in for – great dialog, a lot of racial slurs and the movie being obscurely original. Instead of running in chronological order from start to finish the movie's chapters are all mixed up in a really stylish way. Half of the fun you will have with this movie is piecing the movie together after the first time you watch it. Moreover the characters are awesome as well – Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make this movie, however they are not the only ones who make the movie great.Another thing that works for Pulp Fiction is the soundtrack. After you watch Pulp Fiction you will have all these songs in your head that will make you buy the soundtrack CD, because they are all so catchy. The songs are also very well edited into the scenes in this movie. A dialog based movie? That should be extremely boring, but in this case it is not – great acting, a great premise, great dialog, it even proves that violence can indeed be funny."
21/06/2003,9,"Pulp Fiction is perhaps one of the most acclaimed movies of the 1990's. What it has going for it is superb editing, direction, and story. Even amidst all of the action and swearing we see the lives of these hitmen and mobsters. The best sequences in the film are the Thurman/Travolta piece and the diner stick up. 8.8/10. Extreme profanity, violence, and drug use."
20/06/2003,9,"Pulp Fiction is definitely a movie that can be watched over and over so that you can pick up more of the giant metaphor that Tarrantino puts on the screen. I can't give this a perfect score, however, because the more I watch this movie, the longer and longer the Thurman-Travolta story seems to take. The portions of the movie with Samuel L., John Travolta and Bruce Willis are by far the most interesting portions of the story - there is better dialogue and what lies behind the curtain is more substantial. The hour or so with Uma Thurman is simply not very interesting. It bogs the story down, bringing the movie almost to a halt. I like the way Tarrantino directs the film and the screen play is excellent, though there is so much swearing that it is almost difficult to overcome. I don't know anyone that swears nearly as much as these characters do (typical of anything QT has written) - newsflash Quentin, outswearing a Marine doesn't add to a story.Much better than average, but not exceptional. *** of ****"
17/06/2003,9,"« - I love you, Pumpkin. Pulp Fiction is a cult and timeless film because based on a director with a unique treatment of cinema. Quentin Tarantino has a real talent for turning the violence in derision so that even the dramatic moments are hilarious. Actors (including John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis) play wonderfully and its soundtrack is really great. The fact that the film focuses on the stories of several characters intersect at one time or another is interesting and original. Moreover, the dialogues are memorable and the story is very fascinating. Besides, we can almost say that all scenes are cult (scene cheeseburger, the dance scene, the scene of the cellar...) Finally, I would say it is essential for any movie buff : a head of work."
17/06/2003,9,"I've seen Sin City , and despite the mere fact that i have saw Sin City first , Pulp Fiction was much better . A mix of Hollywood's top stars come together and put a huge great performance and also one make one hell of a film , By far QT's greatest piece of work and shame on me again for buying it and not watching it sooner !!! John Travolta , Sam L Jackson , Bruce Willis , Chris Walken , Ving Rhames all make use of their time on the screen . Its so difficult to pick out a story that i like the most and maybe because the dialogue is all top notch and with a sense of humour that will make you the light of any party if you brought it along with you . Apart from that there is nothing more i can say apart from check it out - You will love it ! ""AND I WILL STRIKE DOWN UPON THEE , MOST FURIOUS Vengeance THOSE WHO THREATEN TO HURT OR Destroy MY BROTHERS"""
11/06/2003,9,"When I first watched PULP FICTION I was completely controlled by its energy. Tarantino was able to lead the entire audience around like Pepe-la-Peu was lead by the scent of perfume.I have since watched it countless times and realized that the details are what carry this movie.  The big picture (the basic stories, the characters, the situations that bring them together) is extremely interesting and alone would have been sufficient.  Yet, Tarantino threw in details that you wouldn't notice were placed on purpose.  For example, listen to the dialogue and notice how references are made in passing.  Notice that the reason Mia OD'd was because she snorted heroin thinking that it was coke since it was in a baggy rather than a balloon.  Tarantino set that scene up subtley in Lance's bedroom almost an hour before the OD.Many movie-watchers go over a film with a fine-toothed comb in order to find mistakes that the director or the actors made.  In PULP FICTION, Tarantino raises the bar by giving us treats to find within the details."
26/05/2003,1,"I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high. It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list don't waste your time!"
22/05/2003,1,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)"
17/05/2003,1,"This movie may be the most overrated film of all time, in my opinion. There is no point. It is not particularly funny. It is not particularly thought provoking. It is not some kind of masterpiece. It is, however, well made. Has good acting with a great cast. Is a fun way to divide up the scenes and plots.I was ready for this movie to end far before it did, because I learned about halfway through that there is just no purpose to it! No meaning! I definitely enjoyed aspects of it and there was some legitimate tension, without question. It all just felt messy. Truly my favorite part of watching pulp fiction were two scenes that I had seen from different memes 100 times before, and never knew where they came from. It was a, ""oh, hey, I recognize this image!"" That was the most joy I got out of this.By no means is it a trainwreck, but to be considered such a timeless masterpiece of cinematic glory? Not a chance. I would like to speak to every single person who gives this a 10 and have them explain to me what exactly this film does well, because I feel pretty confident everyone just gets in line and calls it amazing because that is the 'cool' thing to do."
12/05/2003,1,It has been almost thirty years and this film stand the test of time. I loved it the first time I saw it and I love it still. The weaving of these storylines and the intricate twists and turns have never been matched. This is new wave filmmaking at it's best. It will be studied and discussed in film schools all over the world and lauded as the best of it's kind in filmmaking history.
28/04/2003,5,"i saw this when it first came out and i didn't like it then.  i figured i'd give it another shot.  once again i don't think it's a very good movie. like most Tarantino films, it could have been great, but it just never fulfilled it's own promise.  had the entire movie been about Jackson's and Travolta's characters, i would probably have really enjoyed the movie. but the whole Uma Thurman storyline was just a waste.  i found myself wanting to see more of Jackson and Travolta.  the Bruce Willis storyline was bad, the whole ball gag scene had no point and offset any ""genius"" in this movie. when the hitmen were on, i enjoyed it, anything else was completely boring and pointless.  and the whole disjointed storytelling was certainly not anything new."
22/04/2003,5,"Before I write about this movie, I'd just like to say that this would probably be my favourite movie of all time. The dialogue is witty and the acting cool and slick.Pulp Fiction is a brilliant story split into three tales about different groups of people and how they're lives become intertwined. The events though, do not appear in chronological order. This makes the movie much more interesting. Tarantino arranges his first scene to merge with his final one in a remarkable way. Those confused by the structure will see everything clearly once the final line is spoken. The first of the three stories starts off with Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). They are making a hit for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). On their way to this hit Vincent tells Jules that about his upcoming job for Marsellus and how uneasy he feels about it. His job is to take his wife, Mia, out and show her a good time (nothing sus). This story goes on to show us the time had between Mia and Vincent. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and a finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."" This is Jules' (Samuel L. Jackson) version of Ezekiel 25:17. And it is this that he recites before he kills. But the rest of the story is about Mia and Vincent and their time together. The Second story, ""The Gold Watch"", is about a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis). It starts off with the story of his gold watch that his dad gave to him. All of the trouble that he went through to giver him his watch. After this reminisces, it comes to the present where Marsellus is paying Butch to throw the upcoming fight. I wont list the events that happen in this part of the movie, as I don't want to spoil anything. The third and final story, ""The Bonnie Situation"", clears up a few things. This chapter ties up the start of the movie and tells us how it got to the point in the cafe. It also introduces Jim (Quentin Tarantino. Vincent and Jules take a dead body to his place in order to clean up the car and so forth. This is where the Wolf is called in. (Harvey Keitel). This last scene is a great example of closure and how the characters lead up to the events already shown in the movie (hope that made sense).An excellent movie. Again, the dialogue was witty and everything in it had that feel that come when watching a Tarantino movie. 10/10. Fantastic. Will be next to impossible to beat"
18/04/2003,4,"Pulp Fiction is a real boom in action movies,unique style of Quentin Tarantino made this movie what it really is-a legend!Of course let´s not forget the great business that the actors did.Even now,after  9 years I like to watch it.It´s a first class movie for sure!"
03/04/2003,5,"One of the most over rated movies ever. This is a good movie don't get me wrong but people chalk it up to be a masterpiece of film and the best thing ever since the wheel, and i don't see eye to eye with those people sure it's cool, sure it's got good dialogue but there's a lot of awkward scenes that go on for to long. And i was not happy with the ending it was bad and not fun but i digress. My one complaint was to be left more impacted then when i came and what i saw was wild and wacky but when i left i feel like i just saw a movie that had all those cool things but not enough things to care about."
14/03/2003,1,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you."
12/03/2003,1,"It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium ."
03/03/2003,1,"Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10."
01/03/2003,1,"When you watch this movie you are not waiting for the event, you are enjoying the moment, a gunfight, a conversation, a dancing scene, and enjoying the amazing acting by everyone."
27/02/2003,8,"Great art. Perhaps the best film of the Great Tarantino. It's not my kind of movie (for that 8/10) but Pulp Fiction is a great success. A very original and catchy story, a royal cast (Bruce Wills, Uma Thurman, John Travolta ...), good music, an excellent script, worked dialogues ... In short, film to see absolutely."
25/02/2003,8,"A great film from a great Director. the film is filled with dialogues that have diverged into catch phrases. A game of actors at a high level, one of the best movies for John Travolta."
19/02/2003,8,This is the most boring nonsense I have ever watched. I don't understand all this hype this movie has among its fans. No logical story line - all the scenes look like don't make a sense at all..
17/02/2003,8,"Quentin Tarantino's masterfully written non-linear film, entertaining dialogue make for an outstanding film. Quentin brilliantly writes plot devices and dialogue that carry the film and ultimately makes it enjoyable.Although it may seem that since the film goes knowhere, why should we care or watch besides pure entertainment, but I think there are underlying lessons themes here that are universally true.I learned the following after watching this movie:
Foot massage ethics and when throwing someone off a building is justified
What to do when someone over doses on heroine
Don't mess with a guy looking for his dads watch
Always save your boss who hates you from being raped
How to clean up brain matter from your car so the cops don't notice
How to stop some crazy couple from robbing a restaurantThere are so many enjoyable scenes that Tarantino crafts with such ingenious dialogue, like the ""Royale with cheese."" ""Foot massage"" conversation and other dialogue make it seem like we are following normal people when really were following two hitmen.The thing about these conversations is that they don't even lead anywhere, but despite that they add depth to the story and the characters.8.710."
13/02/2003,8,"When Quentin Tarantino turned pulp fiction into cinematic art, everything changed. The auteur's second feature film marked the beginning of the rise of independent film in the '90s, but more importantly, it proved that the gratuitous sex, drugs, cursing and violence associated with ""low brow"" fiction could in fact be utilized intelligently for a higher artistic purpose. Essentially, ""Pulp Fiction"" proved that gratuitous genre films can be provocative and have something to say.""Pulp Fiction"" is three connected short stories sandwiched between a fourth story cut in half and used as a prologue and epilogue. The brilliance of Tarantino's screenplay (with story help from Roger Avary) comes not merely from this structure, but the way these three distinct acts tie together in unexpected, poignant ways. Act I, ""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife,"" is the film's most memorable. The stylization, the quotable dialogue and Uma Thurman's tantalizing presence as Mia Wallace stand out as the film's hallmarks, even though when weighed on the whole, this act has the least to do with the weightier, more meaningful components of the film. It begins by introducing us to Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), two black tie hit men working for Wallace (Ving Rhames) who are on their way to interrogate some young men who appear to have stolen a valuable briefcase of Wallace's. En route, they discuss such asinine things as the level of intimacy in a foot massage and what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in Paris, firmly routing the story in what appears to be meaningless drivel. The feel echoes Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" in a lot of ways. We then follow Vega in a classic ""take out the boss's wife but don't lay a finger on her"" story filled with romantic tension that goes majorly awry.Act II, ""The Gold Watch,"" introduces us to aging boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) as Wallace asks him to throw an upcoming match. We also learn about Butch's father's lucky gold watch, a family heirloom with a crazy history. There's a noir aspect to this part of the story, as Butch of course decides not to throw the fight and run away with his girl (Maria de Madeiros), but the reckoning we expect takes a series of unbelievable turns. As we make sense of the chaos, notions of good vs. bad luck and good vs. evil — or bad vs. ****ing evil — start to appear, even as it plays for pulp entertainment.Act III, ""The Bonnie Situation,"" takes Jules and Vincent down a peg as they too get ""lucky"" but then must deal with a mistake that requires the help of a fixer named Wolf (Harvey Keitel). The whole ordeal has Jules contemplating the notion of divine intervention, and we begin to see all the events in the film as being either about luck, coincidence, divine intervention, or any other number of ways you can look at twists of fortune.By digging into the story and uncovering these deeper themes, Tarantino transforms everything else about the film from hollow pulp fiction to rich pulp fiction. He proves that meaning can come even from the perverted, salacious material. A notion of social responsibility even sneaks its way in by the end.As a director, Tarantino impressively wields suspense in the form of anticipated violence. It has remained his calling card ever since. Nobody can craft a modern day Mexican standoff like he seems to effortlessly do in every film. He also delivers on that anticipation of violence in a satisfying way. He goes big, but he never goes so far as to completely rip us out of this story.The greatest of great films always have unforgettable scenes that are somewhat inessential if not tangential to the story. Vincent and Mia twisting in the '50s-themed restaurant to Chuck Berry's ""You Never Can Tell;"" Christopher Walken's cameo relaying the story of the gold watch to a young Butch —Tarantino's creative choices really pop out, which happens when you've crafted an excellent story.Yet the literary quality that Tarantino brings to this curse-filled and violent film is it's crowning achievement. Even just the Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) scenes that bookend the film have so much to say about fate and free will, and the things that happen to Vincent whenever he takes a bathroom break with a pulp magazine seem to offer a meta-commentary on the entertaining distraction typically associated with these kinds of genre films.""Pulp Fiction"" really tore down walls for filmmakers exposed to and inspired by pulp and other ""lesser"" forms of entertainment who wanted to grow up and make art. It certainly gave Tarantino an audience to keep telling these kinds of stories. From spaghetti westerns to kung fu movies, he finds a depth and richness to them and channels that into his own storytelling. ""Pulp Fiction"" happens to be his finest example as well as one of his first.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
06/02/2003,8,"This is an awesome movie that has crime, thrill and comedy. You won't be bored even for a single minute in this 154 minute movie as the story is very interesting and entertaining. The story line is written in such a way that it prevents you to get out of your seat at any point of time. The four stories blend themselves in a very beautiful way that you have might have never seen before. Everyone did superb acting in the movie especially John Travolta and Bruce Willis. Quentin Tarantino has put in some ultimate dialogues in this movie that make the movie special.10 on 10 for this superb movie. Must watch for all!"
23/01/2003,8,"There may be numerous brilliant movies made in the 90ies (e.g. Heat, Terminator 2, The Shawshank Redemption, just to name a few), but this one isn't only the best of the decade but potentially the best movie ever made - and by far the one I was most fascinated from the very beginning. Containing a bunch of great Hollywood actors, one of the best sound tracks around and arguably the greatest dialogues such a movie could offer (e.g. the foot massage talk, Willis in the cab, all of Keitel's lines) this Tarantino work is simply a masterpiece. The cast is extraordinary, without exception. Pick Walken as the vet, Tarantino as the worried yet clarified husband (nearly unbelievable if you consider him playing the perverse, violent Richard Gecko two years later), Willis as the lucky boxer and so on. I can't help myself - reflecting about the movie just makes me adore it even more (if that's possible). Probably I just haven't seen it often enough to somehow satisfy me yearn for Pulp Fiction."
20/01/2003,8,"Controversy is usually good for movies. It's helped push movies to box office success just to see how bad they actually were, and I think that that is one of the ways Pulp Fiction has become so immensely popular. I've heard multiple people musing about the excessive violence, the drug use, the language, and more. So I really wanted to see Pulp Fiction beforehand, but curiosity piqued my interest. I have to say that all of the hype didn't really add anything. It wasn't very violent (or it could be that I'm just desensitized to violence, but besides one scene, I've seen worse on TV), the language just seemed to flow normally (or maybe it was because I had seen Bad Santa the day before and it had about the same concentration of language), and the drug usewell, I expected it for it is a movie about drug abusers.Pulp Fiction is less a complete movie than a series of interrelated stories, the most interesting of which is Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) as two gangsters who often have pointless conversations. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is a boxer who accidentally kills his opponent in the ring and then he realizes the thrill of killing people. Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) pays Butch to throw that fight, but when he kills the guy, Marcellus gets Jules and Vincent to whack him. Along the way, Vincent has to take Marcellus's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out, and along the way she OD's. Got all that?There is one thing that Tarantino can do that no one else I've seen can do efficiently. He can work with time so well that you don't even notice it. Christopher Nolan first tried it in Following, unsuccessfully, and then executed well in Memento. However, there, he held our hand throw it, while Tarantino just lets it rip and hopes we can figure it out for ourselves, which we can do. That adds to the already thick layer of coolness that is in Pulp Fiction. Each character is memorable, especially Jules, who quotes from the Bible right before killing someone. It's just a very hip experience.Pulp Fiction cheerfully takes clichés, chews them up, and spits them out in a whole new vein. Like what Kill Bill did in the beginning, with the retro opening to set the mood, Pulp Fiction is halfway between an homage to gangster films and parody. Also, it's a trendsetter. The classic dance scene between Vincent and Mia at Jack Rabbit Slim's (which is a parody of all of those stupid throwback restaurants) has been parodied itself, as has the scene where Vincent and Jules are talking about McDonalds' Quarter Pounders.In addition to the layer of coolness, Pulp Fiction also has a lot of humor in it, much of it at times when you know you shouldn't laugh but you do, and also out of situations that you wouldn't laugh at usually. I'm sure some of the parts I laughed at were just because I wasn't expecting something to happen, or maybe I just have a morbid mind, but a lot of the humor came out of the violence.Everyone in the cast had amazing chemistry with each other, which added believability to a somewhat unbelievable story. The only reason that Pulp Fiction did not get a perfect score is that one scene with Butch and a cab driver went on for too long and did little to service the plot. Knowing me, though, I'll soon change the rating, but it can still be said that Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential movies of the 1990's.My rating: 9/10Rated R for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language and some sexuality."
17/01/2003,8,"Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest crime stories ever told on screen and portrayed by great actor including Travolta and Jackson. This movie had high expectations after Reservoir Dogs. It did not only live up to those expectations but went above and beyond. It is told by one of the greatest directors of our history with a stylish and violent twist that everyone likes in a while. This movie has everything a perfect movie should have, guns, death, betrayal, and love. This movie keep me pumped the whole way down the road. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a violent and a great story with excellent attitude. It could not have done any better then it was I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
16/01/2003,8,"The most fantastic movie I've seen, its going to be considered classic even 100yrs from now. A must watch cult movie that can teach actors and filmmakers the real way to make great art. I have watched this movie tons of times, and each time i watch it i get more in depth of what things actually meant. Also ""Reservoir of Dogs"" is very recommended. One of my most favorite movies of all. I am a big fan of filmmaking in general and its very important to watch classics to really put yourself in the mind of the filmmakers at the times when action and horror movies hasn't yet trashed Hollywood. Have Fun watching and Happy Journey!"
15/01/2003,8,"If I don't mistake, I have seen this movie 11 times! Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie. Every scenes have good feeling and make your day. The storyline, the scenes, the rolls, everything is excellent. A masterpiece of Quentin Tarantino."
11/01/2003,8,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerPulp Fiction is a film that must be seen. The story is cleverly put together and elegantly flows from character to character. The story is funny, brutal, disturbing, and memorable. The story is told in a nonlinear fashion and requires the audience to pay attention. Tarantino has created some of the most complex characters in cinema. They all have personality and are relatable in various ways. The dialogue between the characters is amazing. The ending is stunning.The acting is very good. Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Amanda Plummer, and Ving Rhames all perform extremely well. They all give their characters a certain flair and keep the story going with their individuality.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is justified because Tarantino builds his story and characters slowly.The amount of cursing in this film is, in my opinion, unneeded. I found the extent of the swearing excessive. The use of violence is perfect though.Pros: Elegantly told story full of memorable moments, a lot of funny moments, amazing characters, great dialogue, amazing acting, perfect pacing, and a good use of violenceCons: Excessive cursing and the runtime can be long for someOverall Rating: 9.1P.S. Pulp Fiction is a classic that should be experienced by all movie watchers. I would recommend being over the age of 18 because there are a lot of sexual situations and dialogue."
10/01/2003,8,It was long ago that I've seen the movie but i remembered it was a unique movie! all the different stories that broke the old line of a movie make you thin outside of the box!
08/01/2003,9,"Im no film buff, Im not a media student or a person that's able to watch a film and have any clue what goes on behind the scenes and what needs to happen pre production to make a film pop, but sweet holy Mary! I have never watched a film like this before and I am simply spellbound. What a cultural reset this must have been for film making. Tarantino shines too bright for this world man!"
30/12/2002,8,"This is one of those movies (like ""Fargo"") which expects the audience to laugh about the most cruel scenes of violence. That's not only disgusting but even dangerous, because in spite of ""It's only a movie, you know"" we all should know how influential screen behaviour might be, don't we?"
27/12/2002,8,Very well made movie great acting there were many different plot twists and turns in the movie. I personally myself did not like the movie I thought it was very dull and to not make sense at times many other people find it amazing and a great movie but that is why we all have different tastes and likes when it comes down to movies music Exedra. The director of this film is usually not one of my favorite that could possibly be why I do not enjoy the movie as much as other people have it was a well made movie with lots of great acting and lots of famous actors and actresses. A lot of the story just made no sense to me on why they would do certain things or why they were acting in certain ways that they were like I said this movie was not for me but I know many people out there have really enjoyed it throughout the years.
26/12/2002,8,"""Pulp Fiction"" often stands as a touchstone in cinematic history, but many feel that its acclaim is more a product of hype than genuine artistic merit. While Quentin Tarantino's film is undoubtedly stylish, some critics argue that its layers of complexity can sometimes feel like an elaborate smokescreen for deeper issues.I think that this movie is simply overrated. I am not saying its a bad movie but it is an overkill. I liked the writing and the actors did a magnificent job conveying their roles that's it. I believe the buzz over this movie is too much and to be honest left me disappointed and betrayed after watching it, i was expecting.In summary, while ""Pulp Fiction"" has certainly left a mark on cinema, its storytelling style, dialogue, portrayal of violence, and cultural prominence can lead some to view it as overrated rather than the iconic film it is often considered for me personally."
24/12/2002,8,"Well directed, well produced, love the photography, and the script is amazing. Quentin Tarantino is one of my preferred directors, and the Pulp Fiction was the first film from Tarantino that made me start looking different for this director's work. The arc of this script is super well created, once the story connects all the scenes and characters in an order which makes you get into the movie. The photography of this movie is also amazing, very well planned in a way which brings all the atmosphere of the entire movie. The characters are amazing super well acted by this super list of cast. About Tarantino's direction, there nothing that I can tell ... in my opinion this guy is a genius with enough sensibility to put the audience on the right climax, at the right moment. One of the best movies I have ever seen."
23/12/2002,7,The movie was weird and was like a genre of its own . But it was weirdly fun to watch it and I had a great time and a great laugh from the movie . Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta were at their best ..
23/12/2002,7,"I must admit that I'm a little disappointed in myself for not having seen Pulp Fiction until very recently. It's something that I've always been meaning to watch, and you can never really go wrong with Quentin Tarantino. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is legendary, and although I am not a huge fan of John Travolta, I really enjoyed his performance as well. I absolutely loved the style of this film. The dialogue is so smooth and natural, and the way the different story lines intertwine just makes this movie that much more interesting and enjoyable. All of these little elements come together to produce a truly great film, one that I could watch over and over. Pulp Fiction is certainly a must see for everyone, whether you're a film buff or not."
18/12/2002,7,"Yes, that's right. Crap. This film is just that. If you take a closer look at f.ex. Bruce Willis, who seems to make people scream their head off every time he's near the screen, you can clearly see that this person lacks personality. He has two expressions: One that says ON, (with a little wrinkle above his nose) the other is of course OFF, when he's asleep. a machine of a man, which perhaps cries a bit when he comes home, because he's in desperate need for a personality, some feelings, a higher IQ and an even bigger paycheck.Why this person has become so popular has to do with you mindless people out there. Voting, cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors, musicians, artists etc. That is why this world goes straight down the toilette. Making your modern remarks that everything is so ""Cool"" all the time.Pulp Fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director. There is no inventions, no good or natural acting, no deeper meaning with this movie at all. Just exploitation.The era of good movie-productions are long gone. Classic actor's like Chaplin, Bogart, Cooper, Peck, Holden and Quinn don't get born any more. Today it's just you gray and unpersonalized people out there (With some exceptions), watching to see if there's something that can kill your brain even more, with splatter and gore above your ears. Yeah, you're a really ""cool"" bunch, drowning on dry land."
02/12/2002,7,"I have been putting off watching this movie for years now and today I went to a second-hand store and bought it for a Euro and fifty cents. It was a DVD and therefore the quality wasn't great and since it was a relatively old DVD, I could only watch the English version with subtitles in German, which were a true pain in the ass. Despite my incredibly high expectations and annoyance as a result of the huge subtitles on my screen, I think it's safe to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. It feels so natural, every pretentious person saying the dialogue in this movie is extraordinary and that's what makes it great, is, as it turns out, right! I have never seen such a chaotic mess of a movie, so beautifully and harmonically made. Truly a great experience, even for me, who randomly decided to pick it up and watch it on my couch."
30/11/2002,10,"Decent movie with an interesting story but very long and sometimes boring. It had trouble keeping my interest at times. And I also found the nonlinear storytelling very unnecessary and it didn't add anything to the movie. Completely dialogue-based, which is not normally my thing even though a lot of the dialogue was very good. Some very memorable moments. all star cast with some great performances (2 viewings)"
17/11/2002,10,"Best movie for any filmmaker to watch. This movie shows the power of filmmaking.The storyline and dialogue are amazing.Everything in each scene, the mis en scene, is impeccable.Color and cinematography are extremely good.The actors gave some of their best performances in their careers.It is edgy and ground breaking.Started a whole new way to make movies, and revitalized the art of making movies.Essential for every filmmaker to watch.Steeped in a deep understanding of film history.Work of a true artist."
10/11/2002,9,"Straight up this is my favourite movie of all time for too many reasons, starting from the performances, the cast, to the plot. I wish I could turn back time to watch this movie for the first time. Quentin is genius, some dialogues of the movie are lengthy yet so interesting, every scene is a masterpiece, the dancing scene is iconic, Uma Thurman didn't know how to dance and she was improvising but she absolutely nailed it. I don't know how Samuel L. Jackson didn't win the Oscars for his role. The fact that the movie's budget was 8 million USD is very interesting, and nobody can make a great movie with this budget except the one and only Quentin Tarantino. If you have not watched this movie yet, you are so lucky and honestly I envy you."
03/11/2002,10,"Well I just saw Kill Bill, and I became a big Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman fan.  So I heard a lot about this movie, and I bought it.. at first I didn't get it very well because I had no idea what it was about, I never heard about the plot or anything, (yeah, this movie is like 10 years old and I saw it a couple of weeks ago).  Anyways I was so glad I bought it! I even bought the soundtrack, it's just so good!  it's amazing how Quentin Tarantino has a natural skill to tell a story that, if someone else would have told it, it would be dead boring or just stupid..  I noticed that in both Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, all the dialogues are absolutely necessaries!  You won't see stupid phrases like in horror movies when the killer is approaching and they say ""ruuuun!"" d'oh! of course u have to run, there's no need to say it!!-  here, if you take away one single dialogue, the whole thing falls apart.So the casting is perfect, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, etc... they were all great, the careers of all these actors turned to a different direction after this movie, for good of course, for all of them (especially Travolta who was dead for Hollywood and thanks to this movie he's still around).  Also Harvey Keitel, even his character didn't have a lot of screentime, he did great, he's my favorite. 
Well the music is perfect, it fits every single scene (special mention to that song ""you'll be a woman soon""), etc...  Well it's a great movie, and it's definitely right to be #16 in the list and no wonder why it won the best picture at the Cannes festival back in 1994, TWO THUMBS WAAAY UP!"
31/10/2002,10,"I'm a guy who loves movies, and I have very high standards for the movies I watch. When I first saw this movie a few months ago, I REALLY liked it. But when I bought the special edition, and watched it a second time, it was almost like the second time was better. I love this movie and highly recommend it, for no other movie will ever surpass this movie as the greatest movie to ever grace the planet earth. Like seriously, if you haven't seen this movie and you're just now reading this review, you now have a responsibility to go out, get some good snack food, buy Pulp Fiction and a really nice TV, and watch it. Greatest movie ever. Peace."
23/10/2002,10,"I like the soundtrack of this movie. I wish I watched this movie back in 70's when I was working hard in Japan. This could change your mind to see the things. I also like this director's other films. They are all worth watching and the soundtracks are also great, for sure.I like the soundtrack of this movie.

22/10/2002,10,"Regardless of what great actors and actresses were in this movie, I found it to be very repulsive.  The dungeon scene was something that should have been shown on Mississippi burning only they had the decency not to go there. All in all this movie was difficult to follow and I consider myself an intelligent person.  Violence and filthy language taken to an extreme is how I would characterize this one."
18/10/2002,10,"If you are looking for Characters with flaws (and a lotta them) that make you feel better about yourself then this is the movie for you.Very fine characters with very interesting interactions make for a movie that explores relationships of all kinds (boss vs employee, lovers, friends) make this a relatable violent flick for kids of all ages above the age of 21+ (haha)"
17/10/2002,10,"I watched Pulp Fiction at least a dozen times, and imo this is Quentin Tarantino's best, sadly he never reached that kind of masterclass again. The dance of Uma Thurman and John Travolta of course is iconic, the rest of the cast just supberb, the story told fantastic and unconventional.For sure, one of the finest moments of the 90s regarding movie-making."
11/10/2002,10,"Because of the advance publicity, a few posters and an all-star lineup of actors; we planned to see Pulp Fiction as soon as it came out. I took my sister to see this movie on opening day in College Station, TX. The theater charged ""premium"" rates for the show, the two tickets cost me $70. What a mistake. It was so boring that we walked out after approximately 30 minutes and went for drinks instead. The only redeeming point to the evening was that I only wasted 30 minutes and $70 - I can at least cling to not having wasted several hours.This movie? Ignore the comments made by people who want to pretend they didn't get taken - save your cash and see something entertaining."
11/10/2002,10,"this is a film that gets better and better each time you see it, the dialogue is just superb, its funny, clever and realistic, the film is set around different groups of people and each character puts in a performance, nobody lets the film down. Even if their role is only small, they still do the job.the cinematography is inspiring, as a student it really makes me want to go out with a camera and film, the shots are clever and effective, just a beauty to watch.the soundtrack is one of the best iv heard in a film, every song fits.I'm not going to spoil the film or go in to much detail but it is a film you have to see, once, twice, or a hundred times..."
10/10/2002,10,"From the very beginning you are drawn into the movie with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, who by the way have wonderful chemistry on screen, debating whether a foot massage is considered cheating. An all star cast consisting of the aforementioned Jackson and Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames really give this movie a dimension unknown to film making today. Quentin Tarantino's style of extraordinary dialogue, and his ability to make even the most grotesque scenes comical is pure genius. However, the real beauty in this movie is the soundtrack. Unlike some of the more mainstream films today, Quentin isn't concerned with bringing a certain demographic through the doors by choosing modern music that researchers believe will appeal to that demographic; he actually chooses music appropriate to the movie. Quentin Tarantino's best movie to date."
09/10/2002,10,"Brilliant, amazing, incredible. Just a few words to describe this movie. The direction, camera work is all near perfect and the acting in the movie is superb. It has an excellent beginning in the café robbery scene and the way the movie comes together for each characters own story is brilliantly done. I thought the talk in the car with Jules and Vincent was a brilliant piece of script writing on Tarantino's behalf. The way that so much tension was built up in some scenes was excellent, for example the scene in the guy's apartment at the start was brilliant as we new that they were going to kill him but because it went on for so long with Jules acting so calm gave it's audience an edgy feeling and the brilliant idea to give Jules something to say from the bible before he kills somebody was nothing short of a brilliant idea. Tarantino's work for this movie was brilliant and I have read the script of this movie 3 times and still cannot believe the brilliance of it."
08/10/2002,10,"Pulp Fiction is a 3 story movie about crime, betrayal, and karma. Directed by the famous and clever Quentin Tarrantino, the film contains memorable phrases and a well developed script, also written by Tarrantino. The movie has brilliant ideas, and is filled with symbolism. While most of the symbolism is subtle, there are a couple instances where it is discussed, even by the actors in the actual movie. The motion picture contains an all star cast, with a wide variety of acting styles. This is a film for any person, no matter what their movie preference is. What completes the movie, is the fact that any movie watcher will consider the film for days, years, it even could stick with them for the rest of their lives."
06/10/2002,10,"If you've heard it once you've heard it before but pulp fiction is an example of great filmmaking. It really is Tarantino's best movie and one of his masterpieces. From start to finish it is a smart, charming, well-constructed and fun ride. Everything about this movie works on every level. The writing is incredible with monologues with so many quotable lines that about controversial topics without feeling too preachy. The acting is flawless; you can't get more perfect with this casting everyone gives an Oscar worthy performance. Every second of this film you are glued to the screen. This movie is able to have both violence and humor in it without ever taking away from it. The film is the blueprint to how to make a love letter to movies. Some thing I feel Tarantino knows how to do very well."
23/09/2002,10,"Perhaps I am the last one on planet Earth to see this film. I used to think that Tarantino is arrogant and over-rated, but after seeing this I regret all I said. This film is a masterpiece. Like Godfather, it's very rare to find a gangster movie script that puts all this concentration on characters and not the plot. The characters are alive.. full of controversies.. They r real life people. The girl who commits an armed robbery feels desire to pee.. The hit men talking about Hamburger on their way to the kill.. the finding that U have to wash a car with detergents after blowing the brains of a man... The hustle U cause for a drug dealer when trying to inject intra-cardiac adrenaline. This is charming. U don't give a damn about the plot.. Who cares ?... the dialog should be taught in film schools since U can't miss a single word .. They talk about milk shake and Ice cream, but U feel it's more interesting than talking about cocaine and dead gangsters. Everybody is superb.. U can never forget Thurman, Travolta or Jackson.. Even Tarantino's role is very amusing. This genre is a genuine mixture between film Noir and comedy.. I think I must see ""Kill Bill"" once more, for I didn't like it at first time."
22/09/2002,10,"This movie is somewhat overrated. 
People generally seem to like this movie but they're doing it all wrong. I feel like people's comments about this movie, such as; ""it's a masterpiece"", ""this movie was great"" and Bruce Willis has a great butt"" are somewhat unfounded, lack basic arguments, scientific reesearch and should be directed towards more epic pieces of the cinematic history. Examples of such pieces would be; Mad Max: Fury Road and/or other movies that are completely perfect. We should be careful of throwing out such compliments toward overrated historic innacuracies such as Pulp Fiction and Schindlers List.
It is a good movie and it has alot of good qualities, but the main quality it has is that its overrated. Its not the best quality but it feels like its a fitting one, it being overrated that is.
Maybe one day Tarantino will make a sequel to this one (and maybe call it Pulp Fiction: Rise of the Gimp or maybe Pulp Fiction 2: Uma Thurman Unchained or even Pulp Fiction: Everybody be cool this is a Robbery) that won't be as overrated, but it feels unlikely since he is making perfect western movies at the moment that are completely UNDERrated.
To summarize, this movie is overrated and it will probably stay that way for a long time."
02/09/2002,10,well on a personal note i would not pay attention to george parker as he must not have taste in good films. the film pulp fiction was a sceptical for many films today including the way actors flame at each other and use violence. the film is three stories in one all based around a different group of people. tarantino used his own style of movie making and like all of his films has the middle at the start and end the beginning at the start and the end played throughout. this gives us a brief idea of everything that is happening that day instead of going backwards and forwards and losing the plot. i recommend this film to any great film watcher and give it 5/5stars *****
01/09/2002,10,"I really can't believe that such good actors like John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth and Ving Rhames have accepted to play this non-sense movie!!! And I also can't believe that Quentin Tarantino has created such ""no head"" and ""no feet"" film...When I saw it, I got very disappointed, because, before watching it, I had seen ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Jackie Brown"", two extraordinary films, so, I thought that I was going to find a similar film here...but, unfortunately, I did not..."
25/08/2002,7,"Every plot is tense and frightening. The story seems to have nothing to do with it, but it's closely related. But in this way, the narrative mode of the movie story that is abused by the directors and reached the degree of abuse is really a good movie. There are many questions about it, and it doesn't seem to have much feeling."
18/08/2002,6,"For those who appreciate great films, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a must see. The movie is Tarantino's 2nd work after having great success with his gangster story of ""Reservoir Dogs"". There are many unique aspects of Pulp Fiction that make it so good. As many of you know, Tarantino's use of dialogue that he gives the characters in his films is excellent, humorous, and intelligent. Pulp Fiction is by far his best in this aspect. From conversations talking about foot massages to talking about filthy animals; PF has the best dialogue of any movie I have ever seen. The movie is shuffled in a way that it tells the story out of sequence, once again a redundant aspect in most Tarantino films. This influenced many different mob films, but no other movie will ever be as great as Pulp Fiction. Film making at its finest.$$$"
13/08/2002,6,"Everything from themes, to dialog, to underlying storyline is a modern-day classic. One can watch this movie 10 times and come away with some new perspectives each and every time. Even the music is totally engrossing. SEE THIS MOVIE!A one time viewing is not enough. It's like an onion. Each viewing peels another level. And each new level reveals insights you didn't notice before. The film strikes deep emotions and introspective tones without being overly intellectual. You never feel like your sitting in a literature class, but nonetheless you find yourself diving deep into the characters.Most remarkably, it does all of this ""Deep Thinking"" while keeping a wonderful sense of humor. It's a real trick to be exploring these engaging powerful (and even violent) characters and yet keep you laughing too!Bottom line, it's like a 10 course meal with all different flavored levels that still manages to keep the watcher wanting more.A modern masterpiece!"
02/08/2002,6,"This film is something that has to be seen by anyone who is into cinema. For me, the most interesting part about it is definitely the masterful dialogue, along with the compelling and provocative performances delivered by amazing actors, playing memorable characters. The dialogue is witty and entertaining, it often seems like all of the scenes in which the characters are conversing aren't really moving the plot forward, but they provide a ton of room for character development. You really feel like you're getting a glimpse into very lifelike, honest interactions between the characters, there is a sense of flow, a sense of realism."
02/08/2002,6,"There isn't a single normal person in Pulp Fiction. Not a one. And that is what makes the film so memorable. There a ton of things going on, including a bizarre couple robbing a diner, a couple of hit men avenging a rip off of a mobster boss, a boxer who is supposed to take a dive but doesn't, and a mobster's wife being entertained by one of the hit men.I admit it. I saw Pulp Fiction for the first time a couple of nights ago. Why it took me 17 years to see this very special movie is known only to God. To think I could have spent all these years seeing this movie countless times, like I do The Godfather, Casino, GoodFellas, and Love Actually is a bit disappointing. But at least I've seen it now, and now I understand what all the fuss has been all these years.John Travolta made his comeback with his performance as one of the loopy hit men, and deservedly so. He is off kilter enough to be interesting but not so extreme as to be insane. He just kills in his worldly sort of way. Samuel L. Jackson, a killer who obsesses about sin and absolution, is his partner. Uma Thurman is the mobster's wife who Travolta's character is supposed to entertain. Take a look at Steve Buscemi as their waiter. Directed brilliantly by Quentin Tarantino, all of the performances are memorable. The list of stars who shine in this movie are as endless as the subplots that they play in; Ms. Thurman, Messers Travolta and Jackson, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, and Harvey Keitel. Keitel's ability to play twisted in such a straight sort of way is astonishing.The dialog in this film is classic, as I was warned it would be. I was enthralled with the well crafted dialog that comes out of the actors so seemingly effortlessly, and with such entertaining effect.Everyone who sees this film will interpret its meaning differently, especially the ending. As for me, I will never use the bathroom when I am supposed to be knocking off a double crossing boxer.And remember, ""Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character."""
26/07/2002,9,"PULP FICTION is a masterpiece from start to finish. A couple of hard boiled stories, are waved together by only such perfection as Tarantino.Now, I'm not going to say that Big Q is my favorite director, but there is no doubt that the man is a genius. Just look at the script! And, just as in his other masterpiece RESERVOIR DOGS, the scenes and scenarios are harshly mixed up in one big mess. As a director, well, he's good but not that very original, with some exceptions like the PULP-dancesceen and the ending in DOGS. His real magnificent lies in this adrenalin rush script. It is genius!!!PULP FICTION is my second favorite after STAR WARS (I'm not sure why I love that film, but hey, sue me) and it can't be compared to the rest of my top-movies, nor Tarantino's others. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a big flat joke to this, also NATURAL BORN KILLERS (Tarantino's story) and probably TRUE ROMANCE too. JACKIE BROWN is a good film, but it's one million floors down from this movie. The nearest so far is RESERVOIR DOGS. The direction of DOGS was better than PULP, but PULP FICTION has got this screenplay that no other (and I do mean NOT ONE) has got.Let's go on to... acting. Well, I'll put it like this: A majority of the actors do their best roles ever, here is my PULP FICTION ACTING-GUIDE: TRAVOLTA: Definitely his best role so far. His portrait of VINCE is a classic. It's cool, funny and you just smile by satisfaction while he slither around mrs.Wallace's house. And the dancing-scene is also notable. Here we see that Travolta's dancing king age is still not over.JACKSON: It's a hard choice, but I'm pretty certain that this is his best performance I've seen. He's around everywhere, so it's tough but he tops. Still, it's easier concidering the fact that his performance is THE BEST IN THE MOVIE! The path of the ritcheus man is to be set on all sides... THURMAN: I have never been such a tremendous fan of Uma Thurman, but this time wer'e talking COOL CHICK. It is a shame that she's only in like 1/5 of the movie. We should see more of her. KEITEL: No, mr.Wolf isn't his best. I'm rooting for mr.White or the priest in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. I know, it's a crap movie but the role is good. ROTH: Yeah, mr.Orange is better, but this one is on a good 2'nd place. RHAMES: His best role! Without a doubt. MARCELLUS WALLACE wer'e talking respect here. I'M GONNA GET MEDEVIL ON YOUR ASS!!!!!! He is one tough bastard. His scene with Willis was great, and every other scene he was into in this great, great movie. ARQUETTE: She isn't in this movie that much, but it is by far her best performance. STOLTZ: Eric Stoltz is a great actor, and I think every part he ever played is the best, and I'm sorry that he's not in this one that much. WILLIS: Bruce Willis might do his best performance, and the most quality-role but I have a very hard time if I'll ever try to forget JOHN McCLANE. This is his second best role.Well, let's not forget about ERIC ROBERTS and QUENTIN TARANTINO. Or should we? Yes, actually but let's try to focus on these two gentlemens too. Ok Roberts, everybody's hate victim and the biggest C-actor since DOLPH LUNDGREN. And Tarantino might be a groovy director/writor but he actually is quite pale as an actor.PULP FICTION has also got BLOOD and VIOLENCE. It is a strong, foulmouth and shocking but also classic movie. If you really loved RESERVOIR DOGS... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? I can guarantee (yes, I can make out a promise, sue me if this is wrong) that you'll at least like this movie.ALSO: Great sound and cool soundtrack. I first saw this movie four years ago, and it is still just as great.Overall 10/10"
11/07/2002,9,"Saw this movie looong after it was released! Saw this movie not 1 but 2 or 3 times, but as they say ""You don't have to watch a movie 1000 times so you can make a clear impression of it, 1 time you must enjoy it and 2 time(if you liked it) analyze and enjoy it!""1) Action Action in this movie is very well put! It's not like in all the other movies where 1 or 2 heroes of the regular movie kill numerous quantity of people and then ""Save de Girl!"" And that's a very good start if you ask me! They kill for reason! They kill because they know this is the right thing to do! They kill because they haven't got another choice!2) Story An interesting story of 1-11 heroes is shown in this movie! If you saw this movie right amount of time you would say that almost every person shown in this movie has his own story.3) Chapters Movie is separated into chapters! Not only that but it's also distributed chaotically, so you have to decide from where it all starts and where it ends! Offcourse this movie has many endings: For some people unfortunate and some people fortunate endings!4) Conversations Conversations is the capital letter in this movie. People say that characters talk too much, but they don't say that they talk about nothing, because they don't and that is the exact point!5) Cast All the actors did quite surprisingly well in this movie! I would say that they've done their best, сertainly not for the money but for us to enjoy and so we did, do and will be!The Bottom Line is ""If you have spare cash and you have spare time go buy this movie and enjoy it as much as you can!"""
02/07/2002,9,"Although this film has received very high critical acclaims worldwide, but it's still not as well-known as it deserved. Maybe it's too much of a film Noir follower, but even after i finished a short Noir course, I can't commit myself to agree that Noir is that big a deal. Pulp Fiction is so perfectly done on almost(I haven't found one yet today!) all perspectives in a film production. How can it not as well known as Stars War?...I must be silly. ""If you haven't watched 'A Clockwork Orange' yet, you are shame to say you'd watch a movie before...""--this was an advertisement title i seen to introduce this amazing movie, and today, I'll say: ""If you haven't watched 'Pulp Fiction' yet, you are shame to say you'd watched movies in the 90s""."
29/06/2002,9,"Tarantino is the best. No one can touch his style of mixing the story line up. This is my all time favorite movie. I once heard someone say there was so much violence in the movie and so many deaths. I countered and said ""There's less than ten deaths."" You only see about seven people die and it's not gun to the head, it's like when Bruce Willis cuts the guy with the sword it's with the other's guys back to us so we don't see a whole lot, just a red line across his stomach after wards.I like what Samuel L. said about the movie. ""It's not about death, but rather redemption."" I personally think this movie is semi-religious. Well it has a lot of religious symbolism, even though there is no allegory like John Travolta, for example, is God. It's not like that. There are three main stories, seven deaths, and everyone is given a second chance to change their life."
29/06/2002,9,"Pulp: a magazine or book printed on cheap paper (as newsprint) and often dealing with sensational material, Fiction: something invented by the imagination or feigned; specifically : an invented story b : fic This is my favorite film ever, and for many reasons...""and you will know my name is the Lord when i lay my vengeance on them"".. (gunshots)Is a very innovative film, the characters are L.A gangsters, (except for the Butch character who is a boxer running away from the gangsters), but very likable and with a lot of personality.The way they have different stories but at the end all stories go together, the dialogues, the quotes, even the soundtrack.. anyway, this is the best movie ever made, very original an clever and with an unique style, definitely it should win an Oscar. 10/10"
25/06/2002,9,"Now I know when you read the title of my review you may think it's such an oxymoron but it's exactly what it says: Pulp Fiction is a awesome and brilliant and smart film but it's overrated. People like to toss the word ""overrated"" as if it's a synonym for ""bad"" but it just means something is being valued more than it should be. In other words, I don't think Pulp Fiction is 8.9 great but like an 8.1-8.3 kind of great.Pulp Fiction with its witty dialogues, non-linear structure of storytelling, entertaining moments and characters, subtle details in screenwriting are not enough to convince me that it is 8.9 good. And I've watched and studied this film as much angles and layers as a film student could and still fail to see why it is 8.9 and is on par with The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, 12 Angry Men, Schindler's List, and The Dark Knight - all of which are titanic achievements in cinema.But don't let those dilute you to think I think this film sucks, like I said it deserves probably 8.1 to 8.3 at the most. So I will lay out why I think Pulp Fiction is still great.The witty dialogues: Quentin Tarantino easily stands among legendary screenwriters such as Aaron Sorkin, Eric Roth, Tom McCarthy, etc. in terms of dialogue writings. They are smart, entertaining, engaging. How Tarantino wrote the diner scene where Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace was spending an entire minute of screen time ordering the food and still keep the audience intrigued: this is because he uses exotic terms for the food and uses the character's reaction to those exotic names. That's how to make it interesting.Furthermore, it adds such smart details into the plot for example the fact that Butch and Marsellus spent minutes agreeing that Butch should throw his fight only to be sabotaged in under 30 seconds after Butch interacts with Vincent Vega. Vince calling Butch a ""palooka"" and ""punchy"" (both are affronts to a boxer, more than that, a person with a warrior complex like Butch), then Butch sees that Vince and Marsellus are good friends hugging each other. This crucial 30 seconds change the plot forever, causing Butch to not throw the fight and the lives of him, Marsellus, and Vincent Vega to be subsequently changed forever. This was such smart writing.Of course, the entertainment in this film is such thrilling: the OD of Mia Wallace and the anticipation on whether the situation can be salvaged; the rape scene and how our characters overcome that in a satisfying way; Samuel Jackson's character Jules' wittily intimidating lowkey comedic dialogues.and the diner robbery then the showdown between Pumpkin and Jules is such breathtaking. Then of course, the iconic Pulp Fiction dance, what can I say?Pulp Fiction's message hidden in hindsight is ultimately that of redemption or choosing the right path for life. For Mia Wallace, she chose the druggie life only to be end up on the verge of death, after the morbid experience we can see her soften somehow. Maybe then she will turn to righteousness and redemption. Next, Butch's family background were all warriors which is why he chooses to be a boxer but then the warrior element doesn't come in until he made decision on whether to save Marsellus Wallace his enemy or not from the degenerate hillbillies. Which is why he chose a Samurai sword out of all things. Finally, Jules' arc is that he realizes he only survive an ordeal through ""divine intervention"" and deliberate that this is a sign and if he doesn't stop being a proxy in this business now then more a dire fate may ensue upon him. Hence why he shows mercy to Pumpkin a diner robber and he rethinks the interpretation of his Bible verse.Overall, we can see the source for a person's switch to righteousness doesn't just come from religion (which is what most people think because they only focus on Jules' arc), but it comes from many things: a brush with mortality (Mia Wallace), family values (Butch), salvation from a foe (Marsellus Wallace), and faith (Jules). The only character who was not enlighten to this revelation was Vincent Vega because his lifestyle is too deeply embedded in this criminal and toxic underworld. Furthermore, he's too absent-minded and too shallow to comprehend a deeper deliberation in life as Jules. Hence why he does not buy into Jules' interpretation of divine intervention.The dialogue writting of Tarantino is just like his plot writing: it starts with one point then spirals into a whole different place in a way that is entertaining. This is because real life dialogues and real life events are exactly the same. This is why Tarantino's writing is so great. And overall, Pulp Fiction is great is awesome is smart and easily win a place in my top 30. But of course, as I said, I still don't get and probably never will understand why it is 8.9 and is top 6 of the best film ever made despite of how much I said I love it above and the many explanations and readings of this film that I have read."
21/06/2002,9,"I could rant and rave about this film for pages, but that would be pointless.  Just SEE IT, it is that simple.  Brilliant nonlinear story-telling.  The payoff is technically in the middle of the story, but at the end of the movie (robbery scene).  Though in my opinion, not as clever as Reservoir Dogs, the story telling is genius and that it why it won Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary the academy award for best original screenplay."
19/06/2002,9,"Pulp Fiction is phenomenal on so many different levels. Quentin Tarantino is a truly talented director that goes to no end to make his films powerful beyond belief. Pulp Fiction is just one example of the many great ones. The moment you turn on Pulp Fiction, you know you're in for quite a ride. This film has all the necessary components to make it exciting, gangsters, fights, drug conflicts, etc. This movie is so mind bending because of all the twists and turns and chapters it takes you on. To say this movie is complicated would be an understatement, but when you're finished watching it, you are left sitting there thinking how amazing it actually is. Thurman, Travolta, and Jackson are just a few names whose acting make this movie what it is. You haven't seen a great movie until you've watched Pulp Fiction."
06/06/2002,9,"I saw Pulp Fiction for the first time in 2004.  I hope that's the reason why I don't think this is the great modern classic that everybody else does. However, 1994 was not that long ago.  Movies have not changed that much in the last 10 years.  All I heard about Pulp Fiction for years was how violent it was.  I'm sorry, it really just wasn't.  The supposedly brilliant and original characters in this movie don't really seem brilliant or original to me.  There all just kind of losers.  They're just losers in that glorified Tarantino way.  I thought both Kill Bills were much better than this movie.Finally, let me say that just because a movie jumps around between stories and characters does not automatically make it a good movie."
02/06/2002,9,"There is no doubt that this is one of the best films of all time. I wasn't expecting it to be so good. I was just expecting just another gangster movie, but it is so much more than that. The way it all comes together at the end and how all the stories are planned out is so unique and brilliant.The acting was also superb. Great performances form both John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. I have to say I have never heard so many uses of the F**k word in one movie before! Lol. But it is also a funny film which I wasn't actually expecting. It doesn't say on IMDb as a comedy film but I think it should be put in as one of the genres of the film.I would recommend this film to anyone. Alhough if your easily offended this film is actually an 18 for a very good reason. But overall, brilliant movie. 10/10"
17/05/2002,1,This movie is such a masterpiece for many reasons. The way everything connects makes it really important for you to pay attention. Lots of action and very funny. It also has a really good balance of everything you look for in a movie.
13/05/2002,1,"The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy."
06/05/2002,1,I heard so many people claim that this movie is a masterpiece and it also has high ratings. So I was intrigued to give it a go. I didn't get much enjoyment out of it. Maybe you have to watch it multiple times to enjoy it. As for the first viewing it didn't satisfy me.
12/04/2002,4,"Pulp Fiction is mildly amusing in parts, and in all honesty relies completely on the scene that makes the movie, from where Bruce Willis walks past the clothesline to where he makes up with the hilarious crime boss. Much like the log scene makes a King Kong movie. The scenes with Willis are livelier than the scenes with the two dull, obnoxious hit men who get way too much screen time, and put the viewer to sleep. The surface plot of this movie is pretty dull, and it's tough to care with the poorly written characters, but it relies on its ""iconic"" style of trash talk and actions. The hidden plot of this movie is the title itself of ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie has mixed allusions to different eras. Sometimes, it is the late eighties and early nineties, but more often it is the late sixties, early seventies, with the rotary phones, clothes lines, rarity of billboards, and the songs people tapped fingers to in those days. What we have is essentially a make believe world in which kids from the seventies think the world is like outside, where everyone carries a gun and is either a boxer, gangster, killer, or lunatic. The ""modern"" images are all imagined by the seventies kids thinking they'll be in such a world when they grow up. A decent idea, but it could have been done better with more interesting hit men. The Bruce Willis character, and his performance, help salvage this, though."
03/04/2002,5,"I never thought it'd happen. I've seen a lot of movies. I've given a lot of high ratings. I've never before seen fit to give a movie a ten, though. But I could find not a single thing wrong with this movie.I avoided Quentin Tarantino's movies ever since I saw my first one, which was Kill Bill. I thought it was appalling - the storyline has been done before, the violence was over the top, the gore was stupid, the acting was shocking, and we won't even go into my dislike for Uma Thurman here. I was persuaded to watch both this movie and Reservoir Dogs by my best mate, and after much reluctance I finally acquiesced. And thank all the Gods I did.This manages to be one of the most violent, brutal movies ever produced. However, in a complete paradox to the statement I just made, there is next to no violence in the movie - it runs, much like Reservoir Dogs (but not to the same extent) off the witty and intelligent dialogue, and the incredible acting displayed by everyone involved. And yes, this includes Uma Thurman, despite my hatred for her - I regard her as a terrible actress, whatever beauty she may hold (and let's face it, there ain't much) and I refuse to watch most movies she stars in. She played a small role in this movie, and for once she actually played it well. I extend a hearty salutation.I must give a hearty thumbs up to John Travolta at this point. His character, Vincent Vega, is easily the best I have ever seen him play. Whilst he is a criminal, a junkie, a torturer and a murder, he manages to be extremely likable and you can't help sometimes but wish you were him.To those people who dislike intelligent movies - I advise you against watching this movie. The film grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go until the entire 114 minutes have expired, but if you're possessed of a lower IQ then by the end you won't have much of an idea of what's gone on.The film is constructed in Tarantino's trademark nonlinear fashion, meaning that if you want to watch this movie you haver to do so in one sitting to understand it. you can't just watch bits and pieces of it, otherwise it will make no sense to you whatsoever.I have regained a previously nonexistent respect for Mr. Tarantino with this film, and I look forward to perusing his works in more detail later on.""Get the Gimp!"""
21/03/2002,1,"This is my favorite film of all time. Every second of this film is engaging, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Tarantino's direction and script is brilliant, and every role is perfectly cast. Everything that happens in this movie has a purpose, and you don't realize it's hidden in plain sight until the final moments"
14/03/2002,1,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it."
13/03/2002,1,"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."
11/03/2002,1,I don't understand why this is the 8th highest rated movie of all time. I saw how highly rated it was so decided to watch it. After the first half an hour I found it enjoyable but my mind wasn't blown. As the movie continued I kept waiting for something to happen that warrants its 8.9 stars. Nothing actually happens in this movie. I hope its just me because through my eyes its the most overrated movie of all time.
21/02/2002,8,"With such an amazing cast and phenomenal creation staff it's no wonder I was blown away. I had flashbacks left and right while the dazzlingly twisting and interacting subplots kept me by turns confused and entertained. It's humorous without being slapstick, engagingly violent, and endlessly enthralling. Highly recommended!!"
25/01/2002,8,"As you can probably see from my title i like this film a lot! The casting is brilliant: Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken and even Steve Buscemi makes a cameo as Buddy Holly.The writing is extraordinary the imagination, time, planning, blood, sweat and tears that must have gone into writing it left me speechless. The occasional""comedy"" moment in this film always lightens the mood after a violent disturbing scene. Samuel L Jackson & John Travolta go together so well in this I'm surprised Tarantino hasn't thought of making a separate film with these two starring.This film is by far the greatest film I've seen so far in my life and i can't see Tarantino ever beating it, or in fact any other director beating it! So to cap it all off if you haven't seen this film yet you must you haven't lived until you have!"
24/01/2002,8,"A wonderful cast showing off some really entertaining characters. Storyline is fun but a bit cartoonish. Excellent movie for watching with friends and having a good time. I am not usually into casting celebrities but these guys with the direction of Tarantino find the quirkiness and coolness of the people they portray. It is really entertaining the way the director, Quentin Tarantino develops the storylines separately without tipping off the audience that as the movie progresses these storylines and these characters will come together and have impact on one another. Masterful work on Taratino's part, just when you think you know where it's going he opens another door and boom, surprise!"
11/01/2002,8,"I won't hide the fact that my comments here are directed toward the people that don't like this movie, but my foremost goal is to clarify a few issues about this movie that some people just plainly don't have right.Issue 1: The movie is gratuitously violent!Well, yes and no. I admit that for it's time 'Pulp Fiction' seemed excessively bloody and does at times glamorize violence, but if you review the film frame by frame, you'll realize that most of the violence is implied. The famous needle scene and Marvin's unexpected end actually show less than you may think. Tarantino stealthily cuts away at the exact moment when the audience expects to see something gruesome, and everything that we think we saw only occurred in our imaginations. Now apart from those two scenes, there is a sword fight and a few executions, but none of them are as gruesome as what one would expect to see in action movies.The reason why people believe the movie is so violent is because of the extraordinary tension that Tarantino builds up in every scene. Bret's interrogation creates incredible tension because everyone knows that it will explode in violence, but they don't know when. Vincent's ""accident"" is excruciating to some people because they see the gun bouncing in Vincent's hand just before it discharges. People find it painful to watch because what they fear would happen is exactly what happens. I know some people dislike this movie because everyone laughs at the violence. They don't seem to understand that the audience is supposed to laugh. The laughter is there to relieve the tension because otherwise the movie really would be gratuitously violent.This movie is a caricature of criminals and neurotics, and the point is to watch them react to their world. Fans of this movie are not blood-thirsty and do not find it cool to kill people. What so many like about 'Pulp Fiction' is how Tarantino builds up his events and then pays them off so elegantly that some mistake it for a director trying to be cool. He isn't trying. He's succeeding very brilliantly.Issue 2: The non-linear story is confusing and pointless!This issue that some people have with 'Pulp Fiction' really bewilders me, and it's plainly obvious that the people who says it are conventional movie watchers who don't like to put effort into what they're watching. These mainstream movie-goers want plot points and character arcs that can be diagrammed. While there's nothing wrong with linear story-telling, non-linear movies can be a relief sometimes, especially when it's done well. 'Pulp Fiction' is a perfect example of non-linear story-telling because the movie cannot be told in a linear fashion!Think about what would happen. The movie would begin with Jules and Vincent, but then Jules' redemption would happen midway through the movie, Vincent would go on his date with Mia, and finally Butch would have his turn. The movie wouldn't make any sense! People would wonder why Butch was introduced so late, and Jules' redemption would feel less meaningful because it would no longer be the focus at the end. But as it is, the movie begins and ends perfectly. Tarantino introduces all the characters at the correct moments, and he places the chapters in such a way that it brings more focus on the characters rather than the plot. If the movie had ended with Butch riding away, it would have felt drab and awkward, but ending with Jules feels ennobling.Issue 3: The dialogue is meaningless!I know it shouldn't, but this issue really ticks me off sometimes because there's not a shred of truth behind it. It's like complaining that Mozart's music has too many notes. People complain not because there's too many, but because they're just too lazy to listen to all of it and interpret what it means. As Roger Ebert says, Tarantino's dialogue is ""load bearing."" Take the ""Quarter Pounder with cheese"" discussion between Jules and Vincent. Some may believe it's frivolous dialogue, but the information we learn from it makes a reprise in a later interrogation and initiates the mounting tension in that scene.The discussion of foot massages introduces the imposing threat of dating Mia Wallace, and Fabi's speech about potbellies is used to hide the fear in her situation. She's trying to comfort herself with pillow talk so that she won't have to talk about hiding from the mafia. Honestly, 'Pulp Fiction' is the most quotable movie ever made. At times, the dialogue sounds like poetry. The conversations do not jump or bounce, they flow and ebb with the sounds always hitting their emotional cues. It's a rare film that can be just as entertaining when listened to rather than watched.If you are one of those few that cannot at least appreciate how well Tarantino creates his characters and narrative structure, then don't bother complaining because I already feel sorry that you cannot enjoy the movie as so many do. At the very least, you should not criticize the movie with false and shallow comments. Because really, in the end, you're only embarrassing yourself."
29/12/2001,8,Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that has gone down in history for the way it looks on screen and the messages sent throughout the course of the film. The film wouldn't be so eerily brilliant if it weren't for the lighting effects. Sometimes the faces of the character's are 1/2 lit or lit in a different way which really helps bring the concept of being in the shadows to the screen and it manages to make that more of a profound impact on the viewers because the person doesn't look normal or like they should. Another technique that was used very well in this film was the actual film making itself. The subjects were filmed in such a way that they complement the lighting effects but still make them visible for the audience to understand what is going on in the story.
28/12/2001,8,"This film could not be compared to others in its time. I strongly feel the Director took a risk and it paid off. Everything is unconventional. The characters is what makes this film so special. They each have there own needs, all conflicting with each others!! I love it!"
26/12/2001,8,"For the longest time, I'd see clips of Pulp Fiction, or people would reference it, and I'd have an image of what it was but I never watched it until recently. Let me just say I want to go back and slap my past self. This movie is a master piece. From the naturally flowing dialog that talks about anything and everything, to the actual acting of the leads John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis. It has it's over the top moments, its plan weird and bazar moments, and its violent tingly moments. And rapped all together you get pulp fiction. Literally fiction that is complete pulp. The music also has to be mention as having a huge impact on the style and overall coolness of the movie"
11/12/2001,7,"For Stuart Turner, the road to My Skeleton has been long and winding. Edinburgh native, Optimo regular, DJ, Red Bull Music Academy graduate, refugee from rock groups such as Degrassi, Russia and American Men, and for a short period a trainee corporate lawyer, much of Turner's debut album as Claude Speeed was sketched out on a guitar and laptop while he was travel-ling through India, Singapore and Cambodia.Subsequently, this material was refined and mixed at locations including Hudson Mohawke's studio in London and Kuedo's studio in Berlin, but it would be wrong to assume My Skeleton was in any way designed for club consumption. Instead, Turner's recent FACT mix – which eschewed beats in favors of twinkling drifts and droning computer music – offers a useful signpost to My Skeleton's contents. Present here is the fluorescent Cynthy glow and ADHD maximals that's common to his peers on the LuckyMe roster, but what's within is on a dreamy, ambient tip, melding classical minimalism, post-rock, cosmic Cynthy and systems music with an eye for personal exploration and spiritual reflection.Contemporary readings of such genres sometimes feel like the stuff of battle re-enactment, too studied to transcend their rich histories. On My Skeleton, though, Turner often takes pains to keep his music feeling living and breathing. 'Tiger Woods' and 'Spectral Choir' employ dancing Steve Reich patterns, but through these Turner laces weaving woodwind and ringing strings with half-heard field recordings from his travels, the bustle of a marketplace or the hum of traffic. There are songs, too: the melancholic twinkle of 'Hold On', featuring the folksy tones of female vocalist LW; or 'Taj Mahal', in which Turner takes the Mick in a manner that reminds me a little of Phil Elverum's work in lo-fie experimentalists The Microphones, his sleepy and sincere words half- buried under droning soft Xanthus and star bursts of heavily treated post- rock guitar. The title track breaks from the record's largely electronic recreations to employ a real string quartet, although thanks to pitch- shifting and diligent layering, there feels like no hard breaks between the real and the synthesized.There is trauma here, too, albeit sublimated into these woozy folds of sound. Turner's trip was prompted by bereavement, and here and there My Skeleton takes a turn into darkness. The Dom post-rock build of 'Prove You Exist' apparently went by the working title of 'Claude Speeed You Black Emperor', while 'Some Other Guy', which vacillates between diaphanous ambiance and harder Mego-like drones, is supposedly inspired by a visit to a tower of human skulls in Cambodia's Killing Fields. In the hands of some, this might come across slightly glib, a bit Selie- at-Auschwicz, but throughout My Skeleton, there's the sense that Turner is out to honestly communicate his own experience, even when emotions are embryonic, or sensations twisted by tiredness or fever. The result is a record that keeps the sense of a human being on a passage of exploration, its internal emotional landscape porous to the influence of the tumult and chaos of the world outside."
03/12/2001,8,"A good surprise I've been seeing this film, I had very little hope that this film came to like me, especially has a point engaging and keeps you entertained from beginning to the end without even making the slightest effort, even conversations are curious and entertaining, Tarantino is a director very category by works of cult like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill insuperable. The actors in this film are especially great among all make a perfect union that raise my score.The performances are quite correct, in my opinion highlighting the Uma Thurman, a pretty violent movie and too strong at times, is one of those films that scare even without cause tension and leaves you the willies at times. One of the things that also seemed luxury have been the musical interventions that appear, especially in which Uma Thurman dancing with John Travolta, that scene is epic, music can not be better because stick with the film, despite if not my genre I've been pleasantly surprised, just have errors, almost perfect, is not the kind of film that I usually fix although I have done and I am delighted for movie lovers this noventera wonder can not pass unnoticed."
11/11/2001,10,"Much people love Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and i don't blame them, the film has an unexpected way to show us a story of violence. ""Pulp Fiction"" just have my attention for one thing... the character of Uma Thurman, that i think (please, don't blame me if i'm wrong) Tarantino adapt from Neil Jordan's ""The Crying Game"". But, this is not the Femme Fatale that we know in Neil Jordan's film. Uma Thurman represents a sexy lady. A lady with her black hair. A lady who want dance without stop. ""Pulp Fiction"", i think, is an adaptation of all the violence of situations. Situations that is around us all the time... of course, with a little of fiction there. I confess the film cant be a favorite for me... but i admit is good made film. But a little excessive for nothing.After all the film works and has good thrills.*Sorry for the mistakes... well,if there any"
05/11/2001,10,"Pulp - soft, moist, shapeless mass or matter; a magazine or book containing tabloid content, printed on characteristic raw, cheap paper. Quentin Tarantino opens his film with the etymology and meaning of the first word from the world-famous title ""Pulp Fiction"". One word, and it contains the whole, how twisted, but also innovative form of the film, which is considered a breakthrough in the history of cinema, which can be confirmed by the words of moviegoers who divide the cinematography into the one before and after ""Pulp Fiction"". Three stories presented in a non-chronological way, but combined into a coherent whole, the cream of excellent actors, original dialogues that are memorable, as well as the rare humor of the main characters make the specific atmosphere of this film. Thanks to his innovative work, Quentin Tarantino emerged from the underground of the directorial world and became one of the most respected directors in the world."
17/10/2001,10,"There's no doubt about it: Tarantino's masterpiece is truly remarkable. Its script stands out as one of the most intelligent I've ever encountered. The non-linear story is intricately crafted, requiring multiple viewings to fully grasp its brilliance. While the movie doesn't revolve around a specific theme, there's a subtle undertone of redemption that adds depth. The characters and performances are practically flawless. Sam Jackson delivers one of his finest portrayals, and it's truly unjust that he didn't receive an Oscar for it. Each scene possesses its own distinct flavor and charm, with every segment seamlessly connecting to the main plot. The comedy and serious moments alike are superb, and the dialogue is consistently captivating, even when it appears inconsequential. This film guarantees a fantastic experience, making it a must-watch for all movie enthusiasts. I can't identify a single genuine flaw, solidifying its position as one of my all-time favorites that will endure for years to come."
09/10/2001,10,"Pulp Fiction is rightfully renowned as a landmark in modern film. Even when it was released in 1994 you just knew you were watching something that was changing the rules somehow.In essence the film was a series of delicious conversations between well crafted and memorable characters, punctuated by casual profanity, racist epithets and extremely adult topics, all set against an immaculately selected soundtrack of essential yet often obscure tracks selected from several decades. In between all this there were a few scenes of eye-opening violence and/or grown up situations.Rather than go into detail discussing what Pulp Fiction was about I have decided to talk more about what it made. And I am not referring to box office or DVD salesPulp Fiction:  made me wonder what the band aid was for.  made me and millions of others wonder what was in the case  made Jackrabbit Slim's, Big Kahuna Burger and Red Apple cigarettes household (fake) names.  made exploded penises the new severed ear.  made an Urge Overkill cover 'that OD song' and worse still  made The Rebels the unfortunate soundtrack to interracial male rape.Furthermore, it;  made Bruce Willis and John Travolta legit Hollywood Stars again.  (made me like John Travolta for 2 and a half hours!)  made Frank Whaley, Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette momentarily cool.  made Ving Rhames the coolest bad guy in years, Uma the coolest gangster's moll and Samuel L. Jackson the coolest MF *period* in 1994.  made Tim Roth, Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel lose zero cool points.  made dated hairstyles like Vince's ponytail, Mia's bob and Jules' 'Soul Glo' perm somehow acceptable.  made non-racists casually racists – at least when quoting dialogue from this film. ('Dead N***** storage', ""N***** please, that's all you had to say"", 'And he'll be damned if some g***'s gonna get his greasy yellow hands on his Father's watch').  made someone saying ""Bring out the gimp"" less confusing than it might have been in 1993.  made 2 ½ hours seem like not enough for once.  made me buy the movie poster, the VHS, the 10 year anniversary DVD, the 15 year anniversary DVD when the 10 year was stolen, and in all likelihood the blu-ray at some point in the future.And finally;  made a young buck named Tarantino the king of the world and master of the cinema universe. A title that he unfortunately swallowed too readily, leading to pap like Death Proof and over-rated dross like Inglourious Basterds. Dross that is inexplicably fawned over by a movie-going community somehow blinded by credits in the bank.Final Rating – 10 / 10. That last point aside, Pulp Fiction is indisputably a work of true greatness, rich, luxurious and rewarding of repeat viewing. It is what real filmmakers should aspire to.."
01/10/2001,10,"It's so long since I'd last seen this, and it's felt like I know more about opinions on and takes about this than I do about it for myself. It's almost as if I'd built up a kind of resistance to the cult around Tarantino and the mystique around his undoubted gifts. But getting back to the film itself, it's true that it just about (but only just) justifies the baggy running time (unlike subsequent films); it's funnier than I remember, and I enjoyed it more than I'd convinced myself I would. It's impressive, and it may ultimately be somewhat empty ... but there's no doubting either its significance, that when it's good it really flies, and that Tarantino's trademark lack of wisdom and restraint is on show too."
24/07/2001,9,"If your looking for a movie filled with thrills, drama, suspense, and whickedly funny humour then this is the one for you. Tarantino directs the best movie ever. It has different chapters with different characters. The movie is about two hitmen(Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta) that recover a briefcase for their boss Marcellus Wallace(Ving Rhames), a last chance prizefighter who sees a way out, and others. Over two days these characters and more meet their fates. If you do decide to watch this movie and like it I recommend, Reservoir Dogs and True Romance. If you don't like this review that I've posted and it doesn't sound good to you, then read the other reviews first. I'm sure that most prefer this movie."
09/07/2001,9,"Pulp Fiction was my first Tarantino I ever saw and was instantly hooked to them. The ""reverse"" storytelling, use of language and the extreme (altought sometimes meaby overusage) of violence made me a huge Tarantino fan.Pulp Fiction has everything that a crime/drama movie needs. Interesting characters, different settings and very VERY hooking story.I highly recommend you to watch this movie!"
23/06/2001,9,"This movie is truly one of the best I have ever seen. Not just the best Tarantino has ever made, but the BEST! It's simply a classic. I love that it.. kind of ""jumps"" back and forward in time. And when she draws a square in the air, it appears a square, that then vanishes. I know what your thinking, ""Details"", but if you come to think about it, details is the most important. I really love this movie... And the cast! I mean John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, so on, so on... It's just ... amazing! To all that hasn't seen it, see it! To all that has seen it, see it again! To all that has seen it so many times that you don't wanna see it again, there is no such person. Because this movie is so damn good, you wanna see it over and over and over again! It's a damn fine piece of art, that's just what it is!"
19/02/2001,8,"Pulp Fiction (1994), Quentin Tarantino produces what he is know for today, a dark, witty, and captivating film that has a disjointed flow of time but no pacing issues because of it. The film is excellently shot with great use of lighting and scenery. Where this film really shines though is the captivating dialogue and riveting characters. You're attention as a viewer is completely locked into what these characters are going to say next. While not my favorite Tarantino flick it is arguably the most recognizable in the mainstream and for good reason, it's a must watch."
12/02/2001,8,"Quentin Tarantino is a name with which many are familiar, especially if you call yourself a movie buff. However, Tarantino seems to be one of those directors, whose material you either love or hate. For the most part, I think I'd put myself in the ""hate"" category. Neither volume of Kill Bill really appealed to me, and I haven't bothered to see any of Tarantino's other films. Any other than Pulp Fiction, that is, a film which I definitely did not hate.Pulp Fiction's three greatest strengths are the characters, the stories, and the direction. Each character possesses a life of its own and each actor propels that character onto the screen in such a dazzling and eccentric way that you can't help but enjoy the action on screen. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis, actors you would expect to see in a brainless action flick, all put in good performances. Sure, there's no powerful drama, but the interesting stories are the focus here. Each character fits his or her story, and the entertainment increases as the stories intertwine energetically thanks to Tarantino's direction. Also, unlike Kill Bill, the focus of Pulp Fiction is not mindless action, but the brilliant stories and characters themselves.Now, on to Tarantino's famous Pulp Fiction screenplay. Let me begin by saying that, for the most part, the dialogue is as interesting as the characters and the stories, providing insight into their lives. However, as with any movie that attempts to infuse comedy, it's hit-and-miss. There are several more hits than misses, but some of the dialogue in the film is so absurd, that it can't help but detract from the rest of the film.Therefore, if you're looking for a deep, profound film, then I can't really recommend to you Pulp Fiction, as, in my opinion, it's just a popcorn flick. Yet this is a smart, even brilliant, popcorn flick, and I dare you not to be entertained.Final Grade: A."
10/02/2001,8,"Much like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction works so well because of its structure. In Tarantino's freshman effort, he used the out of time elements to break up the one set monotony and provide lighter tonal moments here and there. In Pulp Fiction, it's used at the behest of thematic material, and I think it works on a whole different level.It's sort of an anthology film, but the three sections a little too interconnected to just lay it like that. They're connected through a similar set of characters that appear in, or are talked about, in all three, but also with the common theme of choice in the face of fate.In every story, from the dual framing devices (the café and the shootout over the suitcase) to the three main stories, characters are presented with inflection points in their lives, and they chose to go one way or another. Vincent Vega has come back to Los Angeles from several years as ""the man in Amsterdam"". One of his first tasks is to take his mob boss's wife, Mia Wallace, out for dinner, to provide her with company while her husband, Marsellus Wallace, is out of town. There's an connection between them that caps with them both dancing in a twist contest in the wonderfully grotesque nostalgia restaurant Jack Rabbit Slim's. Vincent refuses to take the next step, though. We're not quite sure if Mia would go to bed with Vincent (the way she talks about her husband demonstrates her fidelity towards him), but her willingness isn't the point. The point is Vincent's desire to make a move. He feels it's within the realm of possibility, but he refuses to take that step.Of course, he never really gets the chance because Mia has found Vincent's stash of heroin and snorted it, which was simply too much for her system and she began to overdose. This leads to the most famous scene in the movie where Vincent has to puncture Mia's breastplate with a six inch needle in Vincent's drug dealer's house. It's a great moment of tension with a fantastic shock.Taking a step back from that description of the first major third of the film, I think we can see in microcosm why Pulp Fiction works so well. We have fantastically written characters. We have an exploration of the central theme playing out dramatically. We have some spectacle in the form of the needle episode. It's a marvelous combination of entertainment, character work, and strong thematic material wrapped together extraordinarily well.The second third deals with Butch, a boxer we saw talking with Marsellus Wallace in the first. This also takes place after the third section. Butch has agreed to throw his fight, but he used the quasi-public knowledge of the agreement to cleanup on the odds and win big by winning the fight. He's prepped and ready to go, talking lightly with his girlfriend Fabienne as they spend the night in a hotel talking about the nature of attractiveness (really, her desire for a pot belly), and make fun of each other. He's set for life, and he knows it, but something's wrong. His father's watch is missing, left behind at the apartment. Christopher Walken actually started the story with a telling of the history of that watch (the famous ass watch scene), which he delivers wonderfully. It also sells the importance of the watch to Butch so that when he suddenly loses his cool and decides to brave what should surely be certain death to get it back, we get it. It makes sense. He has to go get it. There's no other choice. He goes back, gets it, gives Vincent a chest full of led from Vincent's own gun, and then accidentally happens across Marsellus Wallace as he drives away.There's fate again, presenting Butch with a situation where he has a choice. After a car crash and a limp-filled foot chase, the two end up trapped in the basement of two perverts (one a cop) who proceed to rape Wallace. Butch uses his opportunity to escape and has another choice. He could leave, scot free, or he could free Wallace. He does the right thing, grabs a samurai sword, and cuts down the perverts (and their gimp with a solid punch to the face). Wallace returns this favor by letting Butch go. They will break ties and have no more to do with each other.The third is where the thematic material comes out most and comes to the best conclusion. Even though it happens before the rest of the movie, the path that Jules follows and how he ends the film is the culmination of the ideas flowing through it. We pick back up with Vincent and Jules in the apartment with the briefcase. An unknown gunman jumps out and fires, emptying his gun in their direction but hitting nothing. After the darkly comic episode where they have to clean up brains from the back of their car, Vincent and Jules settle down in the café that started the film as Jules talks about their miraculous escape and how he plans on facing that with the rest of his life. Vincent considers it a freak accident, but Jules sees it as a sign from a higher power. He's been given an opportunity and a choice, and he's going to take a new path in response to it. He demonstrates that new path by allowing the robbers from the beginning of the film to leave with their lives.Thinking back over the rest of the movie, we realize the order of events as they played out chronologically and discover that Vincent died after the ending of the movie, at Butch's hands. If Jules had kept on his path without diverting it, ascribing the freak gun event as mere happenstance instead of a sign, Jules might have died there too. The universe reached out to both Vincent and Jules, and it was only Jules who read the sign correctly to run off to be like Caine from Kung Fu.So, sitting back, what is Pulp Fiction? First, it's a story that's told out of order chronologically but is arranged in a way that heightens its emotional and thematic impact. It's very well acted, filled with wonderful conversations between well-drawn and interesting characters. It's dotted with great moments of excitement, the kind you expect from a good time at the movies. It's an entire package of entertainment, thematic weight, and great characters.No wonder it made such a splash."
07/02/2001,8,Good job by actors. I want to tell about name of my favourite rock band. Band 25/17 - the most popular in the Russia. The name was born from Pulp Fiction: Ezekiel 25:17
08/01/2001,9,"This was a pretty good black comedy.  So much has been written about this movie and so many people like it that it is hardly worth adding my two cents.  I found the sick humor to be a little over-the-top for me and although this is a cleaver movie with some fine performances, I find a good deal of it to be both obnoxious and gimmicky.  Perhaps, only the Matrix is as over-rated as this film.  Interesting movie which I would recommend to anyone who likes off-beat movies.  I vastly prefer Resevoir Dogs and Desperado.  I might add that this was an incredibly influential film and it still influences how films are being made today.  The list of ""film noir"" movies that were influenced by Pulp Fiction are almost too numerous to mention.  One of these was THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU ARE DEAD which I liked better than its' predecessor.  Being very original, PULP FICTION was seen as a ""breath of fresh air"".  It became a Hollywood fad to ""love"" this movie.  It isn't that great.  I give it a 7.  I've seen better, and I've seen much better."
04/01/2001,9,"This movie meant a lot of changes for the entire industry, the unusual way for telling us a story, main characters with unique personalities who exudes tons of charisma, the music and photography take us back to the 90 years ... and we can't ignore every single detail that Tarantino placed in the whole movie is probably more essential than we thought. It's not a coincidence that many directors use Pulp Fiction like a guide for making their movies....It could be taken as a cliche comment, but Pulp Fiction is an obligatory date for every person, it doesn't matter what kind of movies are your favourites, trust me, this movie could hardly dissapoint you."
29/12/2000,8,"My favorite Quentin Tarantino movie. I love the setting of this movie, the convo is brilliantly funny, the characters are cool. It's still one of the best movies till today"
30/11/2000,10,"""Pulp Fiction"" is an iconic film that defies traditional narrative structure and captivates audiences with its raw, unpredictable storytelling. Directed by Quentin Tarantino, this crime-drama masterpiece weaves together multiple interconnected stories, creating a tapestry of dark humor, intense violence, and unforgettable characters.Tarantino's distinct directorial style shines through in ""Pulp Fiction,"" showcasing his love for pop culture references, nonlinear storytelling, and a cleverly crafted screenplay. The film takes us on a rollercoaster ride through the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles, introducing us to hitmen, mob bosses, boxers, and a range of eccentric individuals whose lives intersect in unexpected ways.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its exceptional ensemble cast. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis deliver outstanding performances, breathing life into their flawed and morally ambiguous characters. Their chemistry is palpable, and their dialogue crackles with Tarantino's signature wit and sharpness.""Pulp Fiction"" is a masterclass in non-linear storytelling, with its fragmented narrative expertly crafted to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The film skillfully jumps back and forth in time, seamlessly connecting seemingly disparate events and revealing the intricate web of consequences and coincidences that shape the characters' lives. It's a testament to Tarantino's genius as a storyteller.Moreover, the film's soundtrack is a treasure trove of eclectic and memorable tunes that complement each scene perfectly. From the opening bars of ""Misirlou"" to the soulful sounds of ""Son of a Preacher Man,"" the music heightens the film's atmosphere and becomes an integral part of its DNA.While ""Pulp Fiction"" is undeniably violent and occasionally shocking, it serves a purpose within the context of the story. Tarantino uses violence as a tool to examine themes of redemption, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions. It's an unflinching exploration of human nature, morality, and the blurred lines between good and evil.In conclusion, ""Pulp Fiction"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences even decades after its release. Tarantino's audacious storytelling, coupled with exceptional performances and a memorable soundtrack, cements its status as a timeless classic. It's a film that challenges conventions, pushes boundaries, and leaves an indelible mark on the landscape of cinema."
15/11/2000,10,"This movie has to be absolutely one of the best 5 of all time.  The directing, the dialogue, the acting, everything about this movie is flawlessly executed and thought-out.  The fact that you can't even classify this into a genre, (it is an action/comedy/drama/many other things), just speaks volumes about Tarantino's directing.  Samuel L. Jackson's monologues at the beginning (and at the end, for that matter) of the movie are so brilliantly scripted and acted out that it makes you wonder why he never received an Oscar for his performance. Ving Rhames, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth and Tarantino himself submit excellent roles.I give it 11 out of 10"
07/11/2000,10,Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. Its a must see. I saw it as a little kid and it inspired me to become a film maker. I've been playing with cameras and scripts since i was just 7 years old. A movie that changed my life is one that deserves a 100 stars out of ten. In the film we get a sense of pure comedic and yet serious attitudes. I enjoyed the comedic aspects especially. The gore is also another aspect i love. There's some sort of style that Tarantino adds to the gore which makes it fun to watch. I will never forget this film. Quentin Tarantino is truly a genius.
06/11/2000,10,"There is nothing inherently spectacular about this movie but my pulse is consistent, I love Pulp Fiction. For a movie about just people going about their day, the probability of these events but also their absurdity creates a story that is extremely captivating.This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece but at the end of the day, I don't want more of these. It is good for what it is but I am happy to say I watch it once every couple of years and that I enjoy it enough each time."
25/09/2000,10,"Pulp Fiction is a classic film that has stood the test of time. Directed by Quentin Tarantino, the movie is a non-linear exploration of the Los Angeles criminal underworld, told through several interconnecting stories.One of the most striking things about Pulp Fiction is its unique structure, which jumps back and forth in time and interweaves multiple narratives. This allows the film to build tension, create surprises, and keep the audience engaged from start to finish.The film is also filled with memorable characters, including hitmen Vincent and Jules, played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, respectively. These characters are well-defined and perfectly cast, bringing a sense of cool and swagger to the film. The dialogue is sharp and often hilarious, making for some truly iconic moments.Pulp Fiction also features standout performances from other actors, including Uma Thurman as Mia, the heroin-addicted wife of a gangster, and Christopher Walken as a war veteran with a captivating story.One of the most impressive aspects of Pulp Fiction is its ability to balance humor, violence, and drama. The film is at times brutal and disturbing, but it's also often laugh-out-loud funny. This is a testament to Tarantino's talent as a filmmaker and his ability to create a unique and unforgettable movie experience.Overall, Pulp Fiction is a must-see film for fans of crime dramas, independent films, and great storytelling. It's a classic in every sense of the word and a true masterpiece of modern cinema."
28/07/2000,9,"I love this movie. However, Quentin Tarantino should stay on the other side of the camera. I love his work but yikes! He comes off whiny and obnoxious, and the nasal quality of his voice is not too pleasant. Otherwise, though, it's a creative and joyous mess. I adore it."
19/07/2000,9,"The Greatest Of Tarantino.With such a genius narrative way and the right story with such a great acting from all the cast.And if we come back to the narrative that is such great with its own genius and way that keeps you tuned through the whole movie.With Such Great narrative comes great events which is all at first from a great story but the way he presented it with was just the best.Tarantino here has it all from action and comedy and madness which all are so much exciting which makes you excited the whole movie and want to know what is gonna happen.So I had great fun with this movie, and I hope you do too."
17/07/2000,9,"Okay, maybe that summary is overstating it a bit. Still, I love this film more than any other piece of art (be it motion picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, written word or performance) in the world. Pulp Fiction has kidnapped my senses completely for two and a half at a time, nearly a hundred times.There's no reason to explain for there have been far too many explanations already. But there's Vincent Vega aimlessly stepping through nostalgia personified in the 50's themed diner, Jack Rabbit Slim's. Then you've got a tight shot of Jules Winnfield's expression of wrath as he turns around to say ""-And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and FURRRRIOUSSS anger..."". Mia Wallace's dirty bare foot. A drop of liquid from a thin needle, three feet above Mia's chest. ""Bacon tastes goood. Porkchops taste gooood."" ""What does it feel like to kill a man with your bare hands? It is a topic I'm very interested in."" ""Blueberry pie to match the pancakes.""
I romanticize it too damn much, I know it. But it all just clicks for me. It all makes so much sense. Everytime I watch it I feel supreme satisfaction, knowing I just got a perfect helping of the marriage of image and storytelling.I don't know if I should even try to justify, defend or promote the film because I feel that it is beyond all of that. I just hope that my quick, little blurb here successfully displays the deep emotional connection I have to Pulp Fiction. That alone has GOT to say something to someone who has their doubts about it. If it knocked me out, as it did, give it a chance and it might give you a good punch too."
16/07/2000,9,"I watched this movie a few yrs ago and really didn't like it at all. I decided last evening to give it another try seeing all the great reviews that it was getting. Well to my surprise I must say I did enjoy it this time. It was rather long but overall it wasn't boring , also I found it quite humorous at times!!"
29/06/2000,9,"I am going to open this review by stating that I understand there is no reason for me to even bring my thoughts to life, there are A LOT of reviews on this movie. I know my opinion means nothing, but nothing is what I have to do right now. So, here is one man's meaningless, and overlong option on a movie that is almost 30 years old. Hope you like it.When I first experienced this movie it was April of 2022, I was 16 (almost 17) and I viewed it on an app called: ""Zaviramon"", I do NOT recommend this sorta sketchy, terrible app. I could barley enjoy the movie and had originally placed my IMDB score at an 8. I did not hate the movie but could not possibly see what was considered so great about it. Also, every five minutes I had to close the app and restart it to continue the movie, so that probably didn't help. But all in all, it was a movie and I found it alright. I didn't really care about the characters or the story I just watched it to watch it and that was it. My opinion quickly changed upon my next viewing.I am at a Target store, newly 17, when I see ""Pulp Fiction"" in the $5 movie area, I pick it up. Maybe I will give it another viewing. Maybe it was the conditions under how I watched that was the reason for me being underwhelmed. For a few weeks all the movie did was sit on my shelf and look pretty, until one day in June. My younger brother was away, so I popped it into the X-box, and gave it a try. Man, was that movie good. It was such an Ultra-cool treat of a film. I couldn't stop enjoying myself. Every performance was perfect (yes, even Quentin's) the writing is so crisp, and funny, and exciting. Tarintino's direction is top shelf. Sure, I had noticed these thing on my first watch but not to the level of my second. I quickly changed my IMDB score to a 9 (sorry still did not strike me as perfect). Then I made the decision to view it again.This was another day where my brother was of adventuring on his own. I watched it and loved it. See this movie!"
16/06/2000,9,"The most important film of all time.The aesthetically pleasing shots and beautiful cinematography, and the right amount of violence.If you want to make a film you need to watch this, if you want to go to a film school you need to watch this. If you want to be just a film watcher you need to watch this film. If you do not even want to watch a film but you want to tell someone to watch a film, you should tell them to watch this film.I believe Pulp Fiction did divide the cinema era into two, the era before Pulp Fiction and the era after Pulp Fiction. The narrative is great, the edit has its own style and the idea behind the story is amazing."
05/06/2000,9,"This film is brilliant. It got 3 stories, violence, swearing and crime. Those 3 words and Quentin Tarantino are lethal commonation. This film is also John Travolta`s comeback and first real role for Samuel L Jackson. Ving Rhames makes excellent role too and Bruce Willis... oh my god how much stars. Harvey Keitel is amazing at wolf who cleans the mess. This film is so brilliant and even i can`t say it all."
31/05/2000,1,"I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.While I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing."
17/05/2000,1,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."
29/04/2000,5,"Simply put Pulp Fiction is the silliest film I have every seen, it puts 
 Battlefield Earth and The Long Kiss Goodnight (spookily starring the 
 two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare 
 vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. The fact it is so highly 
 revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the 
 very existence of modern society.
 
 There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion, 
 the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's 
 director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start 
 to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an 
 untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The 
 only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a 
 collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely 
 together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude, 
 made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse, 
 accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as 
 cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a 
 highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art' 
 piece is doubly irresponsible.
 
 Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth. 
 There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to 
 perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they 
 perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to 
 what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly 
 likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from 
 perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer 
 and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the 
 film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where 
 an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the 
 'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring 
 Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia 
 herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film 
 throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be 
 developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch) 
 or their actions performed by a completely new character without making 
 a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the 
 subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who 
 is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is 
 the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage' 
 (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill 
 where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit 
 to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of 
 plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could 
 disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was 
 written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job 
 narrative structure enhanced the story.
 
 The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at 
 times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to 
 mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames) 
 uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The 
 only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the 
 ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a 
 flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue 
 which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is 
 unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots 
 talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers, 
 milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some 
 coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but 
 mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with 
 such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking 
 about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring 
 brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no 
 substance and you have one worthless film. ""Ah you don't get it"" they 
 all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the 
 ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance. 
 The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to 
 justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant 
 to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which 
 consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no 
 actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with 
 any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care 
 even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless 
 monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the 
 briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it 
 beautiful"". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character 
 that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it, 
 combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it. 
 Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion 
 because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some 
 have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings 
 that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has 
 somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As 
 a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself 
 but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the 
 exception."
27/04/2000,5,"Quentin Tarantino co-wrote, directed and co-stars in this flamboyant, literate, byzantine drama which is structured like a dime-store novel. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are Los Angeles hit-men, Uma Thurman is a gangster's girl whom Travolta is asked to entertain, Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run after one of his fights ended in death. Critically-acclaimed picture caught fire with audiences as well, resulting in more show-biz success stories than any other film of the 1990's. Is it really that good? Yes, the verbal interplay and canny, cheeky handling is quite often exhilarating, and the performances by Travolta, Jackson and Willis (and Harvey Keitel as a low-keyed Mob kingpin) are near-perfection; however, the film's mixture of queasy, bloody violence (undermined by the jokey tone) and the barrage of foul-mouthed, low-life characters can easily become wearing. It won't be to everyone's taste, surely, but it's a visceral, gripping cinematic experience nevertheless, one with a knockout soundtrack and an Oscar-winning screenplay. *** from ****"
18/03/2000,1,Before I saw this I assumed it was probably overrated. I was wrong. It lives up to and surpasses its reputation in pretty much every way. I would definitely recommend.
24/02/2000,8,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database."
31/01/2000,8,"The first time i saw this movie, i only saw parts of it. But that was still enough to blow me away because i got the good parts. Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson, John Travolta, David Spade......... everybody is good in this movie. There are more good actors i cant think of right now. All the character's strories connected in such a great way. And after watching it i had a feeling of WOW THAT WAS A GREAT MOVIE , because the movie was so strange, if you know what I mean. This movie might leave you a feeling of awesomeness because you will be glad you saw it. I bet you will be thinking about this movie for the rest of the day or even your week, and wondering how it was so good - if you liked it-."
20/01/2000,8,The only other movie that I can safely rate a 10/10 is maybe Shawshank redemption . Pulpfiction does not have one scene in the entire film that isn't entertaining. You can watch it unlimited times and it never gets old . The movie never ages and always stays relevant . I am not exaggerating I have probably seen the movie 50+ times it's kind of an every couple months movie . The acting the soundtrack the dialogue the scenery is a masterpiece . The thing I like the most is the real human to human conversations that just flow instead in natural conversations instead of scripted garbage that's recycled in today's films . 10/10 the best movie ever made .
08/01/2000,9,"I will give you the laziest review of the film with 100% accurate facts issued as opinions:~Entertaining out of sequence storytelling was for some reason a huge deal to critics in 1994~ every performance in this film is show stoppingly excellent. Even flock of seagulls~ The soundtrack is a celebrity~ this film is about the love of people how people are funny and love each other, and the bad things that they do to each other~Dialogue.~ every day life can be exciting~ the movie loves other movies and in turn is loved by other movies~ if you've never seen it don't see it unless you wanna see it."
06/01/2000,9,"The modern-day movie public seems entranced with the in-your-face barbaric and crude film style of Quentin Tarantino. The writer-producer-actor definitely has talent, and an imagination. But films such as this that have long-running dialogs - some sensible but mostly far-fetched, need to have a solid plot to be interesting. The plot of ""Pulp Fiction"" is very weak - almost pointless. And when the long stretches of cinematic street philosophy are punctuated with brutal scenes of blood and guts, I don't find much of anything entertaining.I enjoy great mysteries, including some of the better film noir. But for the gore and guts movies to be good and have appeal, they must at least have an interesting plot and very good screenplay. ""Reservoir Dogs"" was such a Tarantino movie. But this plot has scenarios that bounce around in a weak screenplay. While there's a thin thread that connects some parts, others don't mesh. So, it comes across as a few short stories put together, some of which have the same characters.An example of this is when Christopher Walken's Captain Koons tells a tall story to a young boy named Butch Coolidge. Two scenarios or so later, Butch is a full-grown boxer played by Bruce Willis. Other scenarios happen out of order, or in reverse order. This seems to be a style with Tarantino, and one that some movie critics and buffs think is a great talent. I think it's a technique meant to grab an audience where the writer can't figure out a way to do it with a straight story chronologically.This sort of sets on end the long-standing teaching and methods of storytelling, writing, and playwrighting. And, there are a number of people who still prefer the chronological order of stories. We don't mind the use of flashbacks which are clearly identified as such. But wide changes in time or order, back and forth, from one scenario to another is confusing and says the author couldn't come up with the right ending. So, he or she used some weird techniques to make an ending superfluous. And, some of these films really don't have endings.This film could have started or ended just about anyplace within the screenplay. Tarantino or the director just needed to shuffle the pages. It ruins what might be a good story for me. As for the acting in this film - what's so outstanding about characters spewing vulgarities back and forth, or screaming and intimidating people with foul threats in running expletives? Seems we all have a tantrum streak within us.""Pulp Fiction"" isn't an enjoyable or entertaining film. It is a look at the underworld of drugs, thugs, blood and guts. The only thing I can see that might attract such near adulation for this film is the huge and diverse cast. But I'll take any number of other types of films that can entertain with solid plots, screenplays with civility, and great acting."
28/12/1999,8,Incredibly good. Not quite as good as Reservoir Dogs but but pretty close and anything that one would come in a mile of Reservoir Dogs must be incredible. In my opinion the greatest writer/director of all time Quentin Tarantino- who is my idle writes and directs this and incase you don't know wrote and directed Reservoir Dogs aswell. This really was and still is ground-breaking so clever and funny with great performences. In my opinion this and Dogs are far superior to the likes of The Godfather- not that that is a bad film thats fantastic but not nearly as good as this and Dogs (in my opinion) QTs next film after this was the excellent Jackie Brown and I can't wait for Kill Bill
02/12/1999,7,"The first movie to introduce me to the world of writing good dialogue and using the camera as a character. Learned so much about pacing, music and humor from this one!"
24/11/1999,10,"Sam Jackson's lines in the final scene, and his outstanding delivery, are the best lines ever written for film.The film itself is fantastic-but that last scene is the icing on the cake and truly takes this film to the top of the list of the best movies ever made.Pulp Fiction seems to be shown on cable and regular TV often these days-and I watch it like a religious experience waiting for the pay off at the end.If the final ending moves you like it did me please comment. The real funny thing about this show is when I saw it in the theater in 1994 I was initially very turned off by the violence-hated it the first time out. But after watching it a second and third (and now hundreds x's) time it grew on me, and I realized the violence blocked the meaning of the movie for me at first."
23/11/1999,10,"I have abandoned this movie so many times. I'm so glad that I made myself sit through the first ten minutes. At first I was confused where it was going. Then I realized it wasn't. Things just sorta happened.Jules' performance was probably the highlight. The ability to stoke fear and laughs was amazing acting.Truly timeless in nature. I also loved that the movie didn't rely too much on chronological order to tell the stories. It didn't feel forced and allowed us to focus more on the characters.Its crazy to me that this is Quentin Tarantino's early films. Screenplay, dialogues, and cinematography is solid. Will definitely be a rewatch happening soon."
13/11/1999,10,"My measure for a film being good is what feelings and atmosphere it makes deep in my unconscious so that if I remember the film after years that feelings reload. We of course wont remember the storylines and dialogues after years. Being said, pulp fiction is a film of dialogues for the most part and all will be forgotten after weeks of seeing the movie. What stays with you is the exotic ambiance and non-ordinary characters. The camera and cinematography is good letting actors to shine. Samuel Jackson acting is a masterpiece. He plays with his mimic and eyes. The bruce willis chapter is just too much. His girlfriend does not make any remarks at all. Bruce, himself is a lost character. Not well characterized. Even with that watch story. Is not believable. On the other hand Travolta, Jackson and Thurman are characterized perfectly because they are in the main theme and there is a nice suspense around their parts in screenplay. The rhythm of the movie and editing and cutting the shots is medium-fast but it drops at some parts like the Bruce and his girlfriend at hotel or the Tarantino role made coffees in kitchen, or Bruce at the taxi. The loop shaped narrative is the nicest suspension in the form. Good movie. Unique style. Needs balls to take adventure like this. Tarantino has it."
10/11/1999,9,"Seven sequences, a few more scenes, an inventive and juicy unchronological order, and a fresh and spicy dialogue that took on a new level of realism in the midst of this otherwise exaggerated reality - that was all it took for Quentin Tarantino to elevate his status from one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers (after his debut Reservoir Dogs) to one of the greatest new American directors since Orson Welles. 25 years on, Pulp Fiction stands the test of time without breaking a sweat, and it probably always will. One of the reasons is that it is not set in any specific period or location; it creates its own universe based upon an (un)idealized version of L. A. Another reason is that it deals with timeless movie issues, if not necessarily life issues, with which Tarantino toys with utmost skill and playfulness. There is a crudeness to it all, too, but it's a naïve, curious crudeness, not an exploitative one. And Tarantino is not out to trick anyone; he's in love with his material. Or more correctly, he's in love with what inspired his material. He's a movie aficionado at work, and in full bloom, who manages not only to pay tribute to the medium he so clearly worships, but also to advance the medium and create and tell stories that are unique, irresistible and transcending. With an ensemble cast that included many performers who were given a career boost by this movie, not least a vigorous John Travolta who went back from the B-list to the A-list."
29/10/1999,10,"In ""Pulp Fiction,"" Quentin Tarantino doesn't just tell a story - he crafts an entire universe. His daring approach to storytelling flips the script on traditional narrative rules, pulling us into a maze of crime, redemption, and moral gray areas.Tarantino's knack for mixing music and visuals gives the film a hypnotic quality, making every scene feel like a wild ride for the senses. And let's talk about his dialogue - it's like each character has their own soulful rhythm, adding layers of depth and intrigue.With its perfect blend of laughs and thrills, ""Pulp Fiction"" isn't just a movie - it's a cultural phenomenon that keeps us coming back for more, year after year."
25/09/1999,10,This is the best 1990s movie i have ever seen. That movie has everything the acting was top-notch. And the scenes was fun and amazing and the plot was really good. And the camera angles was good at best. And the music was good. And thanks to quentin Tarantino and john travolta and uma thurman and samuel l. Jackson and bruce willis. For have acted in this movie. 10/10.
16/09/1999,10,"Pulp Fiction is the film with no meaning, and it's easily perfect. Pulp Fiction displays true growth of story, Oscar worthy acting from Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and John Travolta. The story is moderately difficult to follow as the story unfolds with no certain timeline until the end. Overall, it's the finest piece of Tarantino's work and for the artistic viewer it is a perfect movie for the right mind."
04/09/1999,10,"This movie was recommended to me by so many people, it has also high ratings, so I gave it a go. Three times. Three times have I watched this film, and I have to say, it is overrated. It is not funny, has no story at all, and I was bored watching it.It is not that I don't get what's happening, the thing is, nothing happens at all.The reason why it still gets 3/10 is because of its aesthetics, atmosphere, and the work of the actors/actresses. But otherwise, it was a waste of my time.I am sorry to say this, but it feels like people like this movie so much just for the sake of belonging to the so-called intellectuals. And everyone else, who does not like it, just does not get it. The thing I truly can not understand, is the high ratings."
19/08/1999,6,"Tarantino does it again! From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! The plot and dialog is so edgy and griping that I never wanted the movie to end. The only down side was all the story's in the movies where out of order which I know added to the suspense to the movie, but it also made it a little hard to follow and keep straight. Bruce Willies gives a great performance along side Samuel L Jackson, and John Travolta. A star studded cast that delivers as good as this one is bound to stand the test of time. I for one cannot wait to see what Tarantino comes out with next!"
13/08/1999,6,"It's crazy to think how I've never seen Pulp Fiction until a few days ago. It's crazy how it's one of the last Tarantino movies I've seen and the fact that it still holds up is mindblowing.Pulp Fiction is a collection of four stories that interwine which include a boxer, two hitmen, a gangster and his wife and two bandits.The amazing part of Pulp Fiction is how brilliant each scene and each character is. Each scene has iconic written all over it. I thought the film was going to be overly violent but that's not the case. It's just characters talking but it's the dialogues that make it so engaging. Seeing John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson talk about cheeseburgers and foot massages for a couple of minutes make them feel like ordinary people rather than just hitmen. There is a feeling of realism between each character interaction. It's something moves steadily without losing momentum at any given point. Then you have characters that only appear for a short amount of time like Mr. Wolf and they have such a huge and memorable impact on the film. If this isn't Quentin Tarantino's best screenplay, I don't know what is.Another aspect that caught my attention was the excellent soundtrack. It's no surprise for a Tarantino film to have great song choices and placements but there's something about the songs in Pulp Fiction that work so well with each scene they're embedded into. It's absolutely perfect. The film's narrative is very interesting as it goes back and forth with each chapter. Each chapter, by the way, is fantastic. All of them are filled with terrific moments and iconic scenes that makes it difficult to lose interest. If that wasn't enough, the performances will surely win you over. It's great to see John Travolta and Bruce Willis give stellar performances especially after seeing them in the films they're currently doing. Samuel L. Jackson has never been better and the rest of the extraordinary ensemble cast are at the top of their game.I love seeing filmmakers express their love for cinema within each of their films and Tarantino has been consistently doing that, creating memorable movies his entire career. Pulp Fiction will remain his masterpiece for years to come. Now that I think of it, it's no surprise how well Pulp Fiction holds up to this day. After all, it is a timeless classic."
08/08/1999,7,"Of all the Tarantino movies, this is the one that gets quoted most often. It's also the one that has the most commonly seen film cover (at least in my experience). This film is a lot of fun, masterfully written and executed to absolute perfection by Quentin Tarantino. This, in my humble opinion, is a much better effort than his previous Reservoir Dogs.
This film is a perfect example of a good non-linear narration done right. It's not too difficult to mess up a movie whose storyline isn't told in chronological order, but Tarantino knows how to pull it off, how to make it entertaining and endlessly appealing from start to finish. There was never a dull moment in this movie.
To sum up Pulp Fiction, it would be fair to say that it is 154 minutes of pure cinematic magic."
21/07/1999,9,"Quentin Tarrantino is in general better known for the amount of violence in his films than any merits they have, and after seeing ""Pulp Fiction,"" I can see why. The film had an extreme amount of violence, yes, but it had few merits. The stories were none too original or exciting and the final attempt to connect them was completely unsuccessful and really brought to the fore what a disconnected, nonsensical mess the entire film is.The characters are flat and dull, the dialogue is made up of about six total words, five of which cannot be used on network television, the stories aren't exciting, and those stories have an attempted connection that doesn't really connect them. Tarrantino seems to have been playing around with time and non-linear narrative, but the film barely, if at all, made any sense. There seems to be no reason for anything that happens and the unusual narrative, rather than drawing the viewer in, is beyond Tarrantino's (the writer) abilities. Further, Tarrantino draws no interesting characters--even with two skilled and charismatic leads in Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. The most interesting character is definitely that of Butch the boxer, and even he is little-defined.The performances of all involved were fine, since the characters required so little, highlighted by Bruce Willis (oddly enough) and Samuel L. Jackson and lowlighted by the ever-horrible Patricia Arquette, who can do more to ruin an easy character than any actor I have ever seen this side of Kevin Costner and Patricia Clarkson. The parade of stars seemed to be Tarrantino's attempt to distract from the film, but it wasn't successful, since most of the actors were people who have horrible taste in general (Mr. Travolta, that's your call) and this was like a concatenation of all their wrongdoings.Meanwhile, Tarrantino the director does not distinguish himself in one way or another. It's a fairly standard-looking film that doesn't jump out of the mainstream at all, which was actually rather effective since the violence then seemed much more commonplace, but I don't know that it was Tarrantino's intention. I think if he intended that sort of theme, he would have used a more close up-laden style, so I doubt that he intended to be dull.The film's few redeeming moments were packed near the end, with a hilarious scene of Bruce Willis choosing a weapon with which to kill some tormentors and a look on his face at the end of said scene that is absolutely priceless leading the pack, but a few other good comic moments come near the end and perhaps make up somewhat for the mess that came before them.Overall, I consider ""Pulp Fiction"" a terrible mess of a script with no characterization, bad dialogue, a wildly disconnected story, and no reasons for anything that was directed decently if not well and enacted as well as possible considering its horrendous flaws. The film is most certainly not the masterpiece it is made out to be; it is more the accident it least wants to be. I would suggest it if you don't mind violence and want a good nap, but that's it."
19/07/1999,9,"This movie is the one you can watch over and over and over and over and over! Awesome! The characters, one liners, scenes, music etc etc. This movie needs no more critical reviews, and i'm not a film critic."
08/07/1999,9,"When it comes to Quentin Tarantino OP delivers and this movie is by far one of the best four in one stories or tales of violence and redemption out there. True that the actors are pure talent but in connection with a mind-blowing storyline the result is easy grandiose. Words cannot dare to describe what feelings you may have while watching. Crime, drama, thriller and a little mystery in a Tarantino movie can overcome decades of action movies. The point is that i'm not trying to praise the director in any way, I just think that it's a must to express warm approval or admiration of him. Genius minds are a rare occasion to come in contact with. GG Tarantino !"
08/06/1999,9,"If you haven't seen pulp fiction yet you are missing out on one of the best films of our generation.  Violence, sex, drugs, and more coarse language than you can count, but put together in an intelligent, intriguing manner rather than a ""Hey, come look at this controversial stuff,"" manner.  The dialogue is the best of any movie I have ever seen and quite probably the best ever.  Great acting around the board (including three Oscar nominations), especially Samuel L. Jackson. Very near perfect, very difficult to top."
23/05/1999,1,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time."
20/05/1999,1,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
29/04/1999,5,"I watch it last night after reading millions of praising reviews for it and i was hoping i would see a spectacular classic movie but i was disappointed a lot..I agree Music was good..great cast..but something was lacking in it...movie ends and i was hoping it should have better end although climatic speech was good..... some 3 interrelated stories are combined by the Tarantino..dialogs are average entertaining with lots of f stuffs..you would hate scene of accidental shootout and cleaning brains stuffs after it so it's cruel, stupid, idiotic. It's full of violence & f-words to the point that it's sickening...it should be carefully viewed and analysis....you can have glimpse of dark humor..yeah i agree acting of Uma Thurman is good but why the hell Travolta nominated for Oscar.. but two and a half hours was too long in my view ...I will give it 7 out of 10 due to good casting and music and its average movie for me but it does not deserved in IMDb top 250 and it was not touching in any sense.."
10/04/1999,4,"How this movie even got filmed is beyond me.  It is nothing but glorified crime wrapped in a lame attempt at philosophy.  I watched this at the recommendation of my friends, who both said that it was a brilliant film, and that it had very hilarious scenes.  I found no humor, no plot, and no point to this trash.  Shame on Sam Jackson for starring in this piece of trash, as well as everyone else who appeared in this film.  Tarantino should never be allowed behind a camera again!Avoid at all costs....you may lose respect for the actors involved. I sure did."
30/03/1999,1,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time."
12/03/1999,1,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
18/02/1999,8,"Pulp Fiction is a perfect demonstration of the brilliant mind of Quentin Tarantino. Not only does it have an all-star cast including numerous A list actors, with especial stellar performances from the stories main duo of John Travolta and Samuel Jackson. But despite the superb cast and amazing story, the most stand out part of this movie is the creative way it was told. Not only was this creative but it was also executed flawlessly, at no point does one feel lost or confused throughout the entire movie, adding a new spin on on the genre. This is by far Tarantino's best work, and a personal favorite."
02/02/1999,8,"I am no film geek, I don't know much about films and haven't got that scheme of noticing the values of movies... yet I can say that this masterpiece is a 10/10 material.
Oh man!
I consider the atmosphere in movie as probably the most important thing (although, there are exceptions), if I can't feel the movie I know it's not going to be superb. But with Pulp Fiction I felt ripped off the world we live in and put as an observer in it. I enjoyed every single second of it... and boy was the soundtrack great (Urge Overkill - Girl You'll Be a Woman Soon <3).
Open up Netflix on Saturday night, turn off the lights, lay down comfortably in bed and enjoy!"
31/01/1999,8,"People who don't understand this movie, have probably seen it only once. I remember the first time I saw it. I thought it was cool and so on, but I didn't get the hype about it. Surely the storyline isn't that good?Well, then I watched it again. And again. And again. This is a masterpiece, not because of the storyline, but of those who make the storyline.This movie isn't about who's the hero, what you win in the end or the survivors of something. This movie is about people, people just like us.The characters couldn't have been better. In any other movie, if a boxers girlfriend started talking about that she wants to eat a pie, I couldn't care less. In this movie, you care. Yes, its great that Tarantino made a ""pulp fiction"" of the movie, but the strongest card is the characters.The acting is great, the music is good, the directing is super. This is the Movie with a big M.So, if you've only watched it once and don't get it, please watch it again. You wont be sorry."
09/01/1999,9,"If one movie has everything in it this is it. From hit men, to romantic dinners this one has it all. The movie follows an odd sequence and kinda skips around, but in the end it's better that way. The movie casts a memorable performances by Sammuel L. Jackson and John Travolta followed by gorgeous and catchy dialouge of QT (i.e. ""I just shot Marvin in the face!"")that never lets down on the viewer. Heed the definition of ""pulp"" that's at the beginning of the movie, otherwise you might walk away a little disappointed. Weather you're in the mood for action, comedy, drama, or all of the above this movie will deliver with satisfaction."
08/01/1999,9,"Pulp Fiction is the cult and best film of Quentin Tarantino's directing career. One of the best films of the 90s and probably the best black comedy comedy. A magnificent non-linearly filed plot with several papallelic stories. Chic cast and a few iconic scenes. Pulp Fiction has both neo-noir and black humour. Pulp Fiction is a cultural phenomenon that will be relevant outside of time, this film has had a great influence not only on the genre, but also on the entire world cinematographer. After almost 30 years, no one else took off something better than Tarantino. Not many movies like Pulp Fiction have so many parodies and references in other movies or TV shows."
07/01/1999,9,"Years ago it was a cool thing to love and worship Pulp Fiction, it was cool to talk about it with friends, to quote from its characters, to perform those dance moves at parties and to even dress like Jules and Vincent. Nowadays, things have got somewhat a spin to them. It's not cool anymore to rate Pulp Fiction as one of your favorites, but these days the cool attitude is not to like this film, to dismiss it as a petty entertainment and to call it devoid of any artistic values.But, to me at least, trends don't matter. What matters is quality, greatness and influence a certain film comprises and when I think of Pulp Fiction, I think of a timeless masterpiece and a sacred haven for cinema lovers. This film has one of the best (if not the best, period) usages of unconventional/non-linear narrative that works so mind-blowingly well and adds a lot to the overall experience. All of the actors are fantastic but the dialogues and witty lines between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta are truly peerless.It certainly doesn't hurt this film's reputation when considering the fact that Guy Ritchie's entire filmography exists because of it, or countless other witty crime features that came after, only hoping to achieve some of what Pulp Fiction took home. To summarize, this film is so good that even its own director Quentin Tarantino had not been able to make another on nearly as good as this chef-d'ouvre."
04/01/1999,9,"What else is there to say about Pulp Fiction that has not been said? I am tempted to stop writing here but a one-liner review is never going to do justice to Quentin Tarantino's cinematic masterpiece. So, if you will, let me ramble.After the breakthrough at Sundance that was Reservoir Dogs (1992), one would be hard-pressed to find a film-making talent as precocious as Tarantino at that time. Here was a man who, before he started making films, worked in a video store. Such was his fascination for movies that he began to write stories while at work, obviously influenced by the culture he was immersed in.What happened afterwards was the stuff of legend. His ""stories"" became Reservoir Dogs, and two years later, he made the Palme d'Or winning Pulp Fiction at age 31. To my knowledge, the only American filmmaker I could think of who won the coveted Cannes award at a younger age was Steven Soderbergh for Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) at 26.The fear of making an explosive debut like Reservoir Dogs is that it is tricky to score again. With Pulp Fiction, Tarantino not only scores but has created the perfect goal for himself. Easily one of the top ten films of the nineties, Pulp Fiction is a lengthy film that weaves four stories together in a non-linear narrative structure that continues to impress with each viewing.The four stories are as follows: One, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are two mob hit men who work for Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), a ruthless gangster boss, and are assigned to retrieve an important suitcase. Two, Vincent is tasked by Marcellus to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for the night leading to an unexpected circumstance. Three, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), a boxer, betrays Marcellus by not losing his match, and runs away with his betting money instead. Four, two small-time robbers are dining in a restaurant when they decide to spontaneously rob its patrons.One way or the other, the four tales are linked to each other. Expertly crafted by Tarantino (who won an Oscar for original screenplay together with co-writer Roger Avary), Pulp Fiction pushes the envelope for cinema writing, influencing a new generation of filmmakers such as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Amores Perros, 2000; 21 Grams, 2003). While it takes some time to understand what Tarantino is trying to do, there is never a moment of confusion in his storytelling.The performances in the film are outstanding, and are made even more memorable by the brilliant interchange of dialogue among the characters. The signature Tarantino verbal banter is laced with witty remarks and nonsensical debate over irrelevant issues from foot massages to quarter-pounder burgers. Tarantino picks at the itsy-bitsy of American popular culture and brings his stylish brand of film-making to the forefront of that very culture he is trying to redefine.Pulp Fiction's lasting legacy lies not only in its imitable screenplay (there are so many quotable lines), but how it revitalizes a tired genre – the gangster crime-thriller – to suit contemporary tastes. As much as the film is about violence, drugs and sexual fetishes in suburban America, it is also a powerful tale of redemption, most notably encapsulated by a thought-provoking monologue by Jules in the final act, which in itself, is a stunning closure to its prologue.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
15/10/1998,10,"Samuel L. Jackson as a philosopher hitman along with his drug addicted, but intelligent 'devil's advocate' partner, John Travolta, steal all the pulp out of this fiction. You can see right through the performance of these two screen professionals and glimpse a personal 'meshing'  between two on screen artist. (However, I tend to think that someone mixed up the Oscar's between these two, no matter).The rest of this all star cast, freed up under the direction of Quentin Tarantino, shine like the Milky Way, on a clear night along the equator. Amanda Plumber, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel and the supporting cast bring a cheap paper back novel to life on the silver screen.The segments with Trovolta and Thurman in the 1950's motif restaurant, and Jackson, Travolta, Plummer and Roth in the coffee shop are 'just' unforgettable.If you love cinema, this is a must see. Be forewarned, however, that the film is graphic and Tarantino uses a device sometimes seen in literature and less often in cinema, namely, and non linear and disjointed timeline (his trademark). Just go with the flow and enjoy one of the best cheap novels that you've never read."
09/10/1998,10,"before having the pulp fiction dvd, i had heard people say it so brilliant again and again. in the top 250 movies list, it ranks 19. and i knew it had won the best film award in 1994 Canne. naturally, i should be longing for this movie for years, just as for memento, usual suspects or mulholland drive. yes, i found it at last in the dvd shop. i would not wast a second to play it in my laptop. roughly 3 hours' glance imprinted another classical in my mind. Queutin, the director, is a genius. the theme of love and redemption was presented in such a moving way.  the 3(or 4) seem to be independent, while they are inter-related. the chronical order of narration was broken apart and replaced by a confused disarrangement. in the second scene, jules shot a man down for his boss and then the movie turned to the fourth secene when jules and vincent were already in their boss' place. only at the end of moive, the skipped part of jules' redemption, the main theme of the film, was presented on the screen. why this?? the period of the rougly 3hours of the film is simply indicating the whole long process of jules' salvation. the magic bullets inspired jules of god's love that persuaded him to put the pistol aside in the restaurant and quit the gangs life(he did do so, for in the latter part he didn't show again); however. in contrary, vincent didn't realize this and stayed in, thus he was killed by potch just like a tomato that failed to catch up getting smashed up and becoming ketchup! this movie deserves such a reputation and is worth reviewing hundreds of times. thankx, Queutin!"
28/09/1998,10,"I can't tell exactly how many times I've seen this precious gem of American cinema. All I know is that it goes from early childhood up until current time and I never get
tired of it, there's always something new and fresh to explore at each view. A masterpiece of modern time that conquered audiences around the world and cemented Quentin
Tarantino as one of the greatest film authors of all time. ""PULP FICTION"" redefined cinema in so many ways that to number all of those techniques and movements would be an
understatement, not to mention most film buffs already know everything about the movie. From its peculiar and original screenplay structure to John Travolta's new rise in
Hollywood, this movie covers so many things that the movie is already legendary for its innovations.If you haven't seen it yet I'll wonder in what planet you're living. This movie is amazing, spectacular, funny, tense, thrilling, quite romantic, violent, filled with
intelligent, long and memorable dialogues, and quite memorable characters played by huge names such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Eric Stoltz,
Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel just to name a few and if all those names can't convince you to stop whatever you're watching and go seek this movie right now
then I don't know how else to convince you.Here's a movie that deals with themes of crime, loyalty, camaraderie and the lack of it, the things that matter in one's life and how at each corner of that crazed
violent city anything go right or wrong in a matter of seconds, and it's all a matter of luck or pure divine intervention as one character claims after bullets fired at him
don't even get near him. A movie with an incredible chronological time that challenges its viewers in trying to solve this magnificent puzzle of sorts, tied with countless
iconic lines that stays in your mind for a long time. And oh the glorious soundtrack with hits from decades prior to the film storyline, from Chuck Berry to Urge Overkill, but
all that we remember and defined the 1990's cinema was ""Misirlou""by Dick Dale played during the glorious opening credits.Quentin grew a lot after this movie with bigger budgets and more incredible stories but one thing is certain: that certain sense of innocence brought on by this movie
and ""RESERVOIR DOGS"" could never be repeated. This is a must-see for all film lovers out there, specially those who enjoy new cinematic languages, specially one that gave us
many other copycats - but the majority of them failed badly in trying to imitate its rhythm, its scheme and its prose. A perfect 10 out of 10."
13/09/1998,10,"I don't know what everyone is talking about, but watching the back of my hand for two hours while a small cat constantly bit me was way more entertaining than watching this movie. I'd put off seeing this movie for years for fear of being bored. Unfortunately, when it was forced in at a party, I couldn't escape. I sat there like a normal person awaiting a plot and something entertaining. However, the words ""I don't get it"" and ""God please make this end!"" were constantly repeated in my head over and over again. I think Tarintino is one of a kind and in a good way. I just don't get what's so great about this movie. Bottom line, I still believe that when too many stars enter a film, it will suck. Maybe one day I'll be proven wrong."
11/09/1998,10,"There is not much the talk about this , it's already a masterpiece that does not really tell you a message or anything, and this is what makes it perfect , isn't it already ''pulp fiction'' . The acting and soundtracks are amazing. The last scene , the talk , is the best scene in the movie and what makes it the best is there is no relevance to anything in the movie at all, Samuel L. Jackson deserves all the credit tho."
20/08/1998,6,"This movie has is all.. Good actors, good story, and a helluva ""speed"" all through the movie.. You will never be bored when watching this movie.. With so many good actors in one movie, you could think that it would not be a good movie. But In my opinion, This is the Best movie John Travolta & Laurent Fishbourne ever acted in.. They both are in their peak performance.. One very cool thing about this movie, is that you may THINK, that you know whats gonna happened next... But believe me, you don't have a clue... I have seen this movie at least 50 times already.. And I could easily watch it 50 times more, without getting bored.. It deserves a BIG 10/10..If you haven't seen it, go get a copy immediately.."
14/08/1998,6,"Set in Los Angeles, the story brings a series of events where violence and the criminal underworld go hand in hand. Among the main stories told, we have gangsters Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and his partner Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and mob boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and his wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). All the characters are somehow related. However, this is just a preface to the unbelievable plot that Tarantino develops.Once again, the filmmaker remakes, in his image, the referred resource of non-linear montage, something he had already outlined in his first film, but which, here, is part of the structural foundations of the narrative progression. We see some great unquestionable classics like ""Citizen Kane"", ""Rashomon"" and ""Annie Hall"" who have ventured down this path, with undeniable success, but with a very personal style of the director, but which was only really possible thanks, again, to the impeccable work of his late longtime partner Sally Menke in the editing room.See, for example, the time jump that Tarantino makes in the middle of the film, when we see little Butch (as an adult, the character played by Bruce Willis) receiving a visit from Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who had lived with his father when the two were prisoners of war. This whole scene, which tells a story only with a long monologue by Koons in a unique long shot, which does not deviate from the character, aims to demonstrate to us the importance of Butch's father's watch. This happens right in the middle of the interrupted narrative that Tarantino imposes on us, but when the flashback happens, we accept it naturally, without being surprised or without even for a moment failing to understand what is happening. Today, we might find this obvious and unimaginative, but try to transport yourself to 1994, when Tarantino released Pulp Fiction at Cannes almost as an experimental work and received a standing ovation for long minutes, walking away with the Palme d'Or.The dialogue, in principle, is detached from the action: the henchmen discuss snacks and foot massages, this on the verge of forcibly collecting a debt. However, exactly in this opposition - followed by attraction - between speech and event, lies one of the greatest assets of ""Pulp Fiction"". The somewhat nonsensical staging of Tarantino, a filmmaker accustomed to mixing genres, giving them a pop look and giving the pastiche a paradoxical originality, embraces almost to perfection both the types given to verbiage before and after killing, and the subtexts that are not rancid and seasoned with irony.Who can forget the twist danced by Travolta and Uma Thurman, she, the wife of the mafia boss, that is, who he can't think of touching for fear of jealous reprisals? And what about the injection of adrenaline whose effect is to ""resurrect"" the same woman, rescuing her from the land of the dead by overdose? ""Pulp Fiction"" advances out of chronological order, packaged by, perhaps, the most expressive and functional soundtrack of Tarantino's career, composed of hits such as: You Never Can Tell, Girl You'll Be A Woman Soon, Son Of A Preacher Man, among others. In the scene in which Butch (Bruce Willis) listens to the plan to deliver a certain fight, for example, Let's Stay Together, a well-known romantic song, plays, here serving as a sonorous and, therefore, dramatic counterpoint to the dismayed face of the impotent boxer in the face of the cruelty of the world and his own weakness.Each of the narrative lines that populate this film in episodes of Tarantino is riddled with dialogues that function as an expansion of what we saw in his first work. While his first film had dialogues that were limited to the same circle of people composed of gangsters or bank robbers of Caucasian origin, in Pulp Fiction we see a profusion of different characters in a duo dynamic (or almost): the couple of amateur robbers who opens and closes the film (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer); assassin duo Vincent Vega (John Travolta, revived by Tarantino) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) on a mission; crime boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and boxer in the twilight of his career Butch (Willis) encountering rapists Zed (Peter Greene) and Maynard (Duane Whitaker); Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) dealing with a heroin overdose and drug dealer Lance (Eric Stoltz) and his wife Jody (Rosanna Arquette) and Vincent, Jules, Jimmie (Tarantino himself) and the ""resolver"" of problems"" Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel) dealing with a nasty situation involving blood and brains splattered in a car. Tight or semi-tight stories sewn together by a single theme in a film that tells them out of order, but brilliantly connects them.Each dialogue is carefully tailored to work with your character and the respective interaction with the other character. There's a bit of everything, in addition to Tarantino's incredible ability to insert pop culture mentions at every turn. The phrases about the small differences between Europe and the United States, about the ""medieval acts"" of Marsellus over Zed, about the quotation from the Bible that Jules uses before killing and several others are, if you like, as empty of content as they are full of meaning. Of rhythm; or as full of social criticism as we choose to imagine, but not forgetting that many of them are taken - some word for word - from previous works in yet another demonstration of Tarantino's ability to remix what already exists and transform it into something of his own. The result is entry of all of them and more into the general culture of moviegoers (who often don't even know they are quotes of quotes) and casual viewers alike. And all this married with a surgical choice of songs for each moment, each situation, in an anthological soundtrack, perhaps the best of its kind, in yet another amazing demonstration of musical curation by Tarantino.In ""Pulp Fiction"", Tarantino inserts quotes, dialogues and situations that bring direct relationships or allude to elements, mainly, of pop culture. Among the director's influences are Western films, as well as other noir films, such as ""Band à Part (1964)"", by Jean Luc Godard. This, in this case, inspired the dance of Uma Thurman and John Travolta. Other movie references are displayed when Butch chooses a weapon to return to the basement. The hammer is related to ""The Toolbox Murders (1978)"", the baseball bat in the best style of ""Walking Tall (1973)"" and ""The Untouchables (1987)"", the chainsaw to ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)"" and ""The Evil Dead II"" and, finally, the sword, the chosen weapon, makes analogy to several samurai films. In addition, the mixture of long dialogues with explicit violence makes the plot even more interesting, as well as the suspense created around the stories, which are gradually revealed. Still, some elements are fraught with uncertainty. This is the case with the suitcase of the mobster Marcellus. After all, what was in that briefcase? This is really a mystery, Tarantino himself said that its content is not of great importance, what matters is to whet the public's curiosity and give continuity to the plot. This type of resource is used in some audiovisual productions and is known as ""MacGuffin"", a term created by filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock.The more we unravel the timelines of the film, the more attached to the narrative we become. In this context, we observe the cycle between past and present, like the story of Butch and Captain Koons. Here, we follow Butch's troubled origins and draw a ""justification"" for his actions - not that this cancels out the character's responsibility, nor does it romanticize him. The question is, first of all, to understand the causes and consequences of the acts of the represented types, through acidic dialogues and remarkable flashbacks. After all, the construction of the figures is so careful that it is difficult to fully demonize or humanize the characters.In direction, Tarantino focuses excessively on the expressions of the figures that make up his work, turning the minimum into maximum detail. The actors' body language, for example, is extremely valued here, through frames that facilitate the connection with the audience. ""Pulp Fiction"" offers a true festival of unforgettable scenes. Perhaps most remembered is Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace's dance, but there's also Jules' speech before killing his targets, the talk of uncomfortable silences, the controversy over how sexual a foot massage is, and much more. The filmmaker uses and abuses symbols that strengthen his objective and, essentially, the development of the narrative, through an obscure, tense and challenging scenario. About the performances, it is valid to point out the incredible harmony between the cast. Interpreters of Mia and Vincent, and exhaling overwhelming chemistry, Uma Thurman - Oscar nominated for supporting role - and John Travolta steal the scene and masterfully defend their characters, raising the level of both to another level.Not behind his colleagues on the scene, Samuel L. Jackson - also nominated for an Oscar - stands out brilliantly with his Jules and turns him into the best performance in the film, being valued as he deserves. A golden trio.With a rare authorship and an easily identifiable style, Tarantino, already at the beginning of his career, consolidated himself as one of the main creative minds of his time and, although he was not the precursor of the tools he uses, the familiarity with which he travels through the various possibilities that the audiovisual offers make clear the reason for its outstanding position among peers. Remembering 'Pulp Fiction' as his best work is far from being a consensus, but it was a watershed for a successful trajectory and a milestone in the history of cinema."
14/08/1998,6,"As years pass and I get older, when speaking to people many years my younger and inevitably getting to the topic of movies and film, this is always the first one I enquire if they have watched, and also inevitably demand it is the next thing they watch.It remains possibly the most entertaining script to cross genres, I don't feel you can really pigeon-hole this to a genre, it has a bit of everything. It's one of a select few films you wish you could watch again for the first time, but watching it for a second, third, eighth, tenth time... it still feels fresh and still makes you laugh.The casting is just spot on, and the performances across the board are so memorable, even the bit-parts. I have watched this so many times I could probably recite the entire dialogue with a high degree of accuracy. As many a good film I have seen I would be hard pressed to state a better script, I can't think of many, if any lines of dialogue that don't need to be there. That is an outstanding achievement.
On top of this there's also the awesome soundtrack, when I first saw this I can't say I had heard any of the tracks before, subsequently it was one of the first soundtracks I bought the CD. As with Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's choice of music was incredibly effective for the vibe of the film.There is some violence but it is not gratuitous and adds to the story. Now stop reading this and go watch it."
10/08/1998,6,The most amazing film from seeing it the first time in the mid 90s today has lost none of its magic from the opening scene with shades of reservoir dogs start in the restaurants. The simple setting with immediate addictive dialogue hooks you from the beginning. It is long before the film takes off to a new never before level of movie making the visual brilliance of the scenes and stories The intertwining of the different tales into each other the choice of order and the eventuality of being let back to the beginning makes this for me one of the all-time greatest films and from the very first viewing knowing this is going to be one of the worlds greatest directors. so many amazing performances career defining roles for stars at the top of there games actors aided by an amazing script. which still to this day is timeless like Reservoir dogs before it how to tell when it was supposed to be set what year? which just helps to make the film still perfect 30 years later. Stories could've just as easily be made into three four five maybe even six movies instead what you have is it beautifully mix intertwining timeless tales told by a master who's love of cinema is all over this movie.
07/08/1998,7,"Sucked in by the tremendous hype surrounding this movie, I went with eager anticipation.  As I waited (and waited) for something to happen in this long-winded spectacle of gore, I found myself laughing only to break the tension. I was ashamed for finding humor in the most inappropriate moments of this film.Over-indulgent pop-icon Quentin Tarantino should head back to the video store so as not to inflict this kind of mess on innocent filmgoers again."
06/08/1998,7,"Samuel Jackson, John Travolta , Bruce Willis - Can this get any better ? The dialogues are exquisite.. You will love the 'Ezekiel 25:17' and will learn and say it every time u watch it !! I can go on and on writing a review. But all i really wanna say is PLEASE WATCH. If you've watched it already, then WATCH IT AGAINAt any point of time, if you find it confusing, Don't worry, that would have happened to everyone . Towards the end, Everything will be uncovered and there will be no questions unanswered leftI can guarantee that anyone after watching this movie will not be disappointed and will become a Quentin Tarantino fan for Life.!!Personally loved the soundtracks Cheers!!!"
05/08/1998,7,Tarantino is a master filmmaker and I was first introduced to him through this movie. This film resurrected the career of John Travolta and is the kind of film you can watch again and again. Samual Jackson is so funny and the whole plot will get your head spinning the way it cuts across time. I love this film!
05/08/1998,7,"I'm not one to rate films 10/10. But this is definitely one of those films. I adore it. Quentin Tarantino directs this stunning movie starring Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta, and Uma Thurman. It's one of the best films of all time. I don't have much more to say about it."
02/08/1998,6,"Ok, no review now because we all saw this awesome movie. The best is not the actors (despite the great Samuel L. Jackson), is I guess, the wonderful script about that kind of things that we usually in our minds we have, but that we never get out from our mouth.I mean, the silence when we talk with another, the things we know about erotism and sexuality but never talk about it, that moral and ethic we have, but never use, etc...At the end, we only may say that Tarantino do everything he could, and now, 4 years later, we may say, that this is a film for all eras, because that kind of speech is the kind we live every day, in all walks of life. Do not judge the bad words, or the places around, look for the speech... that's the real thing."
31/07/1998,9,"This is a great movie, i loved it. 10/10. Tarantino rules and i love Uma. This should have won Oscars everythings great loved it do more pals. (insert Fall Out Boy's Uma Thurman lyrics here). That part where Uma dances is great. I like her a lot. Yeah thats all i have to say. I just wanted to have all the things done in my profile thats why this review sucks. Just Waco the damn movie please. I HAVE TO WRITE SO MUCH!? WHY? I just want all the things done in my profile. I hope you are going to see this movie. Like its really good. Im serious when i say that I'm so sick of this. But, on the movie, its awesome, great, dope, cool, amazing..."
30/07/1998,9,"So this movie contains the best acting roles in the respective careers of John Travolta, Samluel Jackson, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis. On top of that, and maybe in support of that, it has the best dialog ever seen in a movie.What more do people want? This is a masterpiece, in a totally different category than anything Tarrantino released before or after.And people who don't like excessive violence, more than 10.000 people are shot to death each year in the states. So really open your eyes, it is not like this comes from nothing. This movie is completely realistic in that aspect."
