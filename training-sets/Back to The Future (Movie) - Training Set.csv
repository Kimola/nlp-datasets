"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Back To The Future Trilogy

"As a child, I used to watch this movie religiously. I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!",Nostalgia

"Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.
One of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics.",Nostalgia

"One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters.

"One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters.

"My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack.A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids of their own, theirs will too.

"I admit to having grown up on 1980s films and thus having a special admiration for them. Whichever way you look at it, BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era, a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.The underrated Michael J. Fox stars in the role of his life as Marty McFly, a guy who unwisely gets involved in time travel thanks to the machinations of his kooky inventor buddy, Doc Brown. Christopher Lloyd essays this subsidiary character and, again, it's the role of his life; he's over the top in it but nonetheless his character is thoroughly endearing and never less than hilarious.The time travel aspects of the storyline are carefully worked out and hold together very well even today, some 30 years after release. What I particularly liked about this film is the calibre of the writing: there's no slow spots or simplicity here, just one suspenseful sub-plot after another. There are small moments, big set-pieces, cutting edge special effects, action, chase scenes, romance, and of course plenty of humour, and a quirky supporting cast who make the most of their roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic - and for good reason.",Nostalgia

The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any).

Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any).

"What do you say about one of the most entertaining films ever made? This movie is so beloved that I can't imagine anyone is coming to a review site to read what people think to get help deciding if they should see it or not. It's full of great characters, unique situations, and fun moments. It's packed with action and humor. Marty and the Professor are iconic roles performed wonderfully by the lead actors. Almost forty years later and BTTF is still a household name and part of our shared film culture. You see a Delorean, you think of this movie. It is endlessly satisfying to watch, and my only criticism is that there are one or two sequences that are drawn out for suspense that aren't really necessary. But that is just one guy's nitpick. Most people will find this to be a near-perfect viewing experience.",Nostalgia

"I saw this movie 10 or maybe 15 years a go. Naturally I liked ""Back To The Future"" as every kid did. So, after a decade and a half last week I've decided to see it again, and man was it a cold shower.OK, let's be honest, Back To The Future films are meant to be a fictional comedy and you can't expect any complexity or dramatic twist. A cool kid with ambition and a classical nutty professor type join their forces in a time traveling adventure. Sounds like a cool plot for the 12-15 generation, but that's as far as it goes. I still find it entertaining yet the simpleness of the whole story does kill the excitement a bit. Also, the commercial aspect of the movies is insultingly obvious. Come on... Pepsi, Delorean, Nike, Toyota... it all shouts of sponsorship and it's placed without any effort of subtleness. It's like the whole budget was dependent on the good fortunes of the sponsors, thus making a movie into an expensive and long commercial. Overall, entertaining, relaxing but that's about it.And another thing. This is not SF!Science Fiction - Fiction based on scientific facts. Flux Capacitor and time traveling dogs are hardly supported by science. Very few films dubbed SF fulfill the standards overall. Adventure, fantasy, comedy, fiction... ""Back To The Future"" is all those things, but SF it ain't!",Nostalgia

"I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of ""Doc"", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong.",Back To The Future Trilogy

The music is wonderful, you'll be singing along.The acting is superb, Michael J Fox is just great as Marty, Christopher Lloyd is awesome as the wild eyed Doc.I would say it's the perfect Boxing Day film, but it's one of those awesome movies that you'll enjoy any time, and with the whole family.A fabulous movie.10/10.",Nostalgia

"When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"Okay, so maybe ""Back to the Future"" seems a little hokey, but it's so cool! You probably know the story: typical '80s teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back to 1955. His existence is threatened when his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) falls for him instead of his father George (Crispin Glover). Only the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) can help him. Along the way he has to cope with local bully Biff Tannen.If the movie is excessively nostalgic, then they play it to good effect. I sometimes have to wonder what would happen if I accidentally went back in time and met my parents. Given what happens in this movie, it's probably best that I stay in my own time.Anyway, it's an interesting contrast/comparison between the '50s and '80s. After all, who in the '50s would have imagined Reagan becoming president, or any town having an African-American mayor? So check this movie out; it won't disappoint you.",Time Travel

"I just asked my friend that I'm speaking with through instant messenger if he had ever seen ""Back to the Future"" and he said ""Yeah, who hasn't?"", sadly, I never had the opportunity until tonite and he called me a failure as a movie buff, well, at least I've seen the movies now! Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.10/10",Back To The Future Trilogy

"Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.

"I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,""Back to the Future"" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the ""Twin Pines Mall"".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B.

"What else needs to be said? Anyone that knows anything about filmmaking knows that this is the best film ever made. Try watching certain movies over and over and see how quickly you get sick of it. This movie is different. The depth and richness of storytelling, the characters, oh my, the characters. Doc Brown is easily one of the best and most memorable on screen characters in any film ever. Biff, Griff, Buford...best on screen bully ever! Compare this movie to other epic movies, such as Star Wars - while those types of movies are great in their own right, Back to the Future is different. There is a warmth and comfort to the way that Bob Gale and Bob Zemekis crafted this screenplay. It's pure genius. And for all of you fans that always have to mention ""plot holes"" or ""minor flaws"" - please make sure you have seen every second of the 25th Anniversary set of the trilogy that has an entire bonus disc, as well as more bonus features and two different commentaries on the main discs. Bob Gale is aware of every little detail about his script and talks about it in the commentaries. My true love of this film came as a result of watching all the behind the scenes material - which if you haven't seen, you must see it if you're a fan of this movie. It will give you a whole new level of appreciation for this film. As someone that is into filmmaking and a total nerd about directing, cameras, technical details, I can't get enough of watching and listening to these guys talk about how everything came together just right for this masterpiece to happen. I can't say enough about this film, its actors and all the people involved in making it. Truly something not to be rivaled and we will probably never see anything close to it ever again.",Character Development

It's no surprise that this film is praised by so many people. This movie is very exciting and fast paced. It doesn't take long before Marty finds him self traveling from 1985 back to the 1950.

"The first time I watched this movie was back in 2019. I saw it on Netflix and my dad told me how he remembered watching it in theaters back when it came out in '85 and said he loved it. This made me curious so I watched it. The whole movie just has a great story, great soundtrack, wonderful characters, is funny, and the special effects were pretty great for a 1980's movie. I can't remember the amount of times I've re-watched this movie since then, all I know more than 20 times. This movie is so memorable and made me fall in love with the BTTF trilogy.

"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? And Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"It's 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn't capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn't get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.It's honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable.

"It's 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn't capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn't get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.It's honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable.

Dr.Emmett Brown a crazy, funny scientist invents the time machine, the biggest dream of his life. And Marty who is his friend gets to be a part of this awesome adventure by mistake. The best thing about this movie is how it shows whatever happens is bound to happen whether you want or not. And how with change in your attitude or with some help you can completely change your whole life. ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" - Dr. Emmett Brown Back to the Future is an amazing movie.

I've watched this and About Time which are movies about time traveling and both are awesome. BTTF is TOO Awesome. Couldn't believe this was a 1980s movie.BTTF trilogy is an incredibly awesome adventure taken by Marty McFly and Dr.Emmett Brown. Dr.Emmett Brown a crazy, funny scientist invents the time machine, the biggest dream of his life. And Marty who is his friend gets to be a part of this awesome adventure by mistake. The best thing about this movie is how it shows whatever happens is bound to happen whether you want or not. And how with change in your attitude or with some help you can completely change your whole life. ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" - Dr. Emmett Brown Back to the Future is an amazing movie. This 1985 movie is so much better in quality as compared to the movies nowadays which have a shallow impact on the audience. You will actually feel connected to the movie and glued to your seats till the end There are not many movies of 8.5-like rating which are packed with Comedy, Drama, Adventure of such level... It's a MUST WATCH for all.Hope you all enjoy it too. Cheers!",Audience Reception
"What to say about Back to the Future? A trilogy that animated my childhood and continues to do so with as much panache and reverence as it did when I first laid eyes on the duo of Doc and Marty. A friendship that shouldn't exist, yet the chemistry that binds them is uniquely special and fluently conferrable on screen.Not a Sci-Fi person? No need to be - this is packed with action, emotion and intelligence. It feeds the curious and demanding brain with complex twists and turns, and characters overlaying each other in a vast time continuum.These films are clever, sinuous; they are peppered with flashbacks and parallelisms, thus keeping you entertained throughout. Expect great one-liners (""Where we're going, we don't need... roads"").It's undoubtedly the trilogy with the most re-watchability in existence, excepting, perhaps, the original Star Wars tri.BTTF contains all the key ingredients you want in a great film, from great characters to great storyline and brilliant music to accompany and set the tone each scene. It had me on tenterhooks throughout, and I am not an easygoing cinema critic.I can't, can't recommend it enough. After watching all three films, your life will forever be richer.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"I first saw this movie way back in 1985 when it came out on VHS video. I rented it out from one of my local video rental shops and absolutely loved it. I watched it twice that night and again the following morning before I had to bring it back.
This movie is a great family sci/fi comedy that captures the imagination. At some point in our lives we've all wished we could travel through time - I know I have.
This movie has great adventure, thrills and laughs that should not be missed, nor should the sequels. A terrific all-round joyride that you'll enjoy time and time again.
In recent times I bought the trilogy on DVD, so as to enjoy the movies whenever I want, and trust me, I do.
I fully recommend this movie and the sequels. Both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are perfectly cast as the time travelling duo. So, what are you waiting for?",Nostalgia

"When this came out over 20 years ago, I thought It was solid entertainment with a clever story. It was a big hit, and spawned two sequels. I saw it at the theater and several times on VHS. Then, after an absence of time, I saw it again in the late '90s and was shocked to hear 11 blasphemes - a ridiculous amount for a comedy (and ""PG-rated,"" to boot).Also, the character ""Biff"" (Thomas Wilson) was so irritating to me (he must have done a good job acting) it also fun out of viewing. I could say the same about ""Marty's"" father (Crispin Glover), who was a disgusting wuss. I did enjoy seeing Lea Thompson in her prime: a very pretty woman, and there were still a lot of laughs in here. She and Christopher Lloyd's ""Emmet Brown"" are definitely fun to watch. Michael J. Fox became an even-bigger star, thanks to this movie.The mixture of humor, action, drama, special-effects, science-fiction, etc., all made this a film a lot of people enjoyed. Why they had to include all that ""language"" is a mystery to me, except that it's the twisted world of Hollywood.",Nostalgia

"OK...it looks like I'm the only person in civilization that hates this movie. I was at a friend's house, and it was rented for part of the evening's entertainment. I saw it way back in 1985 when it came out, and I did not then have any particularly hostile feelings toward it, but after seeing it again recently and looking through the comments on IMDb, I must conclude that it is the most overrated film ever made.A quick browse through the comments yields such superlatives as, ""Fantastically scripted sci-fi comedy!!"", ""The perfect movie package"", ""One of the most original idea ever to put on film""(sic), and ""One of the best movies ever made in the history of film making."" Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, I guess.Plot-wise, this movie is as sit-com formulaic as they come. I can see how the pitch went to get this film made. ""We'll make an episode of Three's Company meets Happy Days with some time travel in it!"" I must also point out that this film is not science fiction. It is fantasy.Maybe this is my own personal problem, but science fiction should make some attempt at plausibility. This movie relies on a device called the 'flux capacitor' that requires gigawatt's of power and a DeLorean moving at 88 miles an hour to function, although why this is the case and what the device does is never even vaguely delineated. The film would have been just as plausible if it involved a wizard that zapped people back in time with a medieval talisman and an incantation that required precise rhythm and pronunciation. It might even have been more plausible that way.I suppose it's the 'science fiction' of it that really honks me off. It seems that so many people regard this film as good sf, and it is not. If you want a good example of sf, look at Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Many people find that film confusing and impenetrable, but good sf usually takes some work to appreciate because it deals with concepts that most people haven't thought about. This film just takes a formulaic stroll through a combination of well-worn clich��s to be found all over situation comedies and time travel stories. Come to think of it, Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys deals with the time travel concept far better than this film does.OK, this isn't to say the film has no redeeming qualities. It does have some amusing moments. As a sit-com, it's OK. For comedy in science fiction, though, the Fox network show Futurama is vastly better.",Time Travel

If you want a good example of sf, look at Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Many people find that film confusing and impenetrable, but good sf usually takes some work to appreciate because it deals with concepts that most people haven't thought about. This film just takes a formulaic stroll through a combination of well-worn clich��s to be found all over situation comedies and time travel stories. Come to think of it, Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys deals with the time travel concept far better than this film does.OK, this isn't to say the film has no redeeming qualities. It does have some amusing moments. As a sit-com, it's OK. For comedy in science fiction, though, the Fox network show Futurama is vastly better.",Nostalgia
"OK...it looks like I'm the only person in civilization that hates this movie. I was at a friend's house, and it was rented for part of the evening's entertainment. I saw it way back in 1985 when it came out, and I did not then have any particularly hostile feelings toward it, but after seeing it again recently and looking through the comments on IMDb, I must conclude that it is the most overrated film ever made.A quick browse through the comments yields such superlatives as, ""Fantastically scripted sci-fi comedy!!"", ""The perfect movie package"", ""One of the most original idea ever to put on film""(sic), and ""One of the best movies ever made in the history of film making."" Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, I guess.Plot-wise, this movie is as sit-com formulaic as they come. I can see how the pitch went to get this film made. ""We'll make an episode of Three's Company meets Happy Days with some time travel in it!"" I must also point out that this film is not science fiction. It is fantasy.Maybe this is my own personal problem, but science fiction should make some attempt at plausibility. This movie relies on a device called the 'flux capacitor' that requires gigawatt's of power and a DeLorean moving at 88 miles an hour to function, although why this is the case and what the device does is never even vaguely delineated.

"Today was the day me and my best friend from high school-who now works at the movie theatre that is showing these Back to the Future trilogies-saw these again, a little more than 30 years after this first one initially came out. Because the second one took place partially on October 21, 2015 was the reason for this series playing for that one day. Anyway, this first one was the best of them mainly because of the contrast between teen Marty McFly's '80s lifestyle and that of his parents' when they were teens in the '50s. Also, his relationship with Doc Brown was also a big part of the movie's phenomenal success. That and plenty of jokes about culture shock and great chase scenes. My favorite scene involved Marty playing heavy metal licks at the '50s dance sequence. And what great players like Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd handling their roles the way they do! And, yes, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson are also fine as Marty's parents and his father's bully, respectively. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale fashioned a fine screenplay with excellent direction from Zemeckis. This is still my favorite '80s movie, bar none! So on that note, I definitely highly recommend Back to the Future. P.S. One of the most interesting things I now know about this movie is that the younger brother of Lorraine in the '50s sequence was played by Jason Hervey who was also in the other summer blockbuster of the summer of '85-Pee Wee's Big Adventure-and would later play Kevin Arnold's older brother, Wayne, on ""The Wonder Years"".",Back To The Future Trilogy

"I always regard the eighties as the weakest decade for movies. Short running times were filled out with one dimensional characters and thin plots, patronising audiences with their banality. Some thought John Hughes was a genius, and everyone liked Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thankfully, there were the occasional gems in the mire, and Back to the Future ��� a family film with daring themes of incest and attempted rape ��� is one of them.Michael J.Fox is excellent as Marty, though you can't help thinking someone as boyish and short could never really be so cool. And I always thought it was irresponsible for a film to show such potentially fatal activities as skateboarding on the back of vehicles. Then again, how sensible can you be when your main songs are by Huey Lewis and the News?Still, eighties haircuts and braces as fashion statements not withstanding, this film holds up remarkably well. The heavily signposted coincidences and plot developments are fun, while the support work well, particularly Crispin Glover as Marty's dad. A number of ""blink and you'll miss it"" pieces add to the enjoyment, especially an advert on the back of a newspaper Marty picks up ��� which can only be seen clearly via freeze-frame ��� proclaiming: ""You'll be noticed driving the car of the future"".Direction could occasionally afford to be a little more cinematic in its approach (note how Marty films the Doc's experiment on a camcorder but we never see the camera's perspective; possibly because it's an obviously fake camera with no recording light) but generally it's sound. Christopher Lloyd's overacting could also grow irritating for some. Evidence of mild product placement does not really hinder the piece, and the evocation of 50's Middle America is quite charming.Maybe there's the nagging feeling that ��� now fifteen years old ��� the film's cultural parodies seem hopelessly naive in their application. Constant references to Star Wars, Ronald Reagan and Jackie Gleason don't seem as fresh or relevant as they once did. Back to the Future is an okay film, and an amusing diversion. But its lack of realistic characterisation and mainstream trappings make it an entertaining pile of fluff, nothing more.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"Back To The Future is one greatest films ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,an amazing score and soundtrack,a fantastic script and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future one of the best films of the 1980s that is Popcorn entertainment at it's best.Set in the fictional town of Hill Valley,California,Back To The Future tells the story of teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox). who is asked by his friend eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd)to help him on experiment a time machine made out of a Delorean car. After an unfortunate incident Marty gets into the time machine and is accidentally transported back to 1955 where he not only meets Dr. Brown but also meets his parents George(Crispin Glover)and Lorraine(Lea Thompson)as teenagers. With the help of Dr. Brown Marty must find a way to get back to the year 1985.Released in 1985,Back To The Future is a brilliant and entertaining film that was without a doubt the biggest Box Office hit of 1985 grossing over 300 million dollars world wide and is just an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is one of those movies that is the definition of what a blockbuster should be and where everything from the direction,the cast and story work to absolute perfection with no false note or missing beat. I don't think director Robert Zemeckis or the cast knew what they had was something that was special,magical and timeless and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and will continue to be enjoyed by past,present and future generations. The movie is also the first feature of one of the most beloved movie trilogies of all-time and while all three Back To The Future films are classics as a whole the first is still the best. What Back To The Future does so well is that it takes the time travel movie and gives it style and creativity mixing together different movie genres Comedy,SCI-FI,Action,Romance and thrills giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink but the movie never becomes uneven or confusing making Back To The Future one of the best genre mash-up movies I have ever seen. Although there are some serious moments Back To The Future is lighthearted with non-stop fun From beginning to end,Back To The Future has an energy and flow that just never stops and keeps you glued to the screen with relentless pace and excitement that makes the film re-watchable and iconic to this very day. The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is incredible and quotable with tons memorable scenes and dialog that are funny done with perfection and fun as well with ingenious style and rapid fire delivery that is wonderful. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF are hilarious and fun with moments that are over the top and great thanks to the actions and reactions of Marty and Doc Brown and the main characters. The SCI-FI scenes in BTTF involving the Delorean are so dazzling and are done with imagination and beauty that will make your jaw drop and it doesn't matter how many times you see BTTF you will be blown away by the Delorean sequences. There have been many classic movie duos throughout cinema and among the great duos are Marty and Doc. The scenes between Marty and Doc are truly funny with terrific back and forth banter and have some of the best scenes in the film that are unforgettable. While the two are different in personality and are separated by age the two have a friendship that feels genuine and real where you feel that Marty and Doc would have each other's back at all costs. The friendship between Marty and Doc is further cemented in Part II and III where you feel they will be friends forever whether it's in the future or in the present. Marty and Doc are two amazing and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. The ending of Back To The Future is terrific,thrilling and filled with surprises that will leave viewers laughing and smiling. A fantastic ending.The cast is wonderful. Michael J. Fox is excellent and funny as Marty McFly,with Fox bringing laughs and charisma to the role. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as Dr. Emmett Doc Brown,with Lloyd being delightfully over the top and having a fantastic chemistry with Fox. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are wonderful as Lorraine and George McFly,Marty's parents. Thomas F. Wilson is terrific and fun as Biff,a neighborhood bully. James Toklin is great as Mr. Strickland,a hard nosed principal. Claudia Wells(Jennifer),Mark McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Sperber(Linda McFly),Jeffrey Jay Cohan(Skinhead),Casey Siemaszko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),George DiCenzo(Sam Baines),Francis Lee McCain(Stella Baines),Harry Waters Jr.(Marvin Berry),Donald Fullilove(Goldie Wilson),Will Hare(Pa Peabody)and Norman Alden(Lou)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is amazing,with Zemeckis always moving the camera while giving the film with great camera angles,pace and atmosphere.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding and one of best scores in movie history,with Silvestri's score being epic,suspenseful and uplifting. Incredible score,Silvestri. There is also a great soundtrack featuring songs by Huey Lewis And The News(The Power Of Love and Back In Time).The Special Effects by Industrial,Light and Magic is dazzling and visual stunning and will blow your mind. Great effects,ILM.In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI,Robert Zemeckis or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Back To The Future,one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent,unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"Back To The Future is one greatest films ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,an amazing score and soundtrack,a fantastic script and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future one of the best films of the 1980s that is Popcorn entertainment at it's best.Set in the fictional town of Hill Valley,California,Back To The Future tells the story of teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox). who is asked by his friend eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd)to help him on experiment a time machine made out of a Delorean car. After an unfortunate incident Marty gets into the time machine and is accidentally transported back to 1955 where he not only meets Dr. Brown but also meets his parents George(Crispin Glover)and Lorraine(Lea Thompson)as teenagers. With the help of Dr. Brown Marty must find a way to get back to the year 1985.Released in 1985,Back To The Future is a brilliant and entertaining film that was without a doubt the biggest Box Office hit of 1985 grossing over 300 million dollars world wide and is just an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is one of those movies that is the definition of what a blockbuster should be and where everything from the direction,the cast and story work to absolute perfection with no false note or missing beat. I don't think director Robert Zemeckis or the cast knew what they had was something that was special,magical and timeless and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and will continue to be enjoyed by past,present and future generations. The movie is also the first feature of one of the most beloved movie trilogies of all-time and while all three Back To The Future films are classics as a whole the first is still the best. What Back To The Future does so well is that it takes the time travel movie and gives it style and creativity mixing together different movie genres Comedy,SCI-FI,Action,Romance and thrills giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink but the movie never becomes uneven or confusing making Back To The Future one of the best genre mash-up movies I have ever seen. Although there are some serious moments Back To The Future is lighthearted with non-stop fun From beginning to end,Back To The Future has an energy and flow that just never stops and keeps you glued to the screen with relentless pace and excitement that makes the film re-watchable and iconic to this very day. The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is incredible and quotable with tons memorable scenes and dialog that are funny done with perfection and fun as well with ingenious style and rapid fire delivery that is wonderful. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF are hilarious and fun with moments that are over the top and great thanks to the actions and reactions of Marty and Doc Brown and the main characters.

"Back To The Future is one greatest films ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,an amazing score and soundtrack,a fantastic script and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future one of the best films of the 1980s that is Popcorn entertainment at it's best.Set in the fictional town of Hill Valley,California,Back To The Future tells the story of teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox). who is asked by his friend eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd)to help him on experiment a time machine made out of a Delorean car. After an unfortunate incident Marty gets into the time machine and is accidentally transported back to 1955 where he not only meets Dr. Brown but also meets his parents George(Crispin Glover)and Lorraine(Lea Thompson)as teenagers. With the help of Dr. Brown Marty must find a way to get back to the year 1985.Released in 1985,Back To The Future is a brilliant and entertaining film that was without a doubt the biggest Box Office hit of 1985 grossing over 300 million dollars world wide and is just an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is one of those movies that is the definition of what a blockbuster should be and where everything from the direction,the cast and story work to absolute perfection with no false note or missing beat. I don't think director Robert Zemeckis or the cast knew what they had was something that was special,magical and timeless and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and will continue to be enjoyed by past,present and future generations. The movie is also the first feature of one of the most beloved movie trilogies of all-time and while all three Back To The Future films are classics as a whole the first is still the best. What Back To The Future does so well is that it takes the time travel movie and gives it style and creativity mixing together different movie genres Comedy,SCI-FI,Action,Romance and thrills giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink but the movie never becomes uneven or confusing making Back To The Future one of the best genre mash-up movies I have ever seen. Although there are some serious moments Back To The Future is lighthearted with non-stop fun From beginning to end,Back To The Future has an energy and flow that just never stops and keeps you glued to the screen with relentless pace and excitement that makes the film re-watchable and iconic to this very day. The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is incredible and quotable with tons memorable scenes and dialog that are funny done with perfection and fun as well with ingenious style and rapid fire delivery that is wonderful. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF are hilarious and fun with moments that are over the top and great thanks to the actions and reactions of Marty and Doc Brown and the main characters. The SCI-FI scenes in BTTF involving the Delorean are so dazzling and are done with imagination and beauty that will make your jaw drop and it doesn't matter how many times you see BTTF you will be blown away by the Delorean sequences. There have been many classic movie duos throughout cinema and among the great duos are Marty and Doc. The scenes between Marty and Doc are truly funny with terrific back and forth banter and have some of the best scenes in the film that are unforgettable. While the two are different in personality and are separated by age the two have a friendship that feels genuine and real where you feel that Marty and Doc would have each other's back at all costs. The friendship between Marty and Doc is further cemented in Part II and III where you feel they will be friends forever whether it's in the future or in the present. Marty and Doc are two amazing and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. The ending of Back To The Future is terrific,thrilling and filled with surprises that will leave viewers laughing and smiling. A fantastic ending.The cast is wonderful. Michael J. Fox is excellent and funny as Marty McFly,with Fox bringing laughs and charisma to the role. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as Dr. Emmett Doc Brown,with Lloyd being delightfully over the top and having a fantastic chemistry with Fox. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are wonderful as Lorraine and George McFly,Marty's parents. Thomas F. Wilson is terrific and fun as Biff,a neighborhood bully. James Toklin is great as Mr. Strickland,a hard nosed principal. Claudia Wells(Jennifer),Mark McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Sperber(Linda McFly),Jeffrey Jay Cohan(Skinhead),Casey Siemaszko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),George DiCenzo(Sam Baines),Francis Lee McCain(Stella Baines),Harry Waters Jr.(Marvin Berry),Donald Fullilove(Goldie Wilson),Will Hare(Pa Peabody)and Norman Alden(Lou)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is amazing,with Zemeckis always moving the camera while giving the film with great camera angles,pace and atmosphere.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding and one of best scores in movie history,with Silvestri's score being epic,suspenseful and uplifting. Incredible score,Silvestri.

"Now here's a film that manages to engender nostalgia for two different decades, while still remaining timeless. You don't see that every day. Strip away the ILM effects, space-time wrinkles and polished veneer and ""Back to the Future"" is really just about a kid witnessing his loser middle-aged parents during their high school years. It's such a novel idea and the movie that builds on that is just so precisely tuned. This was never a big effects movie and never promised huge Summer spectacle, but it does offer the honest thrill of going on an adventure. And that's tough to beat. It's got everything: action, science fiction, comedy, a teen movie subplot and (most importantly) an endearing relationship between two memorable characters (and let me say this right now: Christopher Lloyd steals every one of his scenes).For me, this is the total package of pure entertainment. It's lodged itself into the cultural lexicon and for very good reason. ""Back to the Future"" has been my favorite for years, and I just don't see that changing anytime soon.

"The movie takes us on a great time travel where a teenager McFly meets his parents when they were teenagers. He both needs to get back to 1985 but before that to get his parents to fall in love with each other so he doesn't get erased from the existence.The movie is absolutely great. It has so much energy and there is always something happening. It is also great to look into the past. Nowadays 1985 is old times as well so the movie has twice the charm when we get to see both the 80's and the 50's. And the writers did a great job to make jokes to show us the differences between those times. Even as somebody who hasn't lived in the 50's I could get them, and the jokes about let's say Marty's 80's vest are even more hilarious to us now. So the movie aged very well, if it didn't even get better.The casting is also perfect. Michael J. Fox is the right actor for Marty. He was not the one cast at first but I am so glad they got him. Even though Eric Stoltz is a great actor, but the footage with him from Back to the Future had a more serious feeling to it, it kind of was losing the charm I love so much. Maybe then there would be no other sequels.Christopher Lloyd created a great persona as Doc. If I see a picture of him I would always recognize him. He always has this great crazy scientist in him. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover who played Marty's parents made a wonderful performance by being them at different ages. The make up artists also contributed to the success of it.I loved this movie as a kid, I love it now. It has everything that I like for such a genre: great cast, a fun story, great lines, well connected plot and perfect time setting. One of the movies I can watch again and again.",Time Travel

Even though Eric Stoltz is a great actor, but the footage with him from Back to the Future had a more serious feeling to it, it kind of was losing the charm I love so much. Maybe then there would be no other sequels.Christopher Lloyd created a great persona as Doc. If I see a picture of him I would always recognize him. He always has this great crazy scientist in him. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover who played Marty's parents made a wonderful performance by being them at different ages. The make up artists also contributed to the success of it.I loved this movie as a kid, I love it now. It has everything that I like for such a genre: great cast, a fun story, great lines, well connected plot and perfect time setting. One of the movies I can watch again and again.",Cinematic Techniques
"The movie takes us on a great time travel where a teenager McFly meets his parents when they were teenagers. He both needs to get back to 1985 but before that to get his parents to fall in love with each other so he doesn't get erased from the existence.The movie is absolutely great. It has so much energy and there is always something happening. It is also great to look into the past. Nowadays 1985 is old times as well so the movie has twice the charm when we get to see both the 80's and the 50's. And the writers did a great job to make jokes to show us the differences between those times. Even as somebody who hasn't lived in the 50's I could get them, and the jokes about let's say Marty's 80's vest are even more hilarious to us now.

"Fresh off the success of ""Romancing the Stone"", Robert Zemeckis parlayed his newfound clout into the highest grossing movie of 1985 - ""Back to the Future"". A combination of science fiction and nostalgia, the movie touched a chord with contemporary audiences and continues to resonate with viewers thirty years later.The movie's protagonist is Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time thirty years. After he unwittingly prevents his parents' first meeting he must make things right or else he'll nullify his own existence.Although the premise is science fictional, the treatment is more or less fantastical, with only a superficial attempt to explain the technology behind time travel. Regardless, the souped-up DeLorean and its flux capacitor make for an iconic time machine.Meanwhile, the Oscar-nominated original screenplay offers something for everyone. In addition to the overall element of science fantasy spectacle there's action, adventure, romance, comedy & even surprising dramatic depth at times.However, the story may not have come to life so vividly without the movie's well-assembled cast. Replacing Eric Stoltz after shooting had already begun, original choice Michael J. Fox was thankfully able to accept the lead role at that juncture. Today, it is difficult, if not impossible, to envision anyone better suited to the role of Marty McFly. In support, Christopher Lloyd is likewise irreplaceable as Doc Brown. The icing on the cake is Marty's parents, enthusiastically played by the lovely Lea Thompson and the always interesting Crispin Glover.Zemeckis's direction also leaves little to be desired. The movie has an attractive look throughout and even the thirty year old special effects have held up pretty well. Musically, the movie benefits greatly from Alan Silvestri's rousing orchestral score. The pair of soundtrack contributions from Huey Lewis and the News are also memorable.Overall, ""Back to the Future"" offers high concept thrills backed up by considerable film-making prowess. Iconic in many respects, the movie is among the best, and the most entertaining, of the 1980's.",Time Travel

Was that on earth either before or after a couple of months in 1985?That said, Crispin Glover should have gotten an Oscar for his performance as Marty's dad George. He takes the generic nerd written in the script, chops it into kindling, and uses it to set the screen on fire.

"Part I is certainly the cleverest of the three. A rip-snorter of a premise: Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back to 1955 in the time machine that his friend Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, in a zany, unforgettable, over-the-top performance that creates one of the best characters of all time) has built, and he accidentally interferes in the meeting of his parents, so that instead of his grandpa hitting his father (Crispin Glover in another over-the-top but crucial and memorable performance) with his car, he hits Marty instead. So instead of Marty's mother falling in love with his father, she falls in love with him! Controversial and awkward though it may be, you can't deny its greatness. The real aim of this, though, is not incest, its learning what his mother was really like in her youth, compared to how she tells it. Plus, it lends a certain urgency to what Marty must do to set back the course of time, which makes us need to watch till the end to see he does it: he must somehow make his parents meet and fall in love, or he won't be born!The second main quest in the movie is the technical problem of getting Marty back to the future: since in Part I the time machine runs on plutonium, and plutonium doesn't exist in 1955, they have to find some other way of generating the 1.21 gigawatts needed to get the car to 88 miles per hour and send it into time.The third main problem of the movie is that on the day when Marty got sent back in time, in 1985, Doc will be shot by Libyan terrorists for stealing their plutonium to run the time machine, unless Marty does something about it. A terrific feature of these movies are their climaxes: Part I is a terrific scene where Marty must hit the power line connected to the clock tower at 88 miles per hour at the precise moment lightening strikes it, involving a reference to a famous silent movie image, of Harold Lloyd hanging from a clock high on a building in Safety Last (1921).Back to the Future pulls a lot of old punches, uses a lot of traditional storytelling gags and devices that feel quite familiar, but its unabashed sense of fun, larger-than-life tone and ripsnorter premise make it the kind of movie you treasure and watch time and time again.",Time Travel

"Part I is certainly the cleverest of the three. A rip-snorter of a premise: Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back to 1955 in the time machine that his friend Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, in a zany, unforgettable, over-the-top performance that creates one of the best characters of all time) has built, and he accidentally interferes in the meeting of his parents, so that instead of his grandpa hitting his father (Crispin Glover in another over-the-top but crucial and memorable performance) with his car, he hits Marty instead.

"I was on a cross-country plane ride recently, and I noticed that Back to the Future was one of the movies available as one of the in-flight entertainment options. I'd seen it as a child in theaters and maybe one other time since, so I thought I'd see if it held up. Granted, I'm not a kid anymore, but I wondered if there might at least be some nostalgia value. Sadly, no. The problem is that since the last time I saw Back to the Future, I'd gotten myself a TacStorm. I couldn't help but fixate on the places where a continuously firing gun would've changed everything.For example, when the Libyans track down Doc Brown in the parking lot, all he has is a revolver that doesn't even work. Imagine if he had an automatic handgun that was already firing on its own before the Libyans even arrived, and all he had to do was aim. I realize he has to get killed for there to be a movie, but I still couldn't get over the absence of the TacStorm. Unfortunately, the movie was pretty much tainted 20 minutes in and only got worse.In the climatic scene where George McFly knocks out Biff with one punch, all I could think was how he could've easily missed or not hit him hard enough to knock him out-just imagine what would have happened to him then. But if he'd had a gun that was always firing, there'd be no doubt, just guaranteed security when he needed it most. I realize the movie was made before the TacStorm was created, but that doesn't make it any more watchable in the year 2019!As it turns out, that's not the only movie that doesn't age well because it doesn't have a TacStorm. For example, my girlfriend and I watched The Goonies recently (she had actually never seen it). She thought it was pretty good, but I said, ""You didn't notice something missing? I mean, a really HUGE omission?"" She didn't at first, but once I explained that Data wouldn't have even needed a spring-loaded boxing glove in his jacket or oil jets in his sneakers to fend off the Fratelli family if he had a gun that was always pumping out bullets, it was so obvious to her.And, sadly, even some of my all-time favorite movies have lost their luster because the TacStorm is so glaringly absent. In The Godfather, for instance, when Michael has to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey in that restaurant, Clemenza tells him not to take any chances. Well, sorry, but if he doesn't have a TacStorm, if his firearm isn't discharging continuously straight from the factory, he's taking some MAJOR chances. Plus, if he had a TacStorm, it'd still be firing when he dropped it, which would take out anyone that tried to follow him.So now I don't know if I even want to see any newer movies at all. I guess the good news is that maybe they're new enough to have the TacStorm in them, but do I want to waste money to find out? You'd think with four guys in the band, at least one of the members of Queen would have one, but I didn't see one in the Bohemian Rhapsody trailer, not to mention the trailers for Aquaman or Roma. Well, if I'm not 100% sure, I'm just going to watch some TacStorm demo videos online. At least I know they won't let me down.",Nostalgia

Beyond its dazzling special effects, the best element of Back to the Future is the performance of Michael J. Fox, who finds himself in the quagmire of surviving the white-bread 1950s with a hip 1980s mindset.",Visual Effects

"The 1985 movie ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a timeless - pardon the pun - classic. It truly is a movie that has withstood with the trials of time and proves to be a movie that you can watch again and again and it actually never loses its appeal or charm.Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale managed to put together a very original story here, one that captivates the audience from the very beginning and keeps a grip on the audience until the very end. The story told in ""Back to the Future"" is a story that has so many aspects and so many topics that there definitely is something that appeal to everyone in the audience; ranging from romance, action to science fiction.There is a great pacing to the movie, and director Robert Zemeckis ensured that the movie never left momentum or dropped down in its pacing. This definitely made the movie all the more enjoyable and certainly ensured that the movie can be watched again and again.The movie is packed with great actors and actresses. Of course the movie is so phenomenally well carried by Michael J. Fox in the lead role as Marty McFly, and he definitely made that character lovable and memorable. But right up alongside Fox was Christopher Lloyd in the memorable role as the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown. Who can't claim to be familiar with the expression ""Great Scott!""? Furthermore, the movie also brought along Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, whom individually also brought a lot of contents to the movie with their appearances and performances.I can't count the number of times that I have watched this movie, nor the other two in the franchise for that matter. But the original 1985 ""Back to the Future"" is a classic in every meaning of the word.While the movie is from 1985, then the special effects still holds solid even in 2019. Sure they wear symptoms of aging, certainly, but still the special effects are quite good. And back in 1985, they were off the charts.If you, for some unknown reason, never have gotten acquainted with ""Back to the Future"", then shame on you. This is a movie that you HAVE to watch.

Great, original story, fine acting and characterisation, fast pace, perfect musical score, satisfying ending, ah, I could go on and on.The chemistry between Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd is quite unlike anything I can think of in any other film. It is so natural, like they'd been working together for years.I tend to judge films by how many ""memorable moments"" it has, that is, outstanding scenes that you remember and want to see again and again. This film has many such, more than any other film I can think of.If you are not a film fan, or not seen this one, watch it and you'll be hooked - forever!Incidentally, the Blu-Ray rendering of this film is easily the best I have seen for a film of its age. Absolutely stunning.",Visual Effects
"""Back to the Future"" has to be one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made, including the film's movie trilogy. It was great with the movie soundtracks and the amount of comedy running through the whole thing.The movie has to be everybody's dream at some point, he starts with a family that is partially wrecked by the father's lifelong bully, alongside his friend scientist shot dead, and (by accident) fixes it all in the past. With a lot of amusing comedy moments in between, one of the classic moments was the ""I hate manure"" scenes there were in the whole trilogy.I find it rather sad that most people seem to assume that the DeLorean car in this was just a special car made for the film, because that car was actually a more efficient car made in the 80's. Kind of like 80's version of today's Toyota Prius. Too bad the movie didn't get the DeLorean more popularly bought.Oh well, ""Back to the Future"" is a great movie, and to prove this, it is still a popular movie even today.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"You should not watch Back to the Future looking for serious, intriguing thought experiments regarding time travel. You should watch it for what it is: a Hollywood blockbuster that seeks to make money through people's entertainment. And the profit-seeking motive is quite clear from the beginning: you see brand placement EVERYWHERE. Back to the Future, then, has all the ingredients for a Hollywood blockbuster: funny characters, unlikely plot denouements that you see coming way before it happens, very clich�� characters such as the town bully, the timid nerd that becomes a hero, the damsel in distress. Also, as a 1985 blockbuster, it includes racism and sexism that would probably not be tolerated nowadays, such as the main actor shouting ""the Libyans!"" as a synonym of ""the bad guys!"", or the main character literally planning to abuse of a girl, which happens to be his mother.That being said, the movie does achieve it main goal: it is truly entertaining. I'm not the kind of person who laughs out loud when watching comedies, but in this case I couldn't avoid it. There are truly remarkable situations, especially with Marty's mother. The doctor's character is also particularly well-made, and the actor's performance is notable. In general, the creators did a good job in showing all the different funny situations that would arise from bringing an 80s kid to 1955, such as him playing rock'n roll in front of an awed audience, or Marty saying that a TV program that is just being aired is a classic that he watched in a rerun.So once you understand you shouldn't have high hopes for this movie, and that you should only look for having a good time, this movie will be very satisfactory. There are more artistic movies, better written plots, better directed ones, even funnier ones. But very often, these movies don't remain in the collective imaginary in the way this did it. The way this movie is part of today's pop culture should not be understated.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"Back to the Future is one of those movies with everlasting appeal that everybody loves to watch. Who would have thought when this was released 30 years ago back in 1985 that it would forever remain etched in everyone's memories and in movie history as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time. With its cleverly intelligent story and the perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, adventure, and romance, director Robert Zemeckis struck gold with this one of a kind movie that can never be duplicated. It also goes without saying that nobody can go past Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown. Mention any of those actors and without a doubt Back to the Future will always pop up as one of their most memorable movies.Back to the Future takes place in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an aspiring musician who is dating Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and lives with his dysfunctional family. His weak willed father George McFly (Crispin Glover) is bullied mercilessly by his boss Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and his mother Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) is an unhappy alcoholic. While she disapproves of Marty's relationship with Jennifer, Lorraine recounts how she met George when her father hit him with his car. On 26 October 1985, Marty meets his friend the eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in one of his most memorable roles) at a shopping mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. When the Libyan terrorists track down Doc Brown, Marty manages to escape however inadvertently finds himself transported back to 5 November 1955. Marty finds himself in a time where his parents George and Lorraine are teenagers and are yet to meet, Biff is still a bully, and Doc Brown is still developing the very early stages of a time displacement machine but is still the same eccentric scientist only 30 years younger. Not only must Marty find a way back to 1985, but he must also not tamper with history otherwise he may never be born.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are tailor made for their respective roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown. Both of them will forever be remembered for this movie. They are just fantastic! Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have put in a lot of attention to detail with the comparisons between 1985 and 1955 as well as how the timeline may be affected for the McFly family and Hill Valley. With its quirky take on the time travel genre, the whole thing is cleverly written. The special effects for its era are top notch and Alan Silvestri's score is very memorable. Huey Lewis' theme song for the movie The Power of Love fits perfectly with the movie.I could go on forever how Back to the Future is one of the best movies of all time. What more can I say? 30 years on Back to the Future has not lost its timeless appeal and audiences everywhere get a thrill out of watching the movie. Even whenever people approach Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd the main topic of conversation will always relate to Back to the Future. Followed by two clever sequels, Back to the Future will still remain a timeless classic.A well deserved 10/10.",Nostalgia

"I know I've seen this movie before but I couldn't remember when or what happened. I kept getting it confused with Flight of the Navigator, a very similar movie in which a 12 year old boy disappears for eight years and suddenly comes back having not aged at all. Set in very similar time periods, it was easy to get them confused. Both are about time travel. One goes to the past and almost messes up history. One goes to the future after being gone for an extended period of time. Neither character look like they've aged. Marty is only in the past for a week, so you can't really age that much anyway.
When Marty McFly travels back in time to 1955 and spends that week with inventor Dr Emmett Brown who he knew in 1985. When Marty saves his father's life and gets hit by his grandfather's car, he has to figure out a way to get his parents together so that he'll still exist in the future. His father, once a poor businessman who gets bullied by his boss, becomes a wealthy author whose childhood bully becomes an employee and has to wax his cars.
After reading some of the Goofs on this site, I learned that there were quite a few historical errors, mostly relating to when a particular thing was first introduced to society. Silly things like a Pepsi thermometer in the soda shop that wasn't introduced to society until a couple years later. Or the type on a poster that wasn't around that year. Or the vibrato thing on Marty's guitar when he's playing at the dance. I've seen Flight of the Navigator a movie that takes place in 1986, a little more than a year after this movie.
Christopher Lloyd as an actor is awesome. He's played many roles in many different movies and TV shows. He voices the Hacker in the children's series Cyberchase. He's the criminal guy in Dennis the Menace. He plays as Doctor Emmett Brown in all the Back to the Future movies. He's the professor in the second season of the BYUtv series Granite Flats. He voices Rasputin in Disney's version of Anastasia. Those are just the movies and tv shows I can think of off the top of my head. How many movies has this guy played in? He plays all of his roles beautifully and I would definitely watch other movies that he's in. He's a great actor. He seems to get a lot of roles for villains and crazy old people, but he plays them well.",Time Travel

"It's fine. It's mass appeal done right, if not exemplary. And that's the slant - it feels like it was formulaicly designed to have as much mass-audience appeal as possible. Much like Indiana Jones or the MCU, this tries to take you back to those Saturday Morning Cartoons - hip young teen and his mad scientist friend and their time-travelling rock'n'roll misadventures. Oh, watch out, they have to jump-start Doc's time-machine Delorean (in earlier drafts it was a refrigerator) just in the knick of time as lightning strikes the clock tower in the town square. This movie basically demands that you watch it in your pajamas while eating cereal. The production, direction, and pace are all fine. Michael J. Fox is hilariously bad and Christopher Lloyd is clearly having fun in his over-the-top madcap role. It's a serviceable diversion, but the problem with pop-culture is that it's elevated this movie way too far above its lot.",Time Travel

Growing up I always wanted to be like Marty McFly and learning about the history of making this film, and how Micheal J Fox almost wasn't the actor, is super fascinating. The making of the movie was an absolute sh%t show and I'm surprised they finished it. Such an iconic and nostalgic film, I'll never give up the opportunity to watch it.",Cultural Impact
"Back to the Future is just one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen every time you flip by it when channel surfing you always stop on that channel and watch it again. I've probably seen this movie a 100 times since I was a kid but if I stop on HBO and its playing I just can't help but at least watch a few minutes of it before returning to my channel surfing.Michael J. Fox was the absolute best actor to choose to star in this movie, he has great screen presence that whenever he's on TV he grabs your attention. It's such a shame the health problems he has had that such great skills are going to waste.The movie has so many great lines that I still quote to this day.",Nostalgia

"My my kids got two days in a row of my pandemic Film Appreciation Course, this time introducing them to the 80s time travel classic ""Back to the Future."" My kids laughed at all the right parts, thought Marty and Doc funny, and were completely caught up in the excitement and suspense of the clocktower finale. During that clocktower finale, one of my daughters, who wasn't familiar with ""suspense"" as a film term said ""This movie is giving me ANXIETY!"" They were completely into the film, just as I was when I was 13 or 14 when I first saw it in the theater. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, who only had three movie credits to his name before this, the very funny TV movie ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" the very funny and very crass Kurt Russell comedy ""Used Cars,"" and then ""Romancing the Stone,"" which was an unexpected hit that led the studios to take a look at his other projects. If you're wondering how Spielberg got involved in this film, Zemeckis and his writing partner, Bob Gale, wrote Spielberg's infamous bomb ""1941,"" which I think is an under appreciated comedy classic I still love to this day. Spielberg also produced Zemeckis' first film ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and when the studio was uncomfortable with him selecting a first time director he stuck by Zemeckis but had to promise the studio if things went badly he'd take over as director. But I digress. In summary, ""Back to the Future"" has a great cast (even look fast for Billy Zane in his film debut as one of Biff's toadies), terrific humor, and genuine heart. Although seemingly lightweight, ""Back to the Future"" really is an American film classic. FUN FACT(s)! When Thomas F. Wilson, who played Biff, is asked about this movie by fans, he'll often hand them a postcard of frequently asked questions as a timesaver, which reads:""I'm Tom Wilson. I was in all three 'Back To The Future' movies. Michael J. Fox is nice. I'm not in close contact with him. Christopher Lloyd is nice. He is a very shy man. Crispin Glover is unusual, but not as unusual as he sometimes presents himself. We got along nicely. Lea Thompson is nice. Eric Stoltz originally played Marty, but was fired due to performance issues. The first movie was shot in 1984 and '85. The sequels were shot 'back to back,' never before attempted by a movie studio. The hoverboards didn't really fly, we were hanging by wires from a crane. The manure was made of peat moss, cork, dirt, and a food agent that made it sticky. The Delorean was an inferior automobile, and nearly impossible for a person of normal size like myself to enter and exit. There are many tiny plot points hidden in the movies, but I don't know what they are. Among many improvisations of the set, I coined the term 'butthead,' as well as 'Make like a tree, and get out of here.' The third movie was my favorite, since I got to learn western skills like riding, roping, quick draw, and shooting a six-shooter, a great adventure for a guy from Philadelphia.""",Time Travel

"I have watched this 1985 film classic Back to the Future several times now and I have never grown tired of it. Not only does it stand the test of time (no pun intended) but this family adventure just keeps getting better and better, My three sons grew up watching it with me and in the next few years into the future our first grandson will also be old enough to enjoy this treasure trove of a film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make every minute ""a must see"" with the worlds destiny imminently at stake.

"Just kidding! It is one of the best films ever made. Lea Thompson was so hot. I would ""park"" with her anyday of the week, and twice on Sundays. Doc Brown is hypocritical about knowing too much about one's own future. It is weird that Marty McFly (presumably a minor in high school) is friends with a single old man scientist. Crispin Glover is probably the best part of the movie. That dude is ultra strange! I want to see the Eric Stolz version of the film. He apparently was Marty originally and filmed a lot of the movie before he was replaced by poor Parkinson poster-boy Michael J. Fox. Truly sad what happened to Fox in real life. He was a rising star and could have done a lot more with his career. But, such is life. 88 miles per hour!",Character Development

"It has been thirty years since this movie came out, and has now become a household name as everyone around the world makes references from each scene they reenact, quote lines from each character they say and make parodies out of it. ""Back to the Future"" is one of my favorite movies, and it is one of the best if not the best about time travel. There have been plenty of movies about time travel, but when it comes to time travel movies I think of this one. So with said, the movie is about Marty McFly who accidentally goes back in time to 1955 as he alters history by saving his father from getting hit by a car, and his mother for falling in love as well as his existence. So Marty has to put it all back as how things should be, while Doc Brown tries to get Marty back home to 1985. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do work well together like bread and butter. Lea Thompson looks lovely and she really plays her role really well. The rest of the cast all did great. The movie itself is really funny, and it is also exciting too. The movie doesn't feature that many special effects by ILM, but I love the effects for the car traveling through time just as what it appears in the movie without any time travel sequence like having a portal or something. The design of the DeLorean for being used as a time travel vehicle is really iconic, and loved the way how it looks. The music by Alan Silvestri is so unforgettable, and loved hearing the theme that he created. The movie is very well scripted, and I thought Robert Zemeckis does a really good job on directing this movie after making another movie that is also good ""Romancing the Stone."" The production design for the 1955 scenes are outstanding, and I thought the pacing of the movie is top-notch. I really hope Hollywood doesn't try to remake this or the sequels, because they're fine for what they are; just like what everyone says ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I have nothing against remakes, but sometimes it just gets lazy for Hollywood to try to come up with some new stories, and new ideas for what movie is there to make. So please, for one last time as I say this ""DON""T REMAKE THIS MOVIE OR THE SEQUELS!"" Now I got that out of my way, so now I need to wraps things up with this review, ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a classic movie, and really can't say no more about it.

Back To The Future is a master piece concept which is also ful of fun but yet there was grossness and absence of ""extraordinary"" in the script.I am sure the director never thought that this movie can be such a success and that is why he never paid much attention to make it overwhelmingly smart, appropriate and courageous. No doubt one can enjoy the trilogy and feel satisfied but i see a lot of doors left open untouched which if were cared, would have given the shape of metropolis to the grandeur. The movie is awesome but not beneficial or thought provocative. I rated it less for miss or less-using and then stabilizing the special concept which leaves no ground open in the viewers to allow something scientific and technically correct. Being a great person it becomes responsibility to take care of many aspects for others which i didn't find in this movie.The amazing points of the movie includes two characters, the guy and the scientist, the most fitting comic faces to let you understand that whatever you are going to watch is going to be enjoyable. Next is the memorable vehicle that can travel in time. Third is the amazing area and landscape used to avoid the time travel giving clumpsy look. That is something intelligent film making.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"Everything about this film screams iconic. To the soundtrack to the wardrobe to the set design. The continuity itself is a cinephile's greatest discovery. How Robert Zemeckis did it, is phenomenal. Back to the Future sits high on my list as one of the best science-fiction romantic comedies of the 80s. It inspired me to become a director myself. Almost a decade after watching it, nothing else can compare.You won't be disappointed. Its heart-warming story will bring laughter and joy to your family movie night. Don't forget the popcorn and drinks because you will not want to pause it. I should warn you now, get the second and third movie. I spent one night watching the trilogy and I was highly impressed. I didn't get tired once. The plot twists kept me awake as I wanted to know what happened to Marty McFly, the main character.If you thought you had nothing in common with an 80s character, you'd be mistaken. McFly is just like you, and I. Everything goes wrong for him. But who's there to help him? His mentor and friend, Doc. We all have a Doc in our lives that we all know and love, and secretly worry for. A friend who lives on the edge. Every day is a new adventure for Marty and Doc. Whether it's scientific experiments to getting into trouble to traveling through time. Back to the Future is a movie you don't want to end. Because you're having too much fun.This movie makes you think. Not about girls, or boys. Nor romance or popularity. Back to the Future makes you think about family, friends, and the importance of our choices. To Marty, it's more important to be different than to fit in. He rather go against the status quo than to change himself to fit the past. In a world where people are bullied for being outsiders, this film teaches us to fight for our self-worth. Our value does not come from someone's opinion. It comes from within. Without self-love or self-value, there would be no you.The choices we make as individuals causes a chain reaction. What we do today has a direct impact on tomorrow, or the years to come. With actions there are consequences, and Back to the Future does a wonderful job in advising people to look closely at their actions and how it may affect them and those around them.This is not just a movie, I realized. It is a gift - from the past. A digital creation that offers advice and wisdom on how to live. As Marty McFly discovers adulthood, beside him we can learn from his mistakes and use his life lessons as our own. Whether it's through dating, going to school, being a son, being a friend, to being a hero. You will go to the past with Marty and Doc, and unlike our main character, you will never want to go back.So maybe you're just like Marty McFly - A slacker. An outcast. A rebel.Or you're just like Doc - An optimist. A creator. A visionary.If you're as lucky as I am, you're all the above.Great Scott, get in the DeLorean and buckle up. This ride was made for adults and children of all ages everywhere. What are you waiting for? Add it to your list of must watch. Huge thank you to Robert Zemeckis and the creators for changing my life. I know it will change yours!!!Similar Movies: Jurassic Park, Men in Black, Inception, E. T., Indiana Jones, Groundhog Day, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club.",Nostalgia

"Since the beginning of time we have wondered, what it would be like to rewind time, and undo those things we either did not intend to do, or to do something we should have done in the past. This could alter our lives, in the present or future as we know it. The movie Back to the Future (1985), allowed me to live this fantasy. Although, the plot was based on a realistic scientific possibility, I know it to be just a fantasy in realization.The plot was Doc Brown, (Christopher Lloyds) creation that a DeLorean could indeed travel through time. However, during a bad transaction that had taken place with the Doc, and some extremists, the Doc was shot and killed, while Marty (Michael J. Fox), the lead character escapes the shootout in the famed Delorean automobile. The car would travel back in time, to 1955, as he was driving away at a heightened rate of speed in the automobile. The thrill of this movie for me begins when Marty travels back in time, and he accidentally gets hit by his grandfather in his own car. He was then taken to his home for care, where his young mother, falls in love with him. This would create a chain reaction, which would prevent his mother and father from ever meeting and would put his own, existence at stake.Throughout this movie his whole mission was to find the old Doc, so he could help him get back to 1985. This strategic maneuvering would ensure that his mother and father met, and inform the Doc about what happens to him in the future, so he could hopefully prevent it. After all this was accomplished the goal was to dodge the character of the story, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), the young man who was head over heels for Marty's mother. Biff wasted no time clobbering Marty every chance he got, in order to make Marty's mother not like Marty, by proving that Marty was a non-worthy wimp. Overall the idea of going back in time was awesome! However, the whole idea of my mother being attracted to me was very creepy. I believe that many of the movie goers would agree with me. Yes, the technological twist, drama and theatrics were great for its time (1985); but the close relationship, between mother and son, was a little over the top for me.",Time Travel

I felt love with this movie when I first saw it. According to me it's the best sci-fi Movie.,Science Fiction
Sometimes a film comes along and the timing of its release turns out to be absolutely perfect and in my opinion this is one of those films. Everything about this film feels right and it is nearly two hours of inventive comedy and pretty much anything else you would want from a really entertaining creation. All of the people involved in the making of this film should be congratulated on a job well done. I always enjoy watching it again and I will never lose my enthusiasm for this film. The film could have been released five years before or five years after 1985 and for some reason I do not think it would have had the same effect. We will never know but suffice to say that it is a splendid romp that does not fall into the trap of being too serious and therefore works remarkably well. I would recommend this film to anyone providing they are prepared to tune into the humour and if that happens it will be guaranteed to be an enjoyable experience.,Comedy Elements

"This is movie magic at its finest.This movie is is fun, funny, captivating, enthralling, suspenseful and all around amazing.Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox are perfect in this movie, and the supporting cast are spectacular as well. Huge shout out to Tom Wilson who plays Biff as well, for being the best movie bully of all time.Now, this film- while being the best thing ever made- ever- is not without its flaws... the opening amp sequence is a bit goofy and out of character with the rest of the film, and Crispen Glover's performance may be too outlandish for some people (personally, I love him in this movie).I'm not sure that this movie is going to stand the test of time- You may have had to live through the 80s to fully appreciate the contrasting attitudes and behaviors of Marty and the people of 1955. I think the film holds up fine right now, but I wonder in 20 years if people will still appreciate its subtleties. In brief, this movie is the most fun thing I've ever watched.

"Ah, distinctly I remember, it was my grandfather (may he rest in peace) who first showed this film to me, on video when I was a very small child. It was him and his second wife, and two of their friends, and me, and distinctly I also remember vividly immediately after the film was over, I said, ""I want to watch it again!"" 30 years after its initial release, this is still a hilarious, wonderfully wacky sci-fi/ comedy/ romance/ action flick, and one of the very few films which even attempts to cover all of those bases, and does so extremely well, as it sends a 17 years old 30 years into the past in a DeLorean built by a nutjob inventor, Doc Emmet L. Brown, brilliantly played by Christopher Lloyd. An over-the-top satire of mad scientists, when he shouts, ""It works!"", it reminded me of Dr. Frankenstein shouting ""It's alive!"", upon seeing his creation. Even the film's ending still had suspense, I was still on the edge of my seat (as the clich�� goes) when Doc was on the edge of the clocktower, lightning bolts crashing and crackling, again similar to film Frankenstein's creation of the monster. There is also a sad, tragic feel to a few scenes, as Marty fears for his friend's life. As Biff, Thomas Wilson is hysterical also, the kind of over-sized nitwit most of us knew in high school, who we waited to see get their comeuppance. A childish baby, stuck in a large man's body. Some well selected and timed oldies, and original score was perfect, not a single note misused, nor was there a single line of dialogue misused, out of place, or unnecessary. The same can be said about the cinematography, which includes several of Dean Cundey's long takes (opening shot in the Doc's garage, and the unveiling of the DeLorean. One of my all time favourites, 10/ 10, easily. Upon seeing it again in the cinema yesterday (21 October 2015, Back To The Future day) me and the entire audience were in stitches all throughout, and the film actually received a standing ovation when it finished.",Nostalgia

"This year, John Hughes died, and we were reminded of the depth of his insight into subadult suspension. Being reminded of his work impressed me. What will we think when Zemeckis dies?Certainly we will be reminded of how he balanced fantasy and reality in all of his projects. Possibly it will be noted that he softened the Spielberg approach by unintuitively adding incoherence.I think I will remember two films: this one and ""Roger Rabbit."" These both are deceptively trivial. Was this the first mainstream movie that played as cleverly with time travel conundrums? It was not intended to spawn a sequel, and you can see that certain conventions were established that hurt the successors. But seen by itself, the idea of superimposing actors, characters and times in the same package works well. Makes this a gem.Notable is once again the scientist. You have only two types: pipe smoking, chin stroking blackboard thinker who explains, or what we have here. Lloyd is wildhaired, wild-eyed. A hardware guy, not an idea guy. An active risktaker, frantic in demeanor, but with apparently no sense of scope. For instance, he spends more time on a model of how to explain catching lightning than on the apparatus itself.The film revolves around his instabilities and mirrors those as instabilities in the world. It all starts when he bumps his head getting off the toilet, folded into his minute of death from jilted terrorists. Everything that follows is his wacky vision, joined by Marty when knocked out by the nuclear guitar amp.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",Time Travel

"""Back to the Future"" (1985) is a pioneering science fiction film that captivates with its innovative plot and dynamic characters. It cleverly intertwines elements of adventure, comedy, and drama, showcasing the journey of Marty McFly, who is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean created by his eccentric friend, Dr. Emmett Brown. While the concept of time travel was brilliantly executed, offering a fresh take on the genre, some aspects, like the exaggerated confrontation with the Libyans, felt overly dramatized and slightly disconnected from the storyline. Despite a few narrative discrepancies, the film remains an entertaining experience, rich in creativity and filled with memorable moments that have stood the test of time. Its charm lies in its ability to blend humor, heart, and a sense of wonder, making it a quintessential 80s classic and a fun ride for audiences of all ages.",Time Travel

"Overrated, as many later movies and shows did take the time travel theme to fascinating lengths, leaving this stuck back in time. I can understand its pioneering qualities, but now it seems dilluted, when put alongside other good works on same general topic. Spielberg had his magic, but after a while, got repetitive. Looking back, it seems clear that he tried to recapture the nostalgia of his childhood, the things those kids dreamt and imagined, which is fine in itself, but gets you only so far. The standard small town, people, relationships (popular kids, loner, bullying, lifelong archenemies) somehow feel museum like today. Without the drop of nostalgia, the movie is more like a framework of childish memories of times that are no longer and feels... Boring. A milestone, but one of a past that isn't connected to our days.",Time Travel

"This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read ""IT"" by Stephen King or watch ""Twin Peaks"" by David Lynch for examples��The next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom.The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !",Back To The Future Trilogy

As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom.The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!).

"HUGE 1980s hit movie. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox in his breakthrough role) has a miserable life. His father is a wimp, his mother an alcoholic and they live in a rundown area. His only friend is a crazy scientist (Christopher Lloyd). Lloyd turns a DeLorean into a time machine (don't ask) and Fox accidentally ends up in 1955. He also accidentally fumbles his parents first meeting--so his mom is falling for him! He has to get his parents together...or he won't exist. And how is he going to get back to 1985?Sounds silly but this actually is a lot of fun. The direction is good and the script is fast and very funny--I LOVED Lloyd's reaction to Reagan being president and Fox dealing with 1950s life. Also the 1950s outfits and cars are incredible. SPOILER!!! It does go a little too far at the end with Fox supposedly inspiring Chuck Berry--but that's a small complaint. END SPOILER!!! The acting is good. Fox and Lloyd are both great and play off each other very well--some of Fox's dead pan expressions to Lloyds ravings are quite funny. And Fox is so YOUNG! Lea Thompson was excellent playing Fox's mother--she convincingly ages herself AND looks like a teenager. Crispin Glover overdoes it though as Fox's father--TOO over the top. Also great to see Frances Lee McCain playing Thompson's mother--this woman is a great actress and played mothers through many great 1980s film (like ""Footloose"", ""Gremlins"", ""Stand By Me"" and into the 90s with ""Scream""). Also Billy Zane (in his first role) appears as a bully--but has no dialogue.Only two things spoil this a little. The open ending (it ends with ""to be continued..."") and the constant product placement--I know a lot of movies do it but here it was virtually nonstop! When it starts calling attention to itself that's a problem.Also Huey Lewis and the News (remember them?) had a big hit with the opening song ""The Power of Love"".

"I literally made an account just to give a review to this movie and express my appreciation. I have to start by saying that the actors were absolutely amazing. They captured perfectly that revolutionary atmosphere of the 80's. I actually feel what is like to be a teenager in that period just by looking at the way they act. The script and the way it is made OMG i seriously don't know where to begin. All the jokes and punchlines are so carefully implemented, this movie has so many references to both real things like the joke with Ronald Reagan and things from the bttf universe, to give an example it would be the continuous repetitions that are always placed cleverly and even if you get a feeling of what is next you always end up satisfied. What this movie really tries to emphasize is that history repeats itself and that we create our own destiny. The amazing thing about this movie is how Marty travels back in time, a place where we believe we know everything about and we are somehow still mind-blown by every character and action and feeling .You just cannot not get that chill when u think of how irreversible time is and the way this movie captures all these emotions is simply extraordinary. The best movie experience i've ever had!!!",Nostalgia

I didn't fall in love with the ""Back to the Future"" series, but I see its appeal.Grade: B+",Character Development

"As much as I like back to the future and the trilogy the films don't make sense as many things are time paradox's although not as present in this film as the 2nd it does have many mistakes which make you think ""great Scott"" how does that work.The storyline is good as it has made several parodies and we even get a second glance in the second film the casting works well although going back in time is something new plus martyrs reaction to the 1950s is like going to new country they do things differently theirThe film where the storyline makes sense is interesting where Katy is forced into last resorts to get his parents together but in the end he has destroyed his life as he no longer knows what as happens in his life it is different nowAll in all the movies good but it like I said has several plot holes which need filling.",Time Travel

My favorite scene of the movie was when he came back to the future and his dad had a new car and was making his bully wax it. One personal experience to this movie is sometimes I talk such long naps that I end up feeling like I slept through a couple of years. The filmmaker is telling you that you should be glad you didn't go to school with your parents. They are also telling you that when your mom is hitting on you things can get a little weird. I knew in this part if history that women wore dresses. I also new they didn't have super nice cars. Something that is similar to this time in history is that people are still super clingy in relationships. I have not seen movies by this director. I think this was a good movie. I wouldn't mind seeing other movies by these people. I think the actors did a really good job. I liked the camera angles they were different from what you normally see. I don't think this is a movie I would watch outside of school. If I were to recommend this movie to someone it would be to my parents.,Time Travel

A true classic, the story was great, along with the characters, and the soundtrack. It was the perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy,action. Doc Brown (Lloyd) invents a time machine using a DeLorean, to escape some Libyan terrorists after the Doc, McFly (Fox) goes back in time to 1955, and must use the assistance of 1955 Doc Brown to get back to 1985.

For kids: Noo. 12 or 13+ in my opinion.But still, this movie does it and is way better than the DC crap coming out recently.

"Had to have been one of the greatest films I have witnessed. Watching this when I was younger had such a great impact on my life growing up. By far, this is the best movie to ever cover time travel, and maintain a realistic path. I encourage any movie goer to first watch this film before any that bend the time barrier. Some of Michael J Foxx and Christopher LLoyd's best work. This is when Universal Studios and Sony realized that there was something to control in order to move the people and they ran with it. This film is one of my top 10 to watch and re-watch. Timeless and for the ages will forever be watched/remembered. I will be sure to show this film to my children. If they do not witness this movie, they may never know what it feels like to travel through time and still connect to the present. I thank producers for making movies as such.

"I like this movie okay. It was not something that I would really want to have in my DVD collection as I am more into horror than comedy, but this movie was entertaining. This is mainly due to Christopher Lloyd than anything else, the man brings real energy to his role. Michael J. Fox was good to in the lead role, one has to wonder if ""Family Ties"" held him back a little as he had some rather successful movies during the 80's and could have done more without the television commitment. This one is about time travel, time travel to the past. The next film would feature time travel to the future and the past. That one is a film I can not watch, it is just to hard to for me. It also has not aged well as the future they paint is a future of the 80's, as fashion is never going to be like that I am afraid. This one though has a guy use the professor's time machine and ending back in the past where he kind of interrupts the first meeting of his mother and father. This in turn makes it so he may no longer exist shortly. Thankfully, the professor is around and so he has to work on getting the time machine, which is a car, in working order and Fox has to work on getting his parents back on the right track. Like I said, this one works, as you can recreate a time that is past, the second one doesn't because you can not see what the future is going to be like. The third one though was okay.",Time Travel

Fox was good to in the lead role, one has to wonder if ""Family Ties"" held him back a little as he had some rather successful movies during the 80's and could have done more without the television commitment. This one is about time travel, time travel to the past. The next film would feature time travel to the future and the past. That one is a film I can not watch, it is just to hard to for me. It also has not aged well as the future they paint is a future of the 80's, as fashion is never going to be like that I am afraid. This one though has a guy use the professor's time machine and ending back in the past where he kind of interrupts the first meeting of his mother and father. This in turn makes it so he may no longer exist shortly. Thankfully, the professor is around and so he has to work on getting the time machine, which is a car, in working order and Fox has to work on getting his parents back on the right track. Like I said, this one works, as you can recreate a time that is past, the second one doesn't because you can not see what the future is going to be like. The third one though was okay.",Comedy Elements

"I digged this movie as a kid. It was crazy scientists and fun action. And nobody could envision what the future would look like. Now, I'm in my fourties, the era they travelled to has passed, and I watched this again.First, nothing in this movie feels realistic. The family of Marty feel like a bad fever dream of a horrific past. Caricature dynamics that hammer in how crap of a life the ""kid"" has (Michael J. Fox was in his middle thirties at he time). The professor angle, well, nobody over 10-years old buy into that guy. He build a fantastical time machine out of a car for crissakes, an doesn't seem to understand anything about how something works, except through magic and unbelievable ""epinaphies"". They have an adventure, albeit, magical in nature, and learn a thing or two (banal) things about life. It's filmed really good, the actors are for the most part ok, but the story doesn't really make any sense if your'e not a kid born in the eighties with poor understanding of physics and science.",Time Travel

"Marty is a high school student who, by an unfortunate coincidence, travels thirty years into the past and prevents his parents from meeting each other. In order not to be erased from existence, he must now find a way to unite them and secure his own birth, as well as to return to his time.This SF comedy is perhaps the greatest classic of its genre. If there are some who have not seen it, at least they have heard of it, and references from the film have long been implemented in pop culture. Fast-paced, fun, witty, with top effects for its time, a multi-layered story that stimulates thinking and awakens the imagination, and accompanied by great music, this film aged well and is as impressive today as it was at the time of its creation.

"The epitome of excellence in Hollywood, ""Back to the Future"" is timeless, inspiring, and memeable. The pace here is seamless, every moment has plot significance, and every word uttered is valuable and meaningful. This careful crafting of visual presentation, audible experience and narrative concept existed at a time of relative peace and stability in the American economy. Little did we know everything would go downhill from here: an era of complete uncertainty leading to massive corporate greed, a sharp drop in production quality, and an industry absorbed by politics instead of artform. The laisse faire attitude of 80s Hollywood management allowed for more directorial creativity and oversight, compared to the complicated and overzealous requirements demanded by today's itchy fingered producers and executives.""Back to the Future"" deals with very common human issues such as self-esteem, effort and maturity, all while presenting an intriguing premise, pressing matters, romance, friendship and conflict all rolled into one. If the definition of Art is ""the mirror we hold up to ourselves"" (Shakespeare, Hamlet), then the imitation of nature that this science fiction dramedy presents is among the best in the craft of filmmaking: It's not about the science or the fiction; it's about people.Today's world poses many threats to studio success: legal action can be taken if your production presents defamatory or misleading information; social backlash can arise from a lack of respect to the genre or franchise; studio acceptance can be jeopardized from simple misrepresentation of race or gender... what we have now is a literal minefield of judicial hurdles, social media timebombs and the precarious balancing of identity politics over qualification and competence in hiring. Its no wonder, then, that activists, poles, statistics and even artificial intelligence have taken center stage in the development of studio projects: every obstacle to success must be accounted for. The excessive hand holding has led to a soulless industry, one so obsessed with minutia, that its now incapable of seeing the forest from the trees. Art has completely left the building, replaced by obligation to pretense and the third quarter. Hopefully, future generations will rely on past productions, such as this one, for inspiration, guidance, and understanding of the human experience.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"This movie is one of my favorite classic films, but for me I actually watched it in the theater when it first came to the big screen. It has always been one of my favorite for as long as I can remember. I have had to have watched this film very many times and recommend it to everyone!",Audience Reception
"I saw this film at a pre-release Manhattan screening in 1985 and enjoyed it (mainly due to Michael J. Fox's performance), but found it contrived and hokey overall - too much nostalgia and cutesy scenes playing down to the audience. Boy, was I wrong.I hadn't watch it again for nearly 40 years, but caught it just now on TV (with commercial breaks, yet) and can now admire the Bob Gale/Robert Zemeckis screenplay that makes the central time travel premise fun and ingeniously sets up so much clarity to seeming ""coincidences"". Even the in-jokes like Calvin Klein lead to further humor in sequels, like Fox calling himself Clint Eastwood when back in the Wild West (I've always wondered how Clint reacted when that sequel was released).My biggest surprise now was the issue of nostalgia. Originally, the nostalgia emphasis had its annoying aspects, such as implying that (via time travel), Fox's fictional performance in November 1955 of ""Johnny B. Goode"" inspired Berry to find a new musical style, when in fact Berry had already had a huge hit with ""Maybellene"" several months earlier in real life. But seeing ""Back to the Future"" in 2024 it becomes obvious that the nostalgia value NOW of Fox on his skateboard, and his styling in 1985 is just as nostalgic, giving the movie a double-whammy of familiarity currently, based on its two eras depicted. I had seen the previous Gale/Zemeckis movies, all heavily nostalgic, before: ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"", ""Used Cars"" and ""1941"", and I was not a fan of their work. (One wonders what happened to Gale after they split up - his future credits after the ""Future"" trilogy are trivial, including a couple more writing gigs with Zemeckis.)",Time Travel

Fox's performance), but found it contrived and hokey overall - too much nostalgia and cutesy scenes playing down to the audience. Boy, was I wrong.I hadn't watch it again for nearly 40 years, but caught it just now on TV (with commercial breaks, yet) and can now admire the Bob Gale/Robert Zemeckis screenplay that makes the central time travel premise fun and ingeniously sets up so much clarity to seeming ""coincidences"". Even the in-jokes like Calvin Klein lead to further humor in sequels, like Fox calling himself Clint Eastwood when back in the Wild West (I've always wondered how Clint reacted when that sequel was released).My biggest surprise now was the issue of nostalgia. Originally, the nostalgia emphasis had its annoying aspects, such as implying that (via time travel), Fox's fictional performance in November 1955 of ""Johnny B. Goode"" inspired Berry to find a new musical style, when in fact Berry had already had a huge hit with ""Maybellene"" several months earlier in real life. But seeing ""Back to the Future"" in 2024 it becomes obvious that the nostalgia value NOW of Fox on his skateboard, and his styling in 1985 is just as nostalgic, giving the movie a double-whammy of familiarity currently, based on its two eras depicted. I had seen the previous Gale/Zemeckis movies, all heavily nostalgic, before: ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"", ""Used Cars"" and ""1941"", and I was not a fan of their work.

"Everyone has already talked about how amazing and fun this movie is and I'm going to join in. I went in this movie with very high expectations with everyone saying how amazing it was and somehow this movie exceeded my expectations. This movie is just perfect!Michael J Fox and all the other actors are incredible in this movie. Fox has such a natural dynamic with Christopher Lloyd. Their friendship seems too real at times. Lea Thompson really delivers this performance of a thirsty teenage girl, Thimas Wilson perfectly sells this hateful bully so it was so satisfying seeing Bill taken down but Cristin Glover sells the film and his performance is a huge reason into why George has an amazing character arc.And now let's talk about the script because this movie truly has one of the best and most exciting scripts and stories. Everything is set up so perfectly in the beginning with the character's backgrounds, personalities as well as the locations and important informatiom all being established so well for the 1955 section. Not a single scene is wasted. Every scene plays a role in the overall story and everything is linked together and this plot of Marty trying to get his 1955 version mom and dad to fall in love is a perfect concept given everything set up leading to a very exciting climax and a great character journey for George McFly.Speaking of the climax, it's probably the best part of the movie. Mainly because the movie does a great job by increasing tensions and leaving you wondering if Marty will even return back to 1985. I mean, the plan should have been a breeze but so many things went wrong and you're alwaus glued to the screen as you aren't sure what's going to happen and this leads to an emotionally satisfying climax where George and Lorainne finally kiss and that 80s music makes it 10 times better and a heart-racing climax where it seems as though Doc will fail to bring Marty to 1985 but he does and the ending is perfect, seeing Marty's family all so happy.This film is just so awesome and gets better everyime I rewatch it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop what you're doing immediately, turn on Netflix and watch the movie. You'll not be disappointed. A must-see for everyone!",Character Development

"Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd give their best performances in this understated sci-fi comedy about travelling in time.

The ridiculous situations cooked up by the writers work in some instances, and not in others; it is a bit uneven. Fox always had an infectious sense of humor on film, and it was a tragedy he had to retire prematurely from comedy.

"In 1985 teenager Marty McFly is a bit of an outcast and spends his evenings hanging out with eccentric professor Doc Brown and his various crazy and failed inventions. However when Doc asks Marty to meet him late one night in a mall parking lot, he learns that Doc has invented a working time travel system and inserted it into a DeLorean. Much to Doc's joy and Marty's surprise the machine works on its test run and Doc is all set to be the first man to travel in time when he is killed by the terrorist group who stole plutonium for him with the impression he was making them a bomb. Marty flees in the DeLorean but accidentally winds up back in 1955. Back there he convinces Doc to help him out and come up with a way of getting him back to the future. However the problem of no plutonium appears small when Marty changes the past and stops his parents meeting and falling in love.In its own way this is a classic film that delivers the goods in the same way as Frank Capra's films does although I can understand why for some it doesn't hold quite the same appeal. The plot seems complex as it involves time travel and such but it is deceptively simple and is a clever mix of sci-fi and romantic comedy that is as light and enjoyable as you could hope for. It never makes fun of itself but it never takes itself too seriously and by doing this it pitches it just perfectly. The narrative may be light but it is consistently engaging whether it is the time travel aspect or the relationships. It isn't perfect and it isn't the deepest of films but it is effortlessly a lot of fun and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.The cast are roundly great and are a big part of the film being as light and fun as it is. For my money this is Fox's best all-round performance and he plays the clean-cut American teenager really well bringing energy to the character. Of course Lloyd's performance dominates the film by its sheer colour and energy, making him the most memorable character of the piece. Thompson and Glover (two people who still look young twenty years later damn them) are both good in their roles and work well together and individually to make their part of the narrative match up to the (superficially) more appealing sci-fi stuff. Zemeckis directs with an eye for a memorable shot and visually his film matches the style and vitality of the narrative.Overall a very good film that is every bit as pleasing as the Frank Capra feel-good films that are held up as classics. Whether this film is a classic is as much up for debate as those films' classic status but it isn't really a debate that means a lot to me. What matters is that the film is engaging and entertaining, which it consistently is. It glides through a slick plot and I always enjoy it when I revisit it. Well worth taking a look if you are after a great piece of family fun.",Time Travel

"In 1985 teenager Marty McFly is a bit of an outcast and spends his evenings hanging out with eccentric professor Doc Brown and his various crazy and failed inventions. However when Doc asks Marty to meet him late one night in a mall parking lot, he learns that Doc has invented a working time travel system and inserted it into a DeLorean. Much to Doc's joy and Marty's surprise the machine works on its test run and Doc is all set to be the first man to travel in time when he is killed by the terrorist group who stole plutonium for him with the impression he was making them a bomb. Marty flees in the DeLorean but accidentally winds up back in 1955. Back there he convinces Doc to help him out and come up with a way of getting him back to the future. However the problem of no plutonium appears small when Marty changes the past and stops his parents meeting and falling in love.In its own way this is a classic film that delivers the goods in the same way as Frank Capra's films does although I can understand why for some it doesn't hold quite the same appeal. The plot seems complex as it involves time travel and such but it is deceptively simple and is a clever mix of sci-fi and romantic comedy that is as light and enjoyable as you could hope for. It never makes fun of itself but it never takes itself too seriously and by doing this it pitches it just perfectly. The narrative may be light but it is consistently engaging whether it is the time travel aspect or the relationships. It isn't perfect and it isn't the deepest of films but it is effortlessly a lot of fun and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.The cast are roundly great and are a big part of the film being as light and fun as it is. For my money this is Fox's best all-round performance and he plays the clean-cut American teenager really well bringing energy to the character. Of course Lloyd's performance dominates the film by its sheer colour and energy, making him the most memorable character of the piece. Thompson and Glover (two people who still look young twenty years later damn them) are both good in their roles and work well together and individually to make their part of the narrative match up to the (superficially) more appealing sci-fi stuff. Zemeckis directs with an eye for a memorable shot and visually his film matches the style and vitality of the narrative.Overall a very good film that is every bit as pleasing as the Frank Capra feel-good films that are held up as classics.

"If you are reading this, it more than likely means you still haven't seen bttf, but you are thinking about watching it. If that is the case, you need this movie in your life.I first watched this movie when I was about 8 years old, and have loved the trilogy ever since. But this, the first of the 3, is arguably the best.I would say it's suitable for the entire family, but be warned, there is one or 2 minor profanities if you are watching it on DVD/Bluray, but if you are watching it on TV, these will have been neatly removed from the movie for you ;-) It's got an awesome soundtrack, it's funny, it holds your attention and has awesome gadgets and props, the big one being the time travelling Delorean, and a timeless fun story line.Marty (Michael J Fox) goes back in time and has to find a younger Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in the past to help him get Back to the Future before he potentially changes things in his present (1985).This movie has lived on to be a timeless classic and remains one of my favourite movies of all time.Trust me, you won't be disappointed and will be itching to watch the next 2 instalments as soon as your done with this one.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"I recently celebrated October 21, 2015 by re-watching the Back to the Future trilogy. And they were amazing. I had quite honestly forgotten just how good they were, just how funny, innovative, crazy, fast and quotable. And this is the one that started it all, and is easily the best film in the whole trilogy, which is saying a lot, keeping in mind the utter amount of quality all of them have.We all know the story. Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time machine, and wants his young friend Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to act as a witness for the first trial run. But things don't go as planned - do they ever - and Marty is flung back into the past where he has to figure out how he can get, you guessed it, back to the future. Great, amazing basic story, but what really makes this one of the most iconic time travel films ever made is the amount of detail they put into the world and the characters. The very first scene, for example, of Marty stepping into Doc's house looking for him is filled with vast amounts of little touches that all tell a story, both about Doc and Marty.And the movie just keeps going. All of the characters are very memorable and just the right amount of over the top and exaggerated. From Marty's ultimate wimp of a father George (Crispin Glover) to Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), who's such a massive Hollywood bully that it's a wonder he hasn't spontaneously combusted from sheer stereotypicality. But all that's part of the fun and the characters are played so well and the movie is so light in tone that their over the topness actually works for the film's advantage.The score by Alan Silvestri is also fantastic, one of the most iconic movie soundtracks in cinema history. Whenever the main theme blasts from the screen you're flung straight into an adventure. The special effects are also surprisingly decent. Sure there are some obvious computer effects, but they were very good for their time and luckily the film relies mostly on practical effects.Saying anything more would frankly spoil the movie too much. But trust me when I say that this is one of the finest adventure films ever made. It's cinema enjoyment distilled into its purest form. It's a sin I hadn't seen it in such a long time. A mistake which shall not be made again.",Back To The Future Trilogy

I had quite honestly forgotten just how good they were, just how funny, innovative, crazy, fast and quotable. And this is the one that started it all, and is easily the best film in the whole trilogy, which is saying a lot, keeping in mind the utter amount of quality all of them have.We all know the story. Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time machine, and wants his young friend Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to act as a witness for the first trial run. But things don't go as planned - do they ever - and Marty is flung back into the past where he has to figure out how he can get, you guessed it, back to the future. Great, amazing basic story, but what really makes this one of the most iconic time travel films ever made is the amount of detail they put into the world and the characters. The very first scene, for example, of Marty stepping into Doc's house looking for him is filled with vast amounts of little touches that all tell a story, both about Doc and Marty.And the movie just keeps going. All of the characters are very memorable and just the right amount of over the top and exaggerated. From Marty's ultimate wimp of a father George (Crispin Glover) to Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), who's such a massive Hollywood bully that it's a wonder he hasn't spontaneously combusted from sheer stereotypicality. But all that's part of the fun and the characters are played so well and the movie is so light in tone that their over the topness actually works for the film's advantage.The score by Alan Silvestri is also fantastic, one of the most iconic movie soundtracks in cinema history. Whenever the main theme blasts from the screen you're flung straight into an adventure. The special effects are also surprisingly decent. Sure there are some obvious computer effects, but they were very good for their time and luckily the film relies mostly on practical effects.Saying anything more would frankly spoil the movie too much. But trust me when I say that this is one of the finest adventure films ever made. It's cinema enjoyment distilled into its purest form. It's a sin I hadn't seen it in such a long time. A mistake which shall not be made again.",Visual Effects

"Generation spanning movie. Kids, teens, adults, olders all love it. It has no wasted scenes, no bad dialog really, and no reliance on special effects.I can't really think of another movie so perfect for what it was. End Game maybe as the pinnacle super hero movie to end the MCU reign maybe.Part 2 suffered from no Crispin Glover. He really had the great tones and mannerisms for a foil for Marty.Everyone knows at least some lines from this movie. Everyone literally. A true gem.I see local Deloreans set up to look like the car from this movie. It draws more visitors than a typical lambo. I just added the last paragraph, true as it is, to meet the character requirements of the review.",Cultural Impact
"The movie starts out with a cool premise and slowly starts to explore that premise and everything is more-or-less fine until about half way through the movie, but that's where the movie starts to fall apart. Things like unrealistic decisions by the characters are plentiful all throughout the movie, which spoils the immersion quite a bit. The acting also isn't great and several scenes had me cringing at the voice lines. The implementation of time-travel and the 'butterfly effect' that the time-travel has which is shown in the movie is also flawed and unrealistic, though they undoubtedly chose this flawed version of time-travel in order to create some false drama and suspense, so I guess it can be somewhat excused. The movie also has little-to-no humor or comedy in it... I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire movie, and it's not like comedy movies from the 1980's can't make me laugh, in-fact, I laughed several times at 'Good morning Vietnam' and 'Airplane!' and 'Police Academy' and 'Ghostbusters', so it's really just that 'Back to the Future' has no discernible comedy in it to be honest.So overall, it's a pretty sub-par Adventure film which lacks both comedy and realism, but is watchable if you've never watched it before. Avoid rewatching it though as it's simply not worth your time.",Time Travel

"*Back to the Future* is more than just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that captures the essence of imagination and adventure in a way that transcends generations. Released in 1985 and directed by the iconic Robert Zemeckis, this sci-fi classic invites viewers to take a whirlwind ride through time, expertly blending humor, heart, and a sprinkle of science fiction.The film follows the antics of Marty McFly, played with a perfect blend of charm and awkwardness by Michael J. Fox, who finds himself accidentally transported to the past via a DeLorean time machine invented by the eccentric yet endearing Doc Brown, portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd. The premise is deceptively simple-Marty must ensure that his parents fall in love to secure his own existence-yet it unfolds into a labyrinth of hilarious complications, clever twists, and thought-provoking reflections on choices and consequences.One of the film's greatest triumphs is its ability to resonate emotionally, as Marty wrestles not only with the bizarre realities of 1955 but also with his own insecurities and the weight of legacy. The interactions between his teenage parents are both comedic and touching, showcasing how changes in the past can dramatically alter the future in ways both humorous and profound.*Back to the Future* is a tour de force, seamlessly merging practical effects with imaginative storytelling. The iconic DeLorean, with its signature ""flux capacitor,"" has become an emblem of adventure and possibility. The film's meticulous attention to detail in recreating the 1950s-from the music to the fashion-immerses viewers in a nostalgic trip that feels both authentic and fantastical.The clever screenplay, packed with quotable lines and memorable moments, pairs brilliantly with Alan Silvestri's unforgettable score, which echoes the film's themes of adventure and hope.

Fox, who finds himself accidentally transported to the past via a DeLorean time machine invented by the eccentric yet endearing Doc Brown, portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd. The premise is deceptively simple-Marty must ensure that his parents fall in love to secure his own existence-yet it unfolds into a labyrinth of hilarious complications, clever twists, and thought-provoking reflections on choices and consequences.One of the film's greatest triumphs is its ability to resonate emotionally, as Marty wrestles not only with the bizarre realities of 1955 but also with his own insecurities and the weight of legacy. The interactions between his teenage parents are both comedic and touching, showcasing how changes in the past can dramatically alter the future in ways both humorous and profound.*Back to the Future* is a tour de force, seamlessly merging practical effects with imaginative storytelling. The iconic DeLorean, with its signature ""flux capacitor,"" has become an emblem of adventure and possibility. The film's meticulous attention to detail in recreating the 1950s-from the music to the fashion-immerses viewers in a nostalgic trip that feels both authentic and fantastical.The clever screenplay, packed with quotable lines and memorable moments, pairs brilliantly with Alan Silvestri's unforgettable score, which echoes the film's themes of adventure and hope. From the exhilarating ride through the time barrier to the heartwarming finale, every scene serves to remind us that while we can't change the past, we hold the power to shape our future.*Back to the Future* is a timeless masterpiece that deserves its place in the pantheon of cinematic greats. It's a film that celebrates innovation, friendship, and the joys of growing up-encouraging us all to embrace our past while looking forward with optimism.

"Even though I'm still convinced that the eighties are one of the worst decades in recent history when it comes to movies and music and even though I never liked Sci-Fi movies, there is one big exception to that rule. In my opinion ""Back to the Future"" is not only one of the best movies in the genre, it's also in my list of all time favorite movies. When I saw it for the first time, I remember to be blown away by it. But than again, I was only 10 years old, not exactly an age on which you've already seen many really good movies to which you can compare another one. But even now, 20 years after its first release and after I've seen hundreds of movies, I still like it a lot.It's 1985 and Marty McFly is a typical teenager who doesn't like his parents and who has some problems at school. His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of all kinds of (useless) machines. But this time he has invented something that is much more interesting. He has created a plutonium-powered time machine based on a DeLorean. But when something goes wrong, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955, the time in which his parents still were young. Not only has he got to adapt to this entirely new environment, he also has to make sure that nothing is changed, because that might have serious consequences for the future...I guess the best reason why this movie works so well and feels so timeless is because they don't use the time machine to go forward. Instead of showing us the future, which wouldn't look exactly like it is right now, they have chosen to go back 30 years, a time period which they new very well and could recreate perfectly. If they hadn't done this, the movie would have felt dated one day and no-one would have liked it because it was far from possible. Another good thing about this movie is the acting. Take for instance Michael J. Fox. Not everything that he has done in his career was very successful, but in this movie he shines. I truly believe that this is one of his best performances ever. The same for Christopher Lloyd. Even though his Dr. Emmett Brown looks like if he could have come out of a cartoon, his acting gives the character something likable and makes you forget about that 'problem'.Overall I really liked this movie a lot. It's one of the finest examples in Sci-Fi movies and I can keep watching it time after time. That's why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than 8/10.",Time Travel

"When it comes to not only incredible storytelling yet a truly great example of what a film should be, this and the entire trilogy define an undeniably 'timeless' experience that are forever lasting. Few times does a story introduce characters the way in which this does while at the same time delicately setting up what will become larger plot points. At every turn, there's another little surprise that lures the viewer in more and more. I think what's most profound here as opposed to other films similar to the genre is that although it's about time travel, it's moreover about people and relationships over anything else. Somehow, the writers prevent the story from getting bogged down in technical jargon and instead have smartly allowed the story of these characters to be present above all else. In summation, constantly entertaining and forever remarkable.",Time Travel

"If you're looking for a movie that you can watch over and over and not get tired of it, this is it. Teenager Marty McFly comes from a weird family. His dad, George McFly, is a huge nerd who is always getting pushed around by his boss Biff Tannon. His mom is a controlling, hypocritical, burned out alcoholic. His brother is an air head that works at Burger King and his sister is doomed to the same fate as her mother so it seems. But Marty finds release in his lovely girlfriend Jennifer and his wacky scientist friend Dr. Emmit L. Brown. Marty dreams of making the big time with his band but is held back by the criticism of others, his fear of rejection, and the short comings of his family. But one day Doc Brown calls upon Marty to assist him in the testing of his newest invention, a DeLorean converted into a time machine.

Christopher Lloyd is becoming one of my favorite actors as I continue my journey throught IMDBs 250 list. This film is probably one of my favorites with storyline and has some pretty epic special effects.,Visual Effects
Just watching this got me hooked in! It was very good from the start to the finish. Once i watched the rest i wanted them to release even more of the film like maybe a forth and fifth trilogy. I think that the best has to be so far episode 3 because it is the most exciting with all of the time travel. I could watch it over and over again. I would definitely watch this as it is an amazing film and that there is even more to come in the next episodes of back to the future and that is why i rate it a ten. If you are into an action packed film and want to get up with the family then this is a perfect film to watch. I have been very engaged with it.,Time Travel

"There are certain films that you grow up with. You see them on TV all the time and feel compelled to watch. I have seen Back To The Future more times than i care to imagine. Each and every time i watch it, it never fails to get me hooked straightaway. What is it about this film that makes it endlessly watchable? The main character is a kid i wanted to be. I even tried to copy his famous skateboard trick on a number of occasions- each time managing to hurt my shin in the process. The film centres around Marty Mcfly played by Michael J. Fox. He is accidentally transported back in time to the year 1955 where he inadvertently prevents his parents from falling in love-hence threatening his very existence. It may sound complicated but the genius of the film is the simplicity of the script. In short, Marty just wants to get back home. To assist him in his quest is the man who helped him get there in the first place (you still with me? good). Doc Brown is as eccentric as they come but Christopher Lloyd makes him lovable with his great performance. The chemistry between Michael J. Fox and the afore mentioned Lloyd is the key to the entire movie. It works a treat, making the film come to life. Watching Marty and Doc struggle to put their well thought out plan into action at the film's climax is as exciting as anything seen. The scale of this movie is not huge. It's not a big special effects film. Yes it does involve time travel and yes it's a big adventure. However, it's the characters-not a big budget- that make this film special. The score makes the film jump out of the screen.. The Back To The Future main theme is one of the most recognised in cinema. Only very special films tap into popular culture and this movie sits proudly alongside the Star Wars' and Indiana Jones'of this world.. The phrase 'Back to The Future' will be with us forever- just as this classic movie will be. 'Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads'",Back To The Future Trilogy

"Back to the Future is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. I never grow tired of this film, I know the story inside and out now and I still happily watch it every time, laughing at the same parts, watching at the edge of my seat with others, it never gets old for me, it's a pure eighties classic, and one of the few movies that all generations tend to enjoy. The cast is fantastic and one of the most vital parts of making this movie work, they didn't seem like easy characters, particularly Marty and Doc, they have a lot of layers and certain requirements for portraying them accurately, but every actor nails their role, the script has some very funny bits, but also dramatic parts, and the cast succeeds in all areas of acting. The story is quite complicated, it has the concept of time travel involved, thrown in with a complicated love story, as well as a lot of necessary character development, but it manages to perfectly bring all of this together in a movie that isn't even two hours long, and it dosen't manage to feel any bit cluttered or overlong. Memorable lines, historical movie moments, outstanding performances, a beautiful script and stellar directing from the great Robert Zemeckis, I consider Back to the Future to be my favourite movie, I think all moviegoers should see it, it's a must watch. After ending up in the year 1955 through his friend Doctor Emmet Brown's time machine, Marty McFly must make sure his parents get together to ensure his existence after ruining the moment they fell in love.

In this case, however, I do not find logic. Not that the film is bad. It's funny, it's watchable, and the main characters are colorful and memorable. Somehow, though, it didn't grab me all that much. I didn't find it super funny, adventurous or surprising enough. In short, nothing new under sky. Well, yeah, but that's not how most people feel.Weird.Well, at the end of the day, the important thing is that when we take the time to do something, we enjoy it as much as possible, and I'm glad that Back to the Future (1985) achieved that multiple times.

"First, sorry for my spelling; I usually speak french! :P When Marty goes back in 1885 in back to the future part 3, he damaged the gasoline tank. They had to push the car with a train because they were out of gas. But there was another solution! There were 2 dolorean in 1885. The first one was the dolorean that Marty find in 1955 at the beginning of the movie and that he push with the train to go back in 1985 at the end of the movie. The second one was the dolorean that Doc have hided a few days ago near the cemetery (The car that Marty find at the beginning of the movie).

"It's a teenage movie, it's a comedy, it's a science fiction adventure... and there's nothing better.Back to the Future is a smart inventive all-time masterpiece and I have never known any other movie that I have seen that I have watched over and over again and again, that's how much I love this movie. The cast and their chemistry on screen are unforgettable: Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is an energetic teenager with a passion for music and someone who does not want you to call ""chicken"".Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown is a scientist who wants to invent something unique that works and to change the world. With his new invention of time travel that he made out of a DeLorean. Christopher Lloyd's performance was not nominated for an Oscar because his performance was the most fascinating part of the movie and one of the most interesting performances in a movie that I've seen in a long while. More praise goes to Chrispin Glover's performance as George McFly. He was my favourite part of the movie, especially the two scenes where he tries to woo Lorraine Baines and says ""I'm your density"" one of my favourite movie quotes. The moment in the film (SPOILERS just in case you haven't seen it yet) where he stands up to Biff surprised me and showed me that he could stand up for himself and the woman he loves. Lea Thompson was fantastic as well as Lorraine Baines.Back to the Future was something that surprised me because I never knew now how much I would love it. I don't know if I've ever felt this good about a movie in a long time since I first watched Jaws or Whiplash.10/10",Comedy Elements

"One of the most iconic movies in cinematic history, where, in 1985, young Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels back to 1955 in a time machine (named the DeLorean) invented by his scientist friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). In meets his high-school-age parents and inadvertently disrupts their first meeting; therefore, he must unite them in order to save their eventual courtship and marriage, and ultimately, Marty's own existence.Despite being an '80s film, the special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean.The direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film engaging throughout, from Marty traveling back in time to save Emmett Brown to him meeting his future family. Seeing the transformation from the characters in present time to the past with Marty trying to patch things up in the past for a better future outcome are things that make time travel films brilliant. I also especially liked the dialog from the 1955 time-line, ""He's teasing you, nobody has two television sets!"" Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson. They all made the film fun and entertaining. As a time travel film, this plot really has a race against time element that makes this movie that much more exciting and an edge-of-your-seat experience. A must-see for sci-fi fans!

"Few things are as difficult to accomplish as a movie dealing with time-traveling. To take on themes as risky as paradoxes and time loops you primarily need a healthy dose of courage and ambition, but most importantly loads of writing talent and cinematic vision. The scenario of ""Back to the Future"", courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and co-producer Bob Gale, is honestly one of the most brilliant ones ever penned down and, thanks to the financial support of several acclaimed producers (including Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall), it also became one of the most massively entertaining films of all time, with sublime special & sound effects, diversity of genres and some of the greatest casting choices and acting performances ever. ""Back to the Future"" is quintessentially speaking a Sci-Fi comedy, but Robert Zemeckis admirably also hints at the more emotional and melodramatic aspects regarding time traveling. Also, even though the film boosts some of the greatest effects ever, their use merely remains functional and occasionally, so that the emphasis continuously lies on the story and the development of the characters instead of on flamboyant machinery and overlong speeches about scientific theories. The DeLorean is a stylish and original piece of scenery, but other than the fantastic and already legendary vehicle there are no giant laboratories with thousands of flickering lights. Marty McFly is a typical mid-80's teenager with a skateboard he knows how to use and a delightful high school sweetheart that loves him very much. His parents George and Lorraine, however, are a pitiable and hopelessly old-fashioned couple and thus he spends most of his free time with his genius but slightly eccentric friend Doc Brown. The latter invented a time-traveling device and, following a series of bizarre events, Marty accidentally travels back to 1955; the year his parents met and fell in love during the school prom. Marty has only one chance to return to the future, but in the meantime he has to correct the events he tampered with in order to save the future and even assure his own birth. The script is very well constructed and literally stuffed with witty little details that refer to earlier events and/or events that have yet to appear, either later in the film or even in one of the sequels. The humor works, the light-headed tone and atmosphere puts a big smile on your face, you come to care for the characters and the awesome soundtrack even makes it difficult to remain in your seat. Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson all give away excellent performances, but my two preferred roles are for Christopher Lloyd (with his confused looks and bizarre facial expressions, he makes a superb mad scientist) and Crispin Glover. The latter appears to be born to depict weirdos and uncanny freaks, so the role of introvert and mysterious George McFly fits him perfectly.",Time Travel

The latter invented a time-traveling device and, following a series of bizarre events, Marty accidentally travels back to 1955; the year his parents met and fell in love during the school prom. Marty has only one chance to return to the future, but in the meantime he has to correct the events he tampered with in order to save the future and even assure his own birth. The script is very well constructed and literally stuffed with witty little details that refer to earlier events and/or events that have yet to appear, either later in the film or even in one of the sequels. The humor works, the light-headed tone and atmosphere puts a big smile on your face, you come to care for the characters and the awesome soundtrack even makes it difficult to remain in your seat. Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson all give away excellent performances, but my two preferred roles are for Christopher Lloyd (with his confused looks and bizarre facial expressions, he makes a superb mad scientist) and Crispin Glover. The latter appears to be born to depict weirdos and uncanny freaks, so the role of introvert and mysterious George McFly fits him perfectly.",Soundtrack Quality
"Honestly, I could watch this into my grave. I saw this first when I was about 10 years-old and fell in love with it ever since. My first boyfriend asked me out by showing me this movie. Basically what I'm trying to say, is that this movie is fantastic. Back to the Future has elements for everyone, and is great for watching with the family or relaxing by yourself. The DeLorean has become such an icon, and it's no wonder! The film sets up great jokes and entertainment throughout the entire story, and fantastic one-liners. ""Great Scott!"" ""Man this is heavy"" and my personal favorite ""Why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?"" are some of the best in movie history. This 80s classic never fails to disappoint, and is always going to be my number one movie.",Back To The Future Trilogy

"It has everything. Adventure, excitement, romance, sci-fi and comedy. It's almost flawless in design; Robert Zemekis and Bob Gale worked hard on the tight continuity in the Back To the Future trilogy. Making sure there weren't any goofs in the plot. They researched almost everything scientifically, except the correct pronounciation of gigawatt ;) This is a great family movie. And my favorite of all time",Science Fiction

Fox is one of the best things in the movie because he portrays with a hunger for curosity.  Back to the Future(1985) is the best and most famous film in the career of Michael J. Fox.  Christopher Lloyd is wacky as the eccentric scientist, Dr. Brown. There is a scene in this movie that is inspired by Terry Gilliam's Brazil(1985).  Lea Thompson is just sweet natured and shy as Marty McFly's future mother, Lorraine Baines.

"I recently watched a movie with a simple linear story in the time travel genre that I found really enjoyable. The movie revolves around a teenage boy named Marty who helps a scientist named Doc Brown test his time machine. However, Marty ends up traveling back in time and has to find his way back to the present.The movie's plot, while simple, still holds up and can be quite enjoyable. However, I felt that compared to more recent time-travel movies with complex and interesting storylines, this one may seem a bit basic. The plot revolves around a teen helping another teen get his dream girl and stand up to his bully but with time travel involved. This plot didn't work for me. But I didn't regret watching it.The acting in the movie was generally good, although I felt that the actors who played George and Lorraine overacted in their scenes. The cinematography was impressive for its time, and the music added to the overall enjoyment of the film. The pacing of the movie was just right, not too fast or slow.Overall, I found the movie fun to watch, but I was hoping for a more complex or thrilling storyline, rather than the teen drama that it turned out to be. I'd rate this movie a 7 because of its simple plot, but otherwise, it's a good watch.",Plot Complexity

"The best and most influential film was. I just love every scene and my favorite actor is Michael J. Fox. The second part was very good too and I loved the laces coming long ago, yet it is mainly small but still enjoy the movie when I hear or see a good bit of Power Of Love Music. However, the third part. Infolog should then was good but unfortunately he became weak and boring in my opinion. If you do not want to have to get more money out of scratch it then do not go straight for one year it was sold out of the third one. But even which well animated movie beats. What is the worth of a good animation is a good CGI is an action movie when the story was rich does not tie up the man. So Back to the future : 10/10 Back to the future part 2 : 10/9 Back to the future part 3 : 10/7",Soundtrack Quality

"An outstanding sci-fi adventure - one of the coolest movies ever produced. Yes it's great to watch if you enjoy good comedy, science fiction and are interested in the concept of time travel.I was 13 years old in 1985 and, like most kids who watched this film, I wanted a really super cool time traveling delorean just like Doc and Marty. The idea of time travel will get you thinking and wishing you could go back in time. It seems like a lot of fun but the paradoxes that time travel could create might be a bit bizarre just as Doc (Lloyd) and Marty (Fox) found out.This sci-fi is a wonderful classic and is still great by today's film standards.10/10",Science Fiction
"Even 31 years after its initial release, Back to the Future has stood the test of time! There is absolutely no possible way ANYONE could hate this movie, and there are 3 reasons why!The first reason why Back to the Future is an impossible movie to hate is that its story is very original and doesn't seem to be hard for anyone to understand! A small-town California teen named Marty McFly is thrown back into the '50s when an experiment by his eccentric scientist friend Doc Brown goes awry. Traveling through time in a modified DeLorean car, Marty encounters young versions of his parents, and must make sure that they fall in love or he'll cease to exist. Even more dauntingly, Marty has to return to his own time and save the life of Doc Brown. One of the greatest aspects of the story is the idea of a teenager and a scientist traveling back in time in a DeLorean, which I have to imagine is the only instance of a movie making heavy use of a car as a way to travel through time. Another great aspect of the story is its message which argues that you can travel back in time to the years when your parents were teenagers, and straighten them out right at the moment when they needed help the most.The second reason why Back to the Future is an impossible movie to hate is the amount of memorable scenes and quotes that anyone who has seen the movie knows the most about! One of the most memorable scenes is when Doc tests out his time machine while Marty uses a video camera to record it. Doc tells Marty that if his calculations are correct, ""when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***!"" The final reason why Back to the Future is impossible to hate is the amazing design that delves into the 1950's era with a flourish and takes you to the unknown future with creative flare. Robert Zemeckis sure did a great job at directing every single aspect of the movie, but he was more efficient in directing the visual style of the film was that allowed audiences to experience the culture and nostalgia of the 1950s in a humorous way!",Cinematic Techniques

"Time travel and the possibilities it offered, of altering the past, knowing the future, meeting people/beings from the future, has always fascinated people. Renowned authors from H.G Wells and Isaac Asimov to Charles Dickens have given their interpretation of time-travel. Hollywood too brought out movies like Terminator and the Star Trek franchise. They had all used it on a grand scale, to explore things like ethics and/or future societies. Nobody thought of placing it in a simple high-school setting and using it to comic effect until Back to the Future came along.A teenager, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally transported to 1955 (which is 30 years ago since the present day for this movie is 1985). There he interferes with the moment his high-school-age parents meet, to fall in love later, thereby endangering his own existence. To prevent that from happening, Marty has to play match-maker to his parents. What we have is a very entertaining comedy full of enjoyable characters like the eccentric scientist, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), the school bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) and his sidekicks, Marty's parents, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover) and the school principal Strickland (James Tolkan). It also manages to have a few tense moments towards the end. It's funny, it's intelligent, and it expands the scope of time-travel by focusing on smaller events.",Cultural Impact

The simplistic universe that proposes a priori annoying to take the movie as a serious thing but plays a lot in their favor to take it as a simple metacomedia of the time in retrospect.
BUT there are also good things, the script of the film is a masterpiece that nowadays is studied because it is so round. Its importance lies in giving coherence to science fiction that until then was left in second place.
The characters despite not being super complex are charismatic and work wonders even if they are medium interpretations.

For anyone with a mind remotely based in science or logic nearly everything comes off too stupid or illogical to enjoy this movie. Marty McFly makes a terrible decision in nearly every situation and seems to keep forgetting that he traveled back In time.

-Marty's family photo (from the ""future"") starts to fade based on his actions. This makes ZERO sense; if you altered your future and negated your existence, you wouldn't exist and the photo wouldn't exist. If they wanted to try and make scientific sense it would have been more like Schr��dinger's Cat where Marty disappears intermittently and the photo changes.-After traveling back in time Marty seems to never remember he came from the future and makes every silly blunder possible to create issues for himself. He makes no attempt to blend in when it matters most, and in every situation he seems just as confused and flabbergasted that he's in the last, even though it's very clear he knows he is.

"Lots of tongue in cheek. Some great characterization. A chance at redemption. These movies showed Michael J. Fox to be a wonderful comedic presence. It is sad what happened to him, but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in ""The Good Wife"" as the slimy, underhanded character lawyer he plays, I love that I can ""not like"" a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie, Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father, a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then, of course, there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel, there is a kind of suspense that works very well. It's pure fun and is the best of the three films in my opinion.",Science Fiction

"A scientist invents a time machine that accidentally sends his young friend back to 1955.This is a classic adventure-comedy with great characters, sci-fi concepts and storytelling. Certain elements require a suspension of disbelief, however it's so enjoyable you get swept along with it.The plot is simple but superbly detailed in how it takes a number of characters through individual arcs and focuses on period details, particularly in emphasising the fish out of water angle of Marty McFly as an 80s kid trapped in his parents era. Practically everything that happens links to something else that occurs at a later point in the story. Whilst doing all of the above it takes us on a highly enjoyable and thrilling adventure.One of its biggest strengths is a sharp script that provides great comedy, lots of cultural references and quotable lines from many characters such as Marty, Doc, George, Lorraine and Biff.This is a movie with a number of memorable scenes such as at Twin Pines Mall, the Enchantment Under The Sea dance and the lightening bolt at the clock tower. In fact, the movie creates an almost living and breathing character out of the fictional town of Hill Valley as we have great scenes in numerous locations such as Lou's Diner, Lyon Estates and Courthouse in different eras.The visuals are brilliant with great cinematography, period detail, costumes and visual effects.

"A scientist invents a time machine that accidentally sends his young friend back to 1955.This is a classic adventure-comedy with great characters, sci-fi concepts and storytelling. Certain elements require a suspension of disbelief, however it's so enjoyable you get swept along with it.The plot is simple but superbly detailed in how it takes a number of characters through individual arcs and focuses on period details, particularly in emphasising the fish out of water angle of Marty McFly as an 80s kid trapped in his parents era. Practically everything that happens links to something else that occurs at a later point in the story. Whilst doing all of the above it takes us on a highly enjoyable and thrilling adventure.One of its biggest strengths is a sharp script that provides great comedy, lots of cultural references and quotable lines from many characters such as Marty, Doc, George, Lorraine and Biff.This is a movie with a number of memorable scenes such as at Twin Pines Mall, the Enchantment Under The Sea dance and the lightening bolt at the clock tower. In fact, the movie creates an almost living and breathing character out of the fictional town of Hill Valley as we have great scenes in numerous locations such as Lou's Diner, Lyon Estates and Courthouse in different eras.The visuals are brilliant with great cinematography, period detail, costumes and visual effects.

"This is a good movie about a boy who accidentally travels back in time and gives us a crazy story. This movie is rich in content, and we got to know a lot of different characters. I think the story was quite alright, and I appreciate when stories include time as a topic, which I think was well used in this one. Time travel is always interesting, and it rarely disappoints me. The story was kind of simple, but I think it was the interaction between the characters that made up for most of it. I think the actors were mostly good, but my attention goes to Crispin Glover (as George McFly). He played such a unique character, and his performance was great! This movie is definitely recommending!",Character Relationships

"This may not be the best movie of the eighties. But it is the movie that I deem to best represent the cinema and spirit of the decade. If you're wondering, that movie for the fifties is Rebel Without a Cause. For the sixties, it's Planet of the Apes. For the seventies, it's Apocalypse Now. For the nineties, it's the Truman Show. For the 2000s, it's The Dark Knight. For the 2010s, it's... I don't know. The Social Network? Anyways; let's dive in to this film, possibly my favorite true action-comedy of all time. If I want to be entertained for two hours, this is the film I'll pop in. There are two kinds of excellence in film; the kind that appeals to what 'normal people' want in movies and the kind that appeals to those who deal probably deal far too much in the esoteric. While I firmly belong in the second group, I am a film-goer, and as such, I do enjoy the first kind. And no film offers more of the first kind than this one.The comedy, the action, the tone, the stylings; they're all here. It does not try to be a big, emotional artsy movie. Instead, it just takes you for an enjoyable ride. The eighties did this kind of movie better than any decade. When you think of eighties movies, you likely think of these movies. This is the best one, but the likes of The Goonies, Ghostbusters, Gremlins, and likely any other movie in this decade with the involvement of Steven Spielberg comes to mind.Not to say that the eighties didn't try to make serious movies too. they just weren't very good at it. If you're interested, look up a list of Best Picture winners. Watching them is a bit weird; they have some eighties stylings but are dead grim and often depressing. It's like watching a film from a different dimension. Some were fine (Terms of Endearment) some were not as good (Out of Africa).I like the lot of them as a whole better than most. And the ones that people really like (Amadeus, Platoon, etc) that people love, I likely love more. But I will admit that they aren't exactly foremost on most people's eyes. There's a reason that there aren't talks to remake Driving Miss Daisy. And it's not because it's artistic blasphemy. They would remake The Godfather if they thought that it would make them money.Here's a novel idea: how about I actually discuss Back to the Future? A high school kid named Marty McFly, down in the dumps from his high school life, where he is bullied by Biff Tannen and is under the control of the aptly named Principal Strickland (strangely, growing up, I had an insurance agent with that last name around by neighborhood. It was weird.) His home life isn't much better: his dad is a wimp, his mom is prudish enough to make one shrivel up, and his siblings are layabouts. But his life changes once his friend Doc Brown makes a time machine (2015 here. still waiting for one). As he stole plutonium form Libyan militants, they chase and kill him. While escaping in a DeLorean, Marty transports them back to 1955.Thus begins the best use of nostalgia for the fifties in an eighties movie I've ever seen. Their cleverness in weaving in it is matched only by what they do with their setting. Where as a lesser movie would just throw up scenery and call it a day, this film uses every opportunity to use its setting for purposes both comedic and dramatic.Whereas films like Dirty Dancing couldn't even immerse their film completely in one decade (if you're gonna be a fifties movie, don't use an eighties soundtrack), this movie somehow manages to immerse you in two decades. Their version of the fifties is solid and fully fleshed out. It does not use pandering or too many rosey tones but still manages to capture the sensation of time traveling there.All this is only likely noticed on a third viewing. The first time, you are too immersed in the perfect blend of action and comedy, a trademark of Zemeckis at his best, from Forrest Gump to Who Framed (not Killed, no matter what my brain thinks) Roger Rabbit, as well as in the tight writing. The second time, you are two invested in the characters and one of the best and catchiest soundtracks of the decade. But if you watch this movie as much as I do, you notice that it is there.What else is there to say? there is a reason that I have such a personal attachment to this film. The only bad thing is that we don't have a time machine that would allow this film to be watched an infinite amount of times without any real time passing. But maybe someday. After all, where we're going, we don't need roads.",Cinematic Techniques

"I was definitely late to the party on this one. I missed out on watching this at anytime over the past 26 years of my life, and I also missed watching it during the anniversary event in October 2015. I believe the adage is ""better late than never"", I hope it is anyway. No matter how late I was to this film, I'm glad I watched it. Back to the Future was a wonderful tale of ingenuity, diligence, and retribution. Michael J. Fox teams up with Christopher Lloyd in a quest finish his greatest invention and freely travel the realms of time.Our story begins in 1985, as we are introduced to Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a quintessential American teenager, forever embarrassed of his parents and seeking independence. His friendship with the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is well- established as he is in tuned to the many experiments he is in the process of developing. When Doc is ready to unveil his creation, he asks Marty to meet him at the mall in the middle of the night. Shocked at Doc's explanation that he has uncovered the secret ingredient needed to power his time machine, Marty is intrigued. When a terrible accident takes place, Marty is accidentally send to November 12th, 1955 where his entire existence hangs in the balance, as he must be sure that his parents to-be meet and fall in love, in spite of the fact that his entry into the past has disrupted this. The audience accompanies Marty through a nostalgic look at life in the 50's, and all that Marty introduces to the past. Marty's trip culminates with a big finale that must spark him back to his present.No one talks about Back to the Future without mentioning the incredible on-screen chemistry between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Despite their vast differences in age, they pull off a believable well-established friendship beautifully on-screen. Several scenes throughout involve just the two of them, a type of movie in which chemistry is crucial. Another bright spot of the film is the shooting. With many special effects, especially in the climax, it needs to be believable or the story would fall apart. Robert Zemeckis obviously directs a beauty with Back to the Future and is a joy for audiences from beginning to end.A powerful message emerges as one watches Back to the Future. Many of the film's leads at one point has their character questioned. At the beginning of the film we meet George McFly (Crispin Glover), who doesn't look like he's strayed far from the 1950's even in the 80's. He is getting pushed around in the film, like he has all of his life, and seems to be destined for a life filled with this type of abuse. He seems to have no respect from his family members, or anyone else that comes into contact with him. Marty shows us, through his journey that sometime all it takes to make someone realize they deserve better is a little confidence from a friend. We also learn early on in the film that Marty has a passion for music and a dream to pursue it. He gets a big chance to realize this musical dream at his parent's dance in the past. He convinces his dad to pursue his own writing dream when he visits him in 1955, and seeing his father's dream pan out, one can only assume Marty will take his own advice in the future. One can also take a lesson from Doc Brown's perseverance throughout the film. He is never appreciated for his ingenuity, and often thought of as crazy for pursuing his scientific endeavors. In spite of all this criticism, Doc presses on and remains steadfast in his scientific exploits. There is something in this film for everyone, and the audience is given enough tools to find whatever suits them.Now that I have finally seen Back to the Future, I can understand why it has remained such a staple for decades after its release. This story provides a feel good story of normal, good people overcoming the evils of other normal people. Not an overwhelming moral story to the point where it is cheesy and unbelievable, but one that tugs at this reviewer's heartstrings nonetheless. Back to the Future is a four star prize for me, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes to follow an engaging story with fun characters. One does not even have to be a fan of time travel movies, as I am not, to enjoy this film. I'm glad I finally gave this movie a chance, and I will probably be along for the whole series.",Science Fiction

When Doc is ready to unveil his creation, he asks Marty to meet him at the mall in the middle of the night. Shocked at Doc's explanation that he has uncovered the secret ingredient needed to power his time machine, Marty is intrigued. When a terrible accident takes place, Marty is accidentally send to November 12th, 1955 where his entire existence hangs in the balance, as he must be sure that his parents to-be meet and fall in love, in spite of the fact that his entry into the past has disrupted this. The audience accompanies Marty through a nostalgic look at life in the 50's, and all that Marty introduces to the past. Marty's trip culminates with a big finale that must spark him back to his present.No one talks about Back to the Future without mentioning the incredible on-screen chemistry between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Despite their vast differences in age, they pull off a believable well-established friendship beautifully on-screen. Several scenes throughout involve just the two of them, a type of movie in which chemistry is crucial. Another bright spot of the film is the shooting. With many special effects, especially in the climax, it needs to be believable or the story would fall apart. Robert Zemeckis obviously directs a beauty with Back to the Future and is a joy for audiences from beginning to end.A powerful message emerges as one watches Back to the Future. Many of the film's leads at one point has their character questioned. At the beginning of the film we meet George McFly (Crispin Glover), who doesn't look like he's strayed far from the 1950's even in the 80's. He is getting pushed around in the film, like he has all of his life, and seems to be destined for a life filled with this type of abuse. He seems to have no respect from his family members, or anyone else that comes into contact with him. Marty shows us, through his journey that sometime all it takes to make someone realize they deserve better is a little confidence from a friend. We also learn early on in the film that Marty has a passion for music and a dream to pursue it. He gets a big chance to realize this musical dream at his parent's dance in the past. He convinces his dad to pursue his own writing dream when he visits him in 1955, and seeing his father's dream pan out, one can only assume Marty will take his own advice in the future. One can also take a lesson from Doc Brown's perseverance throughout the film. He is never appreciated for his ingenuity, and often thought of as crazy for pursuing his scientific endeavors. In spite of all this criticism, Doc presses on and remains steadfast in his scientific exploits. There is something in this film for everyone, and the audience is given enough tools to find whatever suits them.Now that I have finally seen Back to the Future, I can understand why it has remained such a staple for decades after its release. This story provides a feel good story of normal, good people overcoming the evils of other normal people. Not an overwhelming moral story to the point where it is cheesy and unbelievable, but one that tugs at this reviewer's heartstrings nonetheless. Back to the Future is a four star prize for me, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes to follow an engaging story with fun characters. One does not even have to be a fan of time travel movies, as I am not, to enjoy this film. I'm glad I finally gave this movie a chance, and I will probably be along for the whole series.",Audience Reception
"All the reasons I love this movie have already been said many times here before. Back To The Future is just a generally great movie, it's the best of its kind. It has a great story and everything comes together so perfectly in the end.I saw this movie when I was a little kid and I was sick in the hospital. I felt so bad being sick, but the movie was so great that it made me forget. It's always been close to my heart. I still enjoy watching it now as much as I did then. Oddly enough, it took me almost 10 years to finally get around to watching part II.I picked up the DVD trilogy recently and believe me, it has everything a fan of Back To The Future could possibly ask for.My rating: 10/10",Audience Reception
"The visual effects are outdated but rarely distract from act. My biggest problem with this movie is that it goes by too quickly, and that's arguably a good thing. The narrative is a little absurd, which is completely fine considering how self-aware, and comedic the whole movie is.",Visual Effects

"Why is ""Back to the Future"" my favorite movie from 1985? Because that was the year I was born! I'll be turning 22 this year, as will this film. Robert Zemeckis has had an astounding career over the last half-century, with other hits including ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) and ""Cast Away"" (2000). But his best will always be ""Back to the Future,"" at least to me. In 1985, wacky, frizzy-haired scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents time travel, that is he builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. A series of harrowing events forces wise-cracking teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to take the DeLorean for a test drive through time, 30 years back to 1955, before he was even born. Never mind the scientific improbabilities and paradoxes present in the script, but McFly must find a way back to '85, before his future is erased by events in the present. You see, he has inadvertently altered the course of events that will lead to his then-teenage parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) meeting and falling in love, and now he must try to get them together with a young Doc Brown's help while also facing off against Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the local tough. ""Back to the Future"" remains a comedy classic, due largely to its mix of special effects fantasy and laugh-out loud moments. The performances are excellent, especially from Fox, who is one of my favorite actors and I do wish him well in the future with his fight against Parkinson's Disease.10/10",Character Relationships

"In the mid-1980s, screenwriters Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had a great idea. Wouldn't it be fun to make a film about a young guy who travels back in time and meets his own parents? When his folks are also teenagers, that is? Unfortunately, their enthusiasm was not shared by a single soul in Hollywood. No one wanted to invest money in such a whacky project. But then, when Zemeckis scored a hit with ""Romancing the Stone"" everything changed. Suddenly every studio in town wanted to do business with the two friends.Robert Zemeckis started shooting ""Back to the Future"" in November 1984. From the beginning, Eric Stoltz was supposed to have the lead role. But although Stoltz was an excellent actor, the director soon realized that he wasn't the right man for the part. So, Zemeckis turned instead to Michael J. Fox, star of the immensely popular sitcom ""Family Ties"". And luckily, Fox was keen to do the job. Even though it meant working on two gruelling projects at the same time.When Michael J. Fox sets off on his time-traveling trip, he uses a gleaming, modified DeLorean. However, that wasn't the case in Zemeckis and Gale's original script. The two authors had actually intended that the journey would start in a converted refrigerator (?) out in the hero's kitchen. Soon, however, the two scriptwriters realized that this could cause problems. Imagine if some kid was inspired by the movie and got trapped inside the family's fridge.Not surprisingly, ""Back to the Future"" became a smash hit, even surpassing ""Romancing the Stone"" at the box office. The film also made Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale the hottest scriptwriting team in Hollywood. In addition, John DeLorean sent a letter thanking the filmmakers for immortalizing his futuristic car. But the biggest proof of the movie's popularity was that Universal Pictures installed ""Back to the Future"" rides in their theme parks in California and Florida.",Cultural Impact
"I am very confused because in the ""cast away"" Zemeckis have made a film that believes in the destiny that is programmed by god but in this movie the doctor have been survived after he had died because of the notes from Marty and the destiny has been changed. what do you think because of i had seen cast away before this , i expect in the meanwhile of watching movie that the doctor will read the message of Marty in 1955 , but any way he will die because this is the destiny and i was so confused after seeing the doctor alive . in the cast away Tom Hanks was a on time man and because of an accident he casted away from civil and he had a new believe that all things are not in his hands and someone from ""up"" is programming for his life and at the end of film , when he was in the road he was at a four way road and he did not know to go from which way and the sight of camera was from ""up"" that seems Zemeckis is showing us someone in ""up"".do you think that the believes of Zemeckis have been changed or something else?",Cinematic Techniques

While in 1955 and after messing up the way his parents met, he must fix this problem to avert another tragedy. The acting and directing in this film is great. The story is funny and some lines made me laugh like a hyena. The music makes the movie sound like a true 80's movie. ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis is an instant classic! Overall, this a movie classic for the ages. I rate this film a 10/10.",Soundtrack Quality

"25 years on, and back to the future is still seen as one of the best films to ever exist. And i completely agree, because this film is a masterpiece - yes i said it a MASTERPIECE!!! so is it as good as everyone says, oh undeniably , but just what makes it so dam good? well they have that catchy and nostalgic theme tune that just brings a smile on my face every time i hear it. They have the wonderful duo of Christopher Lloyd and Micheal J. Fox who are just hilarious together on screen, and then of course is the story.To keep this really short and not spoil anything for those who have not (and should) seen this, the story is about a Young teenager Marty Mcfly ( Micheal J. Fox), who accidentally gets sent back to the past in the year 1955. he travels back in time in a delorean invented by the brilliant Doc Brown ( Christopher Lloyd). Marty must somehow find a way to get back to the year 1985 and try not to change the past for the worst. that is all i am willing to say because this really is a film you must see without not knowing whats going to happen.I think my 2 favourite characters have to be the villain of the movie Biff ( played to perfection by Thomas F. Wilson) and Lorraine Baines ( played by the beautiful Lea Thompson). I Love Biff just because of how big a prick he can be but still funny and charming at the same time. I can guarantee that once you have seen this movie Biff Tannen will be on your personal list of favourite bad guys , because he's high up on the list on mine . I also love the innocent and sweet Lorraine Baines because.......well, because shes so gorgeous , absolutely stunning. i really like the character but in all honesty, iv always had a thing for Lea Thompson so thats probably why i like that character so god dam much haha.So if you are unfortunate enough to have not seen this epic masterpiece then i advise you do. Robert Zemicks and Steven Spielberg have created a franchise that leaves a warm and happy feeling in the hearts of the viewers, which never leaves.

"Back to the Future follows Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), quite a fly guy indeed, that accidentally goes 30 years back in time, one-way ticket. Said accident happened the night that his friend, Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), introduced Marty his newest invention - a time machine. Now Marty, stuck in the past, is trying to figure out how he might come back to 1985, and doing so without erasing his own existence from the timeline - not an undifficult mission, I'll tell you that.Right off the bat, the film shows us one of its best aspects - the smooth flow. The movie is very well-paced, with little to no boring moments, in my opinion. Everything is entertaining, at least in some level, and scenes just fly by sometimes. I think that the Biff scene with the skateboard worked really well because of that thing exactly. Every little thing was fun there, and made the scene more fun to watch.The cinematography and score are both solid - nothing too experimental or unique, but both are very well-made and provide both memorable shots and musical moment, here and there. I think that the soundtrack itself is really fun as well - all the songs that carry hints of time travel, or the ""is it a dream?"" scene, which was definitely improved a lot due to the use of dream-related songs such as Mr. Sandman.I also like the whimsical, chaotic vibes that this film has. It gives the film more of a personality, and it makes the funny moments be much more potent and effortlessly good. Yeah, some time travel gags get a little tiresome, especially all the one liners about how Marty came from the future etc. (some are iconic, some are just a little cringe), but I'd still say that this movie does a good job when it comes to being chaotic in a funny, captivating way.Also, this movie is about how one needs to dare, to take a certain risk, in order to achieve true happiness. It's a cute message and it's delivered well. It doesn't blow me away, obviously, but it's woven into the film in many ways, and I feel like the movie really managed to make it the core, the heart of everything. I definitely appreciate that.There isn't a lot to say about this one - it's whimsical, simple and pretty fun to watch. It has many iconic lines, and the film just flows in a really satisfying way. The message of this film is present everywhere throughout it, and I can really appreciate the decent attention to detail there. Feeling a 7.2/10 on this one.",Cinematic Techniques

"This is one of the few movies my nerdy sci-fi self never cared about if the science was right or wrong, or about any plot inconsistencies or whatever, because it is just an incredibly fun movie from 00:01 to credits. I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times since I was a kid. I can tell you which clock in the opening sequence had the wrong time on it. I can tell you Doc Brown's address both in the past and the present. I know what kind of dog food Einstein eats. I know this movie better than ""Holy Grail"", and that's saying something.

"HAve you ever had a movie experience from years before(let's use as an arbitrary number,five years or more)that was so vivid,so exhilarating that you could recall what day,time and even things as seemingly easy to forget as the smell and tastes of the popcorn and soda you had at the movie?For me,that was this movie,and I recall seeing it on a Sunday afternoon in July,1985. The noise and visuals were so electric that I enjoyed this film immensely. My only regret about the experience was that I didn't get a chance to redeem the ""Free Pepsi with purchase of large popcorn""discount coupons they were giving out that day!In a pleasant,average California suburb,ordinary teenager MArty McFly(Michael J.Fox,who was a youngish 24 when he filmed this) dreams of being a rock guitarist as he works his way through school,helping out brilliant-but-fringe local scientist Dr.Emmitt Brown(Christopher Lloyd,adding to his wide range of characters). When an unforeseen crisis interrupts Doc Brown's breakthrough time-machine revelation,MArty is thrust into the machine and becomes the unwitting first participant in time-travel. As if that weren't harrowing enough,he's just found a way to break up his younger parents BEFORE they met and now he has to feverishly find some way to get them back together,lest he and his sibs will never be born.If you can suspend some level of disbelief while watching this(and,really,when SHOULDN'T you suspend some disbelief when watching Spielberg/Lucas/Zemekis style of sci-fi films?),this film is as smooth as silk and one fun ride! Besides Fox and Lloyd,Crispin Glover(lovably strange and pathetic as Marty's once and future dad,George),Lea Thompson(cute and vapid as once and future mom Lorraine)and Thomas Wilson(thick-headed bully Biff,who is a lost treasure here,too) are excellent in fleshing out the characters that stick in one's mind regarding this film. Heck,Old MAn Peabody,Goldie Wilson,Jennifer PArker,MArvin Berry(cousin of Chuck)and the persistently bald and serious-as-heart-attack high school principal all add their own flairs in this movies persona. Robert Zemekis parlayed his ""Romancing the Stone"" success to create an even larger-than-life action-fantasy-comedy,with help from plenty of sight and sound FX and a hugely energetic soundtrack anchored by Huey Lewis and the News(remember them?). This film isn't just a renter,this is a keeper! Most people with a sense of fun who long for the eighties movies that accented style over dark or haunting substance should definitely buy this one,tape or DVD.",Cinematic Techniques

"The first time I saw this movie, I was like screaming with joy!! I had never seen a more enjoyable and witty movie in my life till then. About the time I was a teenager, thinking about what I would not do to go back in time and change things in the past!!! The 'time travel' trilogy is, I think the best that is, though not scientifically accurate. Robert Zemickis' shots of the DeLorean were amazing and well cut (though somebody reported seeing black gloves on some remote-controlled shots of the DeLorean! - frankly I could not make out the gloves. OK, maybe I am blind!). Michael J. Fox as the young ambitious Marty McFly and his 'Someday Jeniffer, Someday!' remain embedded in my mind. I think Fox plays the teenager to utmost perfection. I have never seen a teenager like that in my entire life!!! Doc Brown remains the most memorable scientists ever played in Hollywood! Christopher Loydd was impeccable, amazing!!! Kudos to Robert Zemickis for creating one of Hollywoods greatest characters in comedy! Amazing performances by Thomas Wilson (Biff Tannen) and Crispin Glover who plays the wimpy 'dad'. Doc's 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything!' has got to be one of Hollywood's most positive dialogs. This is one movie that will always be one my favorites.",Cinematic Techniques

Ranging from the stereotypical bully played by Thomas Wilson, to Marty and the similarities between him and his dad, played by Michael J Fox who at times, sums up a teenager precisely, but most of all the manic facial expressions and insane dialogue from Christohe Lloyd, who plays the mad Doc ""Einstein"" character with such vigour it just makes me smile when he's in the shot, let alone doing something.

"Back to the Future, directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, originated and produced by the great Steven Spielberg, was this highly inventive, and I quote, ""heavy"" film! Back to the Future may not have been the first film to take a shot at time travel, but it's the film that broke barriers, and holds up the most out of Time After Time & Terminator, along with other early titles. This film is so heavily guarded; a lot of people say it's almost a flawless film, with good reason. Back to the Future has so many memorable scenes, having this original style, that many film makers later tried to mimic.Michael J. Fox, has his first major role in a motion picture, and he puts on a phenomenal & energetic performance, making his character, as Marty McFly, very bold, and entertaining! His character development throughout the film brings a lot of an enjoyable wit and comedy, adding great layers, so we can really care about his character. Christopher Llyod, who is most noticed for One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest, put on a trademark performance! Chris Llyod NAILED his performance! He carried himself with this quirky & loud, yet brilliant and thoughtful attitude, that was admirable to all. His character development during the second and third act was the best out of all the characters! Thomas F. Wilson played a great, stereotypical bully, in Biff. He was a clich�� character, and meant to hate, but he is absolutely hilarious.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale was ahead of it's time, along with some of the scenes and risks they took! He crafted a very intelligent and creative script, that flowed just right for the 80's, then flowed even better with the 50's, adding consistent tongue and cheek humor.The score by the up and coming, Alan Silvestri, had this magical, yet suspenseful, and even a few sad tones to it. This score was absolutely phenomenal, backed up with a great song by Huey Lewis & the News, That's the Power of Love.Overall, I can go on and on about how great this film is, completely understanding as to why people would call this film flawless. It is absolutely fantastic!!! With only one notable award from the Academy Awards, being Best Sound Editing, this film has a lot to be proud of, and A LOT of nomination worthy aspects. Robert Zemeckis set up the sequel perfectly, and if I was around in the late 80s, I would have definitely went to go support it.",Cinematic Techniques

"Steven Spielberg is a genius for Produce Back To The Future, he strikes the perfect balance between superior quality and self- depreciation. Robert Zemeckis directs with brisk pacing, making every scene count and sharply defining the key characters. While the film never aims for more than two dimensions, Marty is eminently likable, and Lloyd makes Doc Brown, with his wild white hair and perpetually wide eyes, one of the more memorable mad scientists in movie history.Lea Thompson gets the least showy but most delicate role. The film handles the potentially precarious covetous relationship between the young Lorraine and her teen-aged son with a playfully steady hand, and steers it to an unexpected but in retrospect obvious resolution.The DeLorean leaving flaming tire marks as it launches into time travel is one of my favorite scenes and i love Elisabeth Shue :)",Character Relationships

Overall this is a movie that will disappoint no one, regardless of your movie tastes; it has something for everyone.",Character Relationships
"Back To The Future is one of my most favorite movies ever created. Just everything about this film is pure golden I can't think of one thing that would make Back To The Future bad because it just one of those films that got something right from the start.The film gave us some of the most used and most creative catch praises that we are still using even more after the film's release. It's one of those films I can always sit down and enjoy because it everything that makes it a pure classic.The idea of Time travel is always pure interest and it made the film a hit from the Get go.The music in the film is just superb often times you'll find yourself thinking about the theme song because it really matches the film story throughout also ""The Power of Love"" from Huey Lewis and the News really works well to help with Marty McFly and his love for girl friend Jennifer.The cast did a excellent job with creating some of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema Michael J.Fox was brilliant as the film Main Protagonist Marty McFly he helped created a character that most could related to in their teenage years he was the right man for the job. Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown was no doubt the perfect choice, Christopher Lloyd has always been an amazing actor and like many grew up watching his performance in this film he was just phenomenal in this role one of the smarter casting choices ever he really brought the character to life. Thomas F.Wilson as Biff Tannen was quite the antagonist he just brought back all that we know and hate about bullies and makes you want to cheer for Marty.Using the DeLorean as the time travel car really gave the car it status as part of American motion picture history every time you see the DeLorean you think of Back To The Future. The effects in this film are nothing short of being magical and even today remains impressive.Back To The Future is like a fine wine only gets better with age that's saying something for this classic masterpiece I give Back To The Future a 10 out of 10 Great Scott! When this baby hits 88 miles per hour you're going to see some serious hit",Character Relationships

"My favorite movie is ""Back To The Future"" which is made by Robert Zemeckis. The main point of the movie is time exploration using time-machine. It was memorable from beginning to end. I think the moment that Marty tries to make the link was moving. Because the link could holds two people together. At that moment I thought what would happen to them if Marty does not make his parents meet? I cannot imagine. It is not really predictable. I want to watch other sequels if I have free time.

"Back to the future is one movie that contains excellent visual effects, a nice story plot and the directing is just excellent. The movie has a beautiful screenplay, and the movie puts the full stop in the statement, ""never a dull moment.""Michael J Fox was the desired man cast to play the lead role Marty McFly, but he turned it down due to scheduling conflicts, so Eric Soltz was cast in his place. After filming had begun, Zemeckis and Spielberg felt Soltz was not portraying the character well enough and knew this was a casting error, so they had to re-cast and ask Fox to try and make time to be in the movie. So Fox had to re-arrange his schedule time to be able to shoot Family Ties (TV Series) and the movie at the same time, this recasting meant, an extra 3 million production cost, as all the scenes that Eric had done had to be redone and Fox was so busy, that it was said that he only got 5 hours of sleep a day at the time.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager from the Eighties who befriends a slightly coco scientist Doctor Brown (Christopher Lloyd). During one of their meetings Doctor Brown mistakenly (due to an accident) sends Marty 30 years into the past, 1955 to be exact. Marty while in the past, mistakenly interrupts his parents meeting and he must find a way to fix it or else he will no longer exist. He also has to help the Doctor Brown of 1955 get him (Marty) Back to the future.Back to the Future was a financial success the movie's 100 days production cost was 19 million dollars (including the recasting cost) and it made over 380 million dollars in the box office. It was also a critical acclaim winning an Oscar for Best Sounding Editing.The balance in this movie is what makes it a most watch the movie's transgression from comic to science fiction to romance/drama, is what makes it such a most watch, it takes its time to explain even the complexity of time travel, that at the end even with the slightest of details that made no sense I actually was convinced and doubted not that Doctor Brown did it.Back to the Future is a movie hit for all to see and enjoy, it was that good that two sequels were added to it, Back to the Future II and Back to the Future III although the release dates for the sequels were 1989 and 1990 respectively all maintained the time of 1985 when the first time travel happened.

"I've watched this movie so many times, I can quote the entire movie. I'm not giving anything away by saying it was/is still ahead of it's time. Although the characters' belief that 2015 would be significantly different than our current 2015 actually IS, is irrelevant (actually, it's a comedy so the guesses at reality just makes it funnier!). Robert Zemeckis directed a legendary movie mocked and satirized in many movies afterward. That's the highest praise a picture can garner. This is as near-to-perfection as screen comedy/time travel gets in my book.To put the writing/directing in perspective, I will tell you what my screen writing teacher said about this movie a few years ago when she screened just the opening sequence for our class... She said the opening sequence of nearly five minutes long with few editing breaks sets the stage for what is to come. She said this was how professional screenwriters dream about opening a movie. It's just... flawless. The opening reveals layer upon layer of story themes with very few words, just visuals and a few key noises in the background. Without a single actor in the midst. It's just the setting and a moving camera. We have just been treated to circa-1985 without ever even seeing an actor walking across screen. THEN the actor walks in. It only gets better from there. Magnificence in direction.Watching it again last night made me realize how special of a movie it really was. I simply enjoyed the experience. It transported me back to 1985 all over again. Knowing everything there is to know about the story. And it STILL makes me laugh. The fact they set it in 1985 was a stroke of genius. People in 2015 can only joke about what they believed the future would look like. But the writers/director so very wisely chose to say ""1985"" and not ""Present Day"" -- a date-reference killer once a movie reaches an age where current present day looks nothing like the movie we're watching. That 1985 date also allows for a perfect anchor to bounce around in the future two sequels in the series.I remember watching this in the theater when it was first run in - yes, I was there - 1985. My best friend sitting next to me in the theater watched Michael J Fox stumble along 1955 Main Street and his comment at that moment in the movie was, ""Nobody could play this character better than Michael J Fox."" I have to agree. MJF IS Marty McFly personified. He carries the picture effortlessly and heroically, along with the hilarious and severely underrated Christopher Lloyd as the genius/basket case, Dr. Emmitt Brown. Two genius actors playing off one another, along with the perfect supporting cast, makes this a must-watch movie at any time in history. It is genuinely funny, sweet, nostalgic, witty, beautiful, and exciting. Every scene has something to do with another scene. There is literally not a single wasted frame in this movie. Later episodes of the series aren't as perfect as BTTF1 but that's a different story... If anyone ever creates a time-capsule, PLEASE make sure to include this movie. Future millennia of species will enjoy it too. :-)If you haven't watched ""Back to the Future"" before, regardless of your age or generation, please reward yourself with this near-perfect time-travel comedy. I loved it even more this time around. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. 10 out of 10.",Science Fiction

It's just... flawless. The opening reveals layer upon layer of story themes with very few words, just visuals and a few key noises in the background. Without a single actor in the midst. It's just the setting and a moving camera. We have just been treated to circa-1985 without ever even seeing an actor walking across screen. THEN the actor walks in. It only gets better from there. Magnificence in direction.Watching it again last night made me realize how special of a movie it really was. I simply enjoyed the experience. It transported me back to 1985 all over again. Knowing everything there is to know about the story. And it STILL makes me laugh. The fact they set it in 1985 was a stroke of genius. People in 2015 can only joke about what they believed the future would look like. But the writers/director so very wisely chose to say ""1985"" and not ""Present Day"" -- a date-reference killer once a movie reaches an age where current present day looks nothing like the movie we're watching. That 1985 date also allows for a perfect anchor to bounce around in the future two sequels in the series.I remember watching this in the theater when it was first run in - yes, I was there - 1985. My best friend sitting next to me in the theater watched Michael J Fox stumble along 1955 Main Street and his comment at that moment in the movie was, ""Nobody could play this character better than Michael J Fox."" I have to agree. MJF IS Marty McFly personified. He carries the picture effortlessly and heroically, along with the hilarious and severely underrated Christopher Lloyd as the genius/basket case, Dr. Emmitt Brown. Two genius actors playing off one another, along with the perfect supporting cast, makes this a must-watch movie at any time in history. It is genuinely funny, sweet, nostalgic, witty, beautiful, and exciting. Every scene has something to do with another scene. There is literally not a single wasted frame in this movie. Later episodes of the series aren't as perfect as BTTF1 but that's a different story... If anyone ever creates a time-capsule, PLEASE make sure to include this movie. Future millennia of species will enjoy it too. :-)If you haven't watched ""Back to the Future"" before, regardless of your age or generation, please reward yourself with this near-perfect time-travel comedy. I loved it even more this time around. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. 10 out of 10.",Cultural Impact

"My brother is to blame for my love of this film he used to watch it none stop on VHS back in the day and you get dragged into it just simply by being in the room. I think I have now watched this movie over 50 times if not more and it still keeps it's appeal even now as a young adult I still enjoy watching it and I don't get tied of watching it! The other 2 movies are also well worth watching but you can't beat the original. I love the story line and you get to know each character quickly and you can relate to each one of them especially Marty played by Fox, I understand he was working on family ties and back to the future all at the same time wow he must have been tired.I would like to point out how cleaver this movie is because of the time travel element this is not easy to pull off but they do it so well. This is one of my all time favorite movies and I am sure I will still be watching it when my grand kids are around.",Cinematic Techniques

"When I review films or shows I rate them on what they should be, in my opinion.Back to the Future is funny and has a great story line. Yes it's cheesy in parts but only a little. The 2nd and 3rd are very good as well but the first is definitely the best.Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in it. He portrays a mad scientist very, very well. Best time machine film I've seen.Michael J. Fox plays Marty, a cool kid who is eager to get into the music industry very well as well I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!Back to the Future=8/10",Cinematic Techniques
This movie is a lot of fun the whole way through I love doc and Marty is a fun protagonist. The idea of what's going on and time travel has probably happened a lot but it stems from this and you can see why I think the ending is super sweet and how it just has full confidence and is like oh we have an idea for a sequel too is great cause it shows they had fun doing this and will do more which is great cause nowadays sequels feel forced and undeserved but this is just a whole lot of fun and def deserving of a sequal i remember watching 2 & 3 when I was younger and I'm excited to revisit them this month before they leave Netflix.,Sequel Comparisons
"About once a decade a film emerges that is so original and new that it immediately raises the bar for the rest of mainstream cinema to aspire to, films that are both critically espoused and well supported at the box office.The 70s brought us Star Wars and The Godfather (1 & 2), the 90s The Matrix, Toy Story and The Sixth Sense gave us the 'big twist' ending (for better or worse), the dubbos The Lord of the Rings trilogy (seriously, how many times has it been ripped off already?) and perhaps Avatar, and this decade so far has Inception, which although flawed is an admirable attempt at breaking the mould and creating something distinctly original.The 80s was all about the adventure (Indiana Jones), Blade Runner must be mentioned and the introduction of the macho action hero (Arnie, Bruce, Sly)�� but at equal 4th on the IMDb Top Ranked 80s titles is a 'little' film called Back to the Future, it didn't need big explosions, huge car chases and thousands of rounds of ammunition, just a creative plot and some likable characters to inhabit it.And really that's the entire Back to the Future (BttF) trilogy in a nutshell. The films don't have a huge number of jokes, the action is OK but not mind blowing and there is essentially zero sex and violence. What it does exude in abundance is charm, charm which starts with the most likable 5 foot tall guy of the 80s and 90s, Mr Michael J Fox.Fox plays Marty McFly, a typical 80s 'teen' from Hill Valley obsessed with girls (namely his girlfriend Jennifer), skateboards and music. His family are also typical and loving, his Dad (Crispin Glover) is a nervous and timid wallflower and his Mum is slightly strict but well meaning. The entire family ��� especially Dad ��� is pushed around by a local moron named Biff who has tortured him since school age.To blow off steam McFly has a friendship with a local eccentric scientist named Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc's dabbles in everything scientific and has hundreds of wonderful inventions, none of which have set the world on fire.But all of that is about to change.Doc's latest creation is a time traveling car (a DeLoreon to be specific) that when gunned to 88mph can FF or rewind to any pre-programmed point in history. McFly is dubious but he agrees at the insistence of Doc Brown to show up at an early morning (actually late evening) trial run in a supermarket car park.Using Doc's dog Einstein as the test pilot they give the car a try, and lo and behold the thing actually works! But before they even have a chance to high five and discuss how this new invention will benefit the world Libyan terrorists unexpectedly show up and gun down the Doc, with McFly only just managing to escape in the DeLorean.This one act sets in chain a series of incredible and intricately plotted events that span 3 centuries and several generations of McFly's (and 'Biff's' for that matter��) Marty initially is transported back to 1985 where he is hopelessly out of place. While there he manages to meet his two parents before they even have a chance to get together, his actions inadvertently prevent this from happening, meaning that he must somehow play matchmaker to his own folks else he remove himself from existence altogether.There's a whole lot more to the original BttF, aside from literally justifying his own existence Marty manages to invent skateboarding and rock 'n' roll in his limited stay in 1955, all the while striving to avoid actions that somehow alter the future along the way.I obviously can't go into too much detail but the ending was excellent as well.Now some 25 years later time travel in films is commonplace ��� even Red Dwarf and Futurama have produced excellent episodes dealing with time travel paradoxes ��� and yes I know about The Time Machine and the 'classic' older films dealing with the topic (that I can't name). Back to the Future managed to take a science fiction core and make it interesting to the everyday movie watcher who just wants to be entertained for a couple hours (I am trying to say 'non-geeks'), the original BttF was/and is immensely original and creative, with solid performances plural by Michael J Fox as, well�� many McFly's.It isn't laugh a minute or gasp inducing but you'll go a long while before you find a mainstream film this innovative and enjoyable, and the sequel was even better! Final Rating ��� 8.5 / 10.

Back to the Future managed to take a science fiction core and make it interesting to the everyday movie watcher who just wants to be entertained for a couple hours (I am trying to say 'non-geeks'), the original BttF was/and is immensely original and creative, with solid performances plural by Michael J Fox as, well�� many McFly's.It isn't laugh a minute or gasp inducing but you'll go a long while before you find a mainstream film this innovative and enjoyable, and the sequel was even better! Final Rating ��� 8.5 / 10. Somehow I admire the 2nd film more, but without the elaborate set-ups structured in this film that wouldn't be near as effective, and this film is effortlessly entertaining in any case.",Sequel Comparisons
"The first in the triology from the Speilberg stable.This is a fun, well thought out adventure led by Michael J Fox, who always has that charm to make a movie entertaining.Fox, as Marty McFly, inadvertently stops his parents from meeting after being transported back to the 1950's. From this lies three movies which build upon each other for an enjoyable trilogy of time line mayhem.Fox brings a fun element to a slacker teenager, thrown into a life or death quest that determines his own destiny. Lloyd, as the eccentric professor, makes a marvelous partner to the time bandits; and Thomas Wilson makes a bully that I think we all met in our younger days.Back To The Future is one of those films that marks a time in cinema. It took four years for the sequels to follow, but they needed the time to match the wit and pace of the first.",Cultural Impact

"So I guess I'm not the first person to say this, lmao, but I love this movie! It's such a gem. It has a really sweet sense of humor, and romance, and adventure to it that you don't get in movies that much anymore. Well maybe that isn't totally fair, but you know what I mean.And for a Time Travel movie, it doesn't really mess up too badly in terms of continuity or paradoxes. The movie handles it all pretty much in stride. I can get kind of nitpicky about stuff, and I never felt betrayed or hornswaggled by the filmmakers on this one.I will always suggest this to friends, and if you haven't seen it then put it on your list!",Plot Complexity
"I first watched this film when I was young, it having been recommended to me by my mother, and it remains a favourite still today. The storyline is, of course, a favourite to many, and I just loved it. The idea of time travel and the 'butterfly effect' is portrayed extremely well throughout the film, and Marty's difficulties sticking to the rules of time travel (not helped by certain characters he encounters) never fails to entertain me. The links between the people he meets in 1955 and the people in his life in 1985 are shown so well, and the comedy about the differences in technology always makes me laugh. The film was great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I was younger, as well as later on in my life.",Character Relationships

"I don't care as much about who is directing a movie as some people do, as my top 20 movie list has 20 different directors, but Robert Zemeckis is probably one of my top 5 favorites of all time. Even though I liked Back to the Future more when I was a kid, I think it is an enjoyable flick for both adults and children. Certainly there were things that strained credibility; like the 30-something Lloyd looking 60 something, the people in the picture fading out of existence, and the lightning coming on the exact second of the minute change. But, this is a comedy, as well as a movie trying to deal with time travel, and I am able to put those petty complaints aside enough to realize how entertaining this film is.
I thought that Zemeckis and the actors did a very good job of blending comedy and action together in a smooth fashion. Fox's physical work was impressive to say the least, and I must have laughed at his athletic comedy 3 or 4 times. In short, this is an exciting, funny and memorable film for all ages. I can't say that about very many movies. Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub",Audience Reception

"BACK TO THE FUTURE is a roller coaster ride of an adventure that firmly established Robert Zemeckis as a director to be reckoned with and officially made a movie star out of sitcom star Michael J. Fox. Fox replaced Eric Stolz in the role of Marty McFly, a misfit of a teenager whose friendship with a loopy inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) gets him into quite the pickle. The Doc has actually invented a time machine that transports Marty back to the year 1955, where he meets his parents as teenagers and must unite them romantically in order to exist and return to the year 1985. This film is expertly mounted thanks to detailed direction and a rock solid screenplay. Fox is energetic as Marty McFly and gets wonderful support from Lloyd as Doc Brown and from Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson as his parents. Kudos as well to Thomas F. Wilson, who scores as a perpetual bully in Marty's life. The movie is full of laughs, scares, and even a touch of genuine warmth here and there. If you've never seen it, treat yourself.

Wilson, who scores as a perpetual bully in Marty's life. The movie is full of laughs, scares, and even a touch of genuine warmth here and there. If you've never seen it, treat yourself. Follwed by two sequels.",Audience Reception
"BACK TO THE FUTURE is a roller coaster ride of an adventure that firmly established Robert Zemeckis as a director to be reckoned with and officially made a movie star out of sitcom star Michael J. Fox. Fox replaced Eric Stolz in the role of Marty McFly, a misfit of a teenager whose friendship with a loopy inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) gets him into quite the pickle. The Doc has actually invented a time machine that transports Marty back to the year 1955, where he meets his parents as teenagers and must unite them romantically in order to exist and return to the year 1985. This film is expertly mounted thanks to detailed direction and a rock solid screenplay. Fox is energetic as Marty McFly and gets wonderful support from Lloyd as Doc Brown and from Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson as his parents. Kudos as well to Thomas F.

"Watched this movie for the first time only a few years back and couldn't believe I'd never watched it before. It's a really good story. So many different characters and scenes, story flows well although the mother/son thing is quite weird. 3rd instalment is my favourite.",Sequel Comparisons
"Back to the futur is a film you simply never want to stop watching
I was greatly looking forward to this movie and it didn't disappoint me",Audience Reception
"This was a story that pulls some emotional strings for me. The acting and relationship between Mcfly and the scientist was great and heartwarming. Watching in 2024 adds an element of fun as you can see the predictions of what people thought the future would look like at this time. While the story may just be another ""time travel"" story I feel that this one made it unique and is the best in its category. The DeLorean and special effects I thought were great for its time and you can honestly feel how significant this movie must have been when it originally came out. Hard not to enjoy this movie.",Character Relationships

"This sci-fi would have been perfect if the tacky swearing didn't exist. I despise strong language in films, songs, and tv shows which is why I regularly don't watch them. Although, Back To The Future has an excellent plot and originality. I still think it could be more enjoyable without foul language in every scene! I have only seen it one and a half times in my life for those reasons. It be a lot more times for me if it didn't blurt obscene words in every scene. It's just too inappropriate. What's wrong with those writers anyway? I can tell they don't care about what they put in those scripts.",Science Fiction

"I've never written a movie review, despite having watched so many that I've lost count. I was born in 1981, so when this movie came out, I was just a child. Over 40 years have passed, and I can confidently say that this is the movie I've watched the most times in my entire life. Every time I'm channel surfing and this movie is on, I simply can't resist watching it again. The remote stops right there. I think that says it all. For me, this is the best movie ever made.It doesn't fit into any specific genre, in my opinion. It's simply Back to the Future. For those who lived through the '80s and '90s, they'll surely understand its charm. For those who didn't, I don't have the insight to make any judgment, but I believe it's timeless.",Cultural Impact

No potholes, or bad/awkward moments.4. Screenplay was good.5.

"Anybody who hates this movie probably hates babies and laughs at people when they're a few dollars short at the grocery store as they're picking through their groceries to see what they can put back until they get a little more money. What else could be said to sell Back to the Future in a review? It's an 80s movie but it's really timeless, winding up as a 50s period piece as much as anything else. Flux capacitor's owe their success to Doc, and 88 miles as hour became forever a part of American folklore. If you haven't seen this movie you need to. It's not a piece of art, or a script with many layers of emotional discovery, but it's a fun movie and is something that can be re-watched time and again. Rating 30/40",Cultural Impact
"The creativity of this movie is just spectacular. I caught it for the first time in over a decade recently when there was nothing else on, and being that it was the first time I had seen it from beginning to end in almost twenty years, it just blew me away, brought back so much nostalgia, and made me shed a tear at just how great it was. I just wish I hadn't seen it close to a hundred times as a kid going back to the 80s and 90s and it was my first time ever because even though as a kid it is fun and enjoyable, I'm sure if I saw this for the first time as an adult, it would be even more meaningful as far as filmmaking goes.It's just an absolutely brilliant movie that was so far ahead of its time in so many different ways and couldn't possibly be better. This is what a classic movie truly is, not the garbage the industry has been spewing out for the most recent many years that people try to parade around. Simply put, if you don't want to watch a movie over and over, then it's not a classic, no matter how good you want it to be on the first watch. Zemeckis is brilliant, and Forrest Gump proved he was no fluke.9/10",Cultural Impact

"Back To The Future is one of those films that is universally loved and is one of the most referenced contemporary films of all time. Has there been any other time travel film that has created such an impact as this film? Not that I have seen, but it is arguable as I have not seen many time traveling films.Back To The Future is written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I am just get this out of the way and say that both are not the greatest of writers but they did have created an a concept that is so ambitious and at the same time so accessible that it is hard to not appreciate their writing contributions. Back To The Future's premise is the reason we watch this film and it's the reason that we keep getting hooked to it. Back To The Future's plot is ambitious, at times too ambitious that certain plot holes may be present in relation to the impact of Marty's influence, and the film also has an abundance of humor scattered throughout the film. The humor is one of the main reason that the film is so accessible and beloved, the jokes can be related to both the younger generation and the previous generation even if either generation is from the 50-80s era. The story of just having Marty's mother be infatuated with him, and lightly touches on Freud's Oedipal Complex, is hilarious and ridiculous that it still has it's effect with every viewing. Back To The Future also manages to create the most unique of friendships, a high school student and a slightly off scientist, because these characters are so well written that I didn't really mind the unbelievability of their friendship. Both writers have created a protagonist that is very close to a real teenager during the 80's and made him so appealing that every adolescent males want to be him and all teenage girls want him.Robert Zemeckis now is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary directors and Back To The Future is one of the reasons why that is so. Zemeckis was able to execute a film that has such an ambitious plot while maintaining a campy coming of age tone that can appeal to a multi-generational audience. Back To The Future and Romancing The Stone definitely made Zemeckis an important director and those become a stepping stone for him to create films with more artistic license. Back To The Future was able to create this sense of nostalgia and walk a tightrope between two generations of adolescence. Zemeckis was able to project that ability to recreate a time of adolescent youth that is relatable and fueled by references that defined that time period; Zemeckis has definitely created something that was similar to what George Lucas did for American Graffiti.Dean Cundey started off as a cinematographer of the most popular Horror films of all time, including Halloween and The Thing. After working with Zemeckis on Romancing With The Stone, he did a complete turn around working in much more light-hearted and optimistic films. Cundey did a decent job here and was able to juxtapose two different looks for the film, the dark and dirty look for the 80s and the warm and colorful look of the 50's. Cundey's photography isn't as in your face with nostalgia, like The Godfather, as it consistently takes a more contemporary style throughout the film. Cundey shoots this film to serve the plot and maintaining that accessibility and light hearted tone that Zemeckis wanted instead of drawing attention to itself. The cinematography for this film may not be as loved as the film's writing or musical score but Cundey doesn't slouch with this film.Alan Silvestri was brought in to compose the score for Back To The Future and what a wonderful job he has done here. Silvestri's score here is one of the most memorable film scores that competes with other films like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It has the ability to stick under your skin and will have you bobbing your head when it comes on. Huey Lewis' ""Power of Love"" is so catchy that it just stands out and had me singing the lyrics every time it comes on. The song is able to blend in with Silvestri's score which prevents me from drawing too much attention to it and feeling like it's out of place.Michael J. Fox is the star of this film, embodying this character who is a product of a rebellious and erratic generation. Fox brings personality to McFly by acting like how cool teenage adolescents were like in his time period. When he is sent back in time, Fox was able to portray this fish out of water kind of personality and emotion that makes his entrapment believable. Christopher Lloyd plays the slightly intense scientist who has created time traveling. Lloyd definitely has given such a memorable performance and nobody else was able to capture his performance in any other film. Lloyd was able to balance humor and the seriousness with such flourish that he was to place weight in the story of the scene. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover play Marty's parents and both do a very good job and was able to embody both their young and older self, though at times Glover at the start of the film was quite over the top and had me cringing a couple of times. Thomas F. Wilson was good as a clich�� looking bully ""Biff"". He was able to give off this toughness quality that is able to make the McFly's feel inferior.Back To The Future by now is regarded as a classic and I can see why. This film will appeal to every generation and it's legacy will continue to grow as time passes. Back To The Future is still Zemeckis' best film and will forever remain as a timeless piece of cinema.",Science Fiction

Both writers have created a protagonist that is very close to a real teenager during the 80's and made him so appealing that every adolescent males want to be him and all teenage girls want him.Robert Zemeckis now is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary directors and Back To The Future is one of the reasons why that is so. Zemeckis was able to execute a film that has such an ambitious plot while maintaining a campy coming of age tone that can appeal to a multi-generational audience. Back To The Future and Romancing The Stone definitely made Zemeckis an important director and those become a stepping stone for him to create films with more artistic license. Back To The Future was able to create this sense of nostalgia and walk a tightrope between two generations of adolescence. Zemeckis was able to project that ability to recreate a time of adolescent youth that is relatable and fueled by references that defined that time period; Zemeckis has definitely created something that was similar to what George Lucas did for American Graffiti.Dean Cundey started off as a cinematographer of the most popular Horror films of all time, including Halloween and The Thing. After working with Zemeckis on Romancing With The Stone, he did a complete turn around working in much more light-hearted and optimistic films. Cundey did a decent job here and was able to juxtapose two different looks for the film, the dark and dirty look for the 80s and the warm and colorful look of the 50's. Cundey's photography isn't as in your face with nostalgia, like The Godfather, as it consistently takes a more contemporary style throughout the film. Cundey shoots this film to serve the plot and maintaining that accessibility and light hearted tone that Zemeckis wanted instead of drawing attention to itself. The cinematography for this film may not be as loved as the film's writing or musical score but Cundey doesn't slouch with this film.Alan Silvestri was brought in to compose the score for Back To The Future and what a wonderful job he has done here. Silvestri's score here is one of the most memorable film scores that competes with other films like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It has the ability to stick under your skin and will have you bobbing your head when it comes on. Huey Lewis' ""Power of Love"" is so catchy that it just stands out and had me singing the lyrics every time it comes on. The song is able to blend in with Silvestri's score which prevents me from drawing too much attention to it and feeling like it's out of place.Michael J. Fox is the star of this film, embodying this character who is a product of a rebellious and erratic generation. Fox brings personality to McFly by acting like how cool teenage adolescents were like in his time period. When he is sent back in time, Fox was able to portray this fish out of water kind of personality and emotion that makes his entrapment believable. Christopher Lloyd plays the slightly intense scientist who has created time traveling. Lloyd definitely has given such a memorable performance and nobody else was able to capture his performance in any other film. Lloyd was able to balance humor and the seriousness with such flourish that he was to place weight in the story of the scene. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover play Marty's parents and both do a very good job and was able to embody both their young and older self, though at times Glover at the start of the film was quite over the top and had me cringing a couple of times. Thomas F. Wilson was good as a clich�� looking bully ""Biff"". He was able to give off this toughness quality that is able to make the McFly's feel inferior.Back To The Future by now is regarded as a classic and I can see why. This film will appeal to every generation and it's legacy will continue to grow as time passes. Back To The Future is still Zemeckis' best film and will forever remain as a timeless piece of cinema.",Plot Complexity

I am just get this out of the way and say that both are not the greatest of writers but they did have created an a concept that is so ambitious and at the same time so accessible that it is hard to not appreciate their writing contributions. Back To The Future's premise is the reason we watch this film and it's the reason that we keep getting hooked to it. Back To The Future's plot is ambitious, at times too ambitious that certain plot holes may be present in relation to the impact of Marty's influence, and the film also has an abundance of humor scattered throughout the film.

"Back to the Future is a near-perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, and adventure, earning high praise for its clever storytelling, memorable characters, and infectious energy. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Spielberg, this iconic film has stood the test of time, captivating audiences with its creativity and timeless appeal.The story follows teenager Marty McFly, played with charm and charisma by Michael J. Fox, who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a time machine invented by the eccentric Dr Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd. Marty's quest to return to 1985 becomes a race against time as he inadvertently disrupts his parents' first meeting, threatening his very existence.Fox delivers an effortlessly engaging performance, bringing humour and relatability to Marty as he navigates the past with a mix of resourcefulness and teenage awkwardness. Lloyd is equally outstanding as Doc, with his larger-than-life energy and wild-eyed enthusiasm creating one of cinema's most beloved characters. The dynamic between Marty and Doc is the heart of the film, with their unlikely friendship driving much of the story's charm.The script, co-written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, is a masterpiece of structure and wit, deftly weaving together humour, tension, and heartfelt moments. The way the film balances the high stakes of time travel with light-hearted comedy is nothing short of genius. From the hilariously awkward scenes with Marty's teenage mother to the nail-biting clock tower sequence, every moment feels perfectly calibrated.Alan Silvestri's iconic score amplifies the film's sense of adventure and wonder, while the 1980s rock hits, particularly Huey Lewis and the News' The Power of Love, give the film its unforgettable vibe. The production design is equally impressive, capturing both the 1980s and 1950s with meticulous attention to detail, making the time-jump feel immersive and authentic.The only minor drawback is that certain elements of the plot, particularly the more dated social dynamics, may not resonate as strongly with modern audiences. However, these moments do little to detract from the film's overall impact.In conclusion, Back to the Future is an endlessly entertaining and cleverly crafted film that continues to delight viewers of all ages. With its sharp humour, heartwarming story, and unforgettable performances, it has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films of all time.

"The BTTF movies, I think, should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of ""time travel."" BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ""defines"" a role as few have been defined in films. Plus Thomas Wilson as the various Tannen characters, his great characterizations are too easily taken for granted.The Delorean time machine Doc created is the ""vehicle"" that supports three unique stories in the Trilogy. Most of the ""science"" in the 3 films is ""bad science"", which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a ""science"" explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.In part I, while helping Doc test the time machine in an empty mall parking lot at 2AM, Marty quite accidentally goes back to 1955, to a time where Doc had just discovered the flux capacitor and Marty's eventual parents were to get together at the big high school dance. When Lorraine, again accidentally, gets a crush on Marty he has to repair things to keep from changing his future.In Part II Marty and Doc have to travel to 2015 to keep the future kids out of trouble but a 78-yr-old Biff gets a sports almanac and steals the time machine to give it to his 18-yr-old self in 1955. The resultant gambling and wealth changed history for the worse and Marty and Doc had to use detective work and cunning to set things straight.In part III Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate.To me, it is a mistake to try to judge which of the three movies is ""better"". Each one uses the main characters to create three distinctly different stories. I like to look at them as one long 3-part movie and we periodically watch all three on successive nights. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.In 2015 I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound.",Science Fiction

He has a very classic humor and films in which the mother falls in love with her son would probably no longer exist today. Rightly so, because it provided the one or other cringe moment.Due to the cult status I had very high expectations of the film, which unfortunately were not quite met, but I was not completely disappointed either. The film has wit and you fever with Marty, who tries to bring everything back in order. Like many films from these years, it has a very pleasant mood and you could fully immerse yourself in the story. Even though some elements were very predictable, you were surprised in some places.

Years have passed since I first watched it, but I still watch the movie with the same admiration, it was really great. I thought the movie was pretty good for an 80's movie. The movie's story is also a very original and carefully written story. There are also many references to this movie (The first movie of the movie serie) in the other movies of the movie serie.It was truly one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, and also the best time travel movie I've ever seen.

"Now more than 30 years after its release it's virtually impossible to review BTTF and say something that is new. Almost all observations of the film have already been made and the chance that my review will seem stale and familiar has put me off for years, but now is the time to finally get it done.Since there are as-of-yet undiscovered tribes in the heart of the Amazon jungle who already know the plot of Back to the Future I will forgo typing out a synopsis. Time travel is a tricky device when plotting movies. It can work in your favor or it can destroy you. Both the Terminator and Star Trek have suffered under the paradoxical strain of time travel. I suppose the main lure of the concept is the chance to go back and live key moments in your life and do them differently, putting right what once went wrong - the lifetime pursuit of Doctor Samuel Beckett.Back to the Future is a pop culture giant for many reasons. The iconic poster art, the fire trails, the instantly recognizable DeLorean, the title font, the costume design, the locations, Alan Silvestri's thrilling score, Huey Lewis' emblematic theme tune, but mainly for the dual time period. 1985 was present day when it was released but as I type this review it is 31 years in the past. In 1985 the western world still had a naive innocence, a hope that the future could be bright. Culture was hedonistic, optimistic, willing to experiment. In the three decades since then we have become bitter, pessimistic, and cynical. Dystopia, dysfunction, and distrust has permeated the majority of households. We are no longer a society that plans for the future, only to struggle through the day-by-day grind of increasingly hopeless existence. We long for the glory days of 1985 and Back to the Future allows us to access that dream.But there was an even more naive and innocent time, a world that Marty McFly finds himself trapped in with only a chance lightning strike to send him back home. 1955 Hill Valley (or Kingston Falls if you look at it from a Gremlins perspective) is a post-WWII Utopian Americana where the streets are clean, the world is safe, and the lifestyles are wholesome. It's a rose-tinted insight into forever gone era. Society has grown darker and darker over the decades. We all wish we had a nuclear-powered time machine to stop this ever-declining spiral and skew the timeline into an alternate present.Back to the Future is a good movie, a great movie, a perfectly cast and acted movie, an all time best and a classic for all the right reasons, but its main appeal is that it makes the viewer think ""what if I had that chance?"" I think most people would sacrifice their comfortable familiarity of their known present to go back in time and radically change the future for the better, and what better style to do that in than a DeLorean?This movie will never age. It's an icon of its era and a movie that defines an entire decade. It will stand the test of time (pun intended) and will appeal to each new generation for all of the above reasons.

Fox has got Spin City and everything and he's wishing that the BTTF hype would just quiet down.  But take it from me, if it hasn't quieted down by now, 13 years since the original came out, it isn't ever going to quiet down.  Robert Zemeckis needs to get the ball rolling and make this movie.  Do it for the millions of fans out there that refuse to believe your going to end the greatest series of all time with Doc flying off in a train.

"Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a typical teenager growing up in the 80s. He hopes to make a man out of his milquetoast father, the middle-aged George McFly (a deliciously funny sad sack as played by 20-year-old Crispin Glover) who is still groveling at the feet of his former high school classmate, a perpetual bully named Biff. Marty's prim mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) appears to be drowning her frustrations in vodka. The movie does not really catch fire until, when testing out a souped-up DeLorean as a time machine with his eccentric, wide-eyed, wild-haired stork of a mad scientist friend Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (played by the hilariously frazzled Christopher Lloyd), Marty is whisked back to 1955. Here, he comes face to face with his nerdy teenage dad and also his unrecognizably gorgeous mom. After inadvertently causing his own mother to become infatuated with him ��� who finds him an absolute dreamboat, it is left up to Marty to repair the course of time and ensure that she falls in love with his future father, George or face being erased out of existence altogether. To do so, he gets in touch with a young Doc, who is as much a fish out of water in the past as he is in the present, and persuades him to send him back to 1985. Can he put things right and return to the future before it's too late?Director Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future represents that rare perfect matrimony of everything a film needs to succeed, from the adroit direction, the immaculately styled performances and the scintillating visual effects that never swamp the film. The constituent elements would not operate without the film's biggest triumph ��� its screenplay ��� which is among the most economic and brilliantly composed, for there are no disposable lines of dialogue; everything spoken is either cuttingly funny and heartfelt (check Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as ""a rhythmic ceremonial ritual""), or employed to foreshadow a temporal event later in the film.Anchoring it all is Fox's stumbling charm. The boyishly good-looking Fox is charming as the lead, exuding cocksure ��� yet never arrogant ��� buoyancy. Lloyd, meanwhile, nails his Einstein-on-acid role perfectly, never venturing too far into caricature, yet spinning the archetypal mad scientist role with a wink and a nod, making it unquestionably his signature performance. Together, they make an idiosyncratic couple, for sure, but a perfect one at that.In Back to the Future, there is an effervescence to the filmmaking, a bubbling, giddy effortlessness that's almost addictive. It's ingenuity, time-traveling twist ups and wonderfully vibrant characters resonate in ways few films ever achieve. It is an unadulterated cinematic experience!",Science Fiction

To do so, he gets in touch with a young Doc, who is as much a fish out of water in the past as he is in the present, and persuades him to send him back to 1985. Can he put things right and return to the future before it's too late?Director Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future represents that rare perfect matrimony of everything a film needs to succeed, from the adroit direction, the immaculately styled performances and the scintillating visual effects that never swamp the film. The constituent elements would not operate without the film's biggest triumph ��� its screenplay ��� which is among the most economic and brilliantly composed, for there are no disposable lines of dialogue; everything spoken is either cuttingly funny and heartfelt (check Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as ""a rhythmic ceremonial ritual""), or employed to foreshadow a temporal event later in the film.Anchoring it all is Fox's stumbling charm. The boyishly good-looking Fox is charming as the lead, exuding cocksure ��� yet never arrogant ��� buoyancy. Lloyd, meanwhile, nails his Einstein-on-acid role perfectly, never venturing too far into caricature, yet spinning the archetypal mad scientist role with a wink and a nod, making it unquestionably his signature performance. Together, they make an idiosyncratic couple, for sure, but a perfect one at that.In Back to the Future, there is an effervescence to the filmmaking, a bubbling, giddy effortlessness that's almost addictive. It's ingenuity, time-traveling twist ups and wonderfully vibrant characters resonate in ways few films ever achieve. It is an unadulterated cinematic experience!",Visual Effects
"In the mainstream Hollywood movies of the 1980s, America was a nation in the process of reconciliation. This reconciliation aims to repair the wounds inflicted on America by the movements of the 1960s and the divisions of the 1970s.So Hollywood in the 1980s tells the story of reconciliation between two generations. In the 1982 film ""The Golden Pond,"" not only did Henry Fonda's grandfather and grandson reach mutual understanding, but he also reached mutual forgiveness with his daughter, Jane Fonda, both in the film and in reality. In 1983, the once popular Star Wars series also reached its final chapter, in which the evil father Black Knight was finally influenced by his son Luke, who sacrificed himself to save him.",Character Relationships

"There isn't enough good things I can say about this film.  Robert Zemeckis is definitely one of the best directors out there.  The film has a great story line from start to finish and does a great job of keeping you interested in the characters.Usually movies that deal with time travel don't do a very good job of keeping it feasible (cause time travel is such a bizarre subject), but this movie has a quite feasible story (given that time travel is possible).The special effects are also great, even for today's standards, they're very good!  Well, I guess what I'm getting at is that if you haven't seen this movie yet then you've missed out on greatness.  Please go see this movie! Thank you,-Chris",Visual Effects
"I recently watched this film again after quite a number of years and I was surprised by how well the film has held together.  Its really entertaining, all the characters are likeable, the premise is just great.  This is without a doubt one of the best films of the 80's.  Some of the metaphysical aspects of it may be a little off kilter to do with time casuality, past/present etc..  But that does not stop it from being immensely entertaining, and the basic idea and theories behind the concept of time travel are reasonably correct.  What is great about this film is how they use the science fiction concept as a base without straying away from contemporary mid 80s America. This film has a well deserved place in the top 250.",Cultural Impact
"This is my absolute favorite childhood movie. I grew up with it and i'm extremely excited for it's return to the cinema in October 2015. It tells the story of Marty McFly portrayed by M.J.Fox. A boy who catches his best friend Doc (Emmett Brown) building a time machine out of a Delorean. Unfortunately Doc presumably dies by getting repeatedly shot in the chest by a bunch of Libyans. So Marty escapes from them by using the time machine and goes back to 1955. I am not going to furthermore spoil the plot, but it definitely gets more and more intriguing. Considering this is only the first movie of a trilogy i can honestly say that it is my favorite of the bunch, because of it's originality.",Plot Complexity

"From Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, Back to the Future is one movie that is for sure a classic masterpiece.Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is your typical hip 1985 teenager. He plays in a band, he has a girlfriend, and he has a ton of friends and he lives in Hill Valley. But, his main friend is a scientist named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). When Doc tells Marty about a new invention, it interests Marty immediatley. But what marty doesn't know is that the invention is a time machine made out of a hip Delorian car.When Marty uses the time machine, he accidently goes back in time to 1955! He sees his parents again which leads to him changing events that makes his mother Lorainne (Lea Thompson) love him instead of his father George (Crispin Glover). Another problem is that the time machine is broken. And Marty and the yound Doc think of a plan to use lightning as their tool to getting Marty back to the future!Micheal J. Fox (Spin City, Life With Mikey), Christopher Lloyd (Wit, Camp Nowhere), Lea Thompson (Dennis the Menace, The Berverly Hillbillies), Tom Wilson (Freaks & Geeks, Born to be Wild), Crispin Glover (What's Eating Gilbert Grape).Produced by Steven Spielberg (A.I., Minority Report), and directed by Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath, Forrest Gump).Followed by 2 sequels very worth seeing.A movie for all ages!",Sequel Comparisons
"Back To The Future was the very first movie I saw at the Empire in Leicester Square, London, and will remain in my top ten films of all time for eternity.  A feel good film, a film that made me want to go out and buy a skateboard and learn how to play the guitar, emulating the crazed performance of Marty McFly at the Enchanement Under The Sea Dance!I have watched this film well over 100 times and each time I watch it I get those old memories flooding back to me.  The story itself is essentially something that everyone would want to do - go back in time and change their present.  This film links the impossible to reality and makes your dreams come true, if only for a couple of hours.You can relate to each character in the film at some point and you really do believe that these events, no matter how bizzare, have actually happened.If you haven't watched it then you are either too young or you have been living the past 17 years in a cave!

"Recipe for fun: take one teenaged boy from 1985, a ""mad"" scientist who's obsessed with finally getting his 30-year experiment to work, and a very special Delorean--mix in some family troubles and a complicated love triangle; cut in some quotable dialog; heat it up with plenty of action; remove from the '80s and let cool in the '50s; and top it all with Huey Lewis and the News.There may be one or two people left on the planet who don't know the plot to Back to the Future. Okay: Young Marty is accidentally sent back in Doc Brown's Delorean from 1985 to 1955 and has to contact eccentric Doc's 30-years-younger version to help him get back to the future. (See what I did there? Clever, right?) Marty's biggest challenge is to not change anything in his past that could adversely affect the future -- say, preventing his mom and dad from falling in love, which would jeopardize his very existence. OOops! That's already messed up, so now he must correct the mishap or he'll disappear before he can get back to 1985.Every element of Back to the Future works to create the coolest comedy of its decade. The comic situations that result from Marty trying to play matchmaker to his own parents are very well-played. Of course the best fun comes in when we get to experience (and in some cases, re-experience) the '50s from an '80s perspective. All these good times are helped along by having the easily likable Michael J Fox in the lead and the incomparable Christopher Lloyd as the hyperactive Doc -- a role he was born to play. Unflagging, quotable dialog powers the plot wonderfully.Back to the Future is the kind of movie that can appeal to anybody from ages 10 to 100. When I saw this in the theater in '85 it was an instant hit across all cliques from the nerds to the jocks -- my generation's primer on time travel movies. I remember laughing right along with my mom and my little sisters. Not that many films manage to pull off that kind of magic, then or now.",Cultural Impact

"When you're reviewing a film that you love, it's hard sometimes to describe all the things that you love about it. Which is the greatest challenge I have in reviewing this. I'll try not to go into too much detail, but I will also try to go in as deep as possible as to why I love the film. When the film opens we're introduced to the Character of Marty McFly. He's a typical 80's teen, but also good natured at heart. Marty has dreams and aspirations of being a rock star, but is too unsure of himself to pursue them. He is best friends with the eccentric but lovable, Dr. Emmett Brown. We don't know how Marty and Doc became friends, but we can understand why they are. Doc is always guiding Marty to do what is right, and indirectly showing him to never give up. Their relationship in the film is one I really love, Because Doc is not just a mentor to Marty, he's also a somewhat surrogate parent. The plot is simply this: Doc calls Marty up, and asks him to come help him with his new invention: A Delorean time machine. Things go wrong, and Marty ends up sending himself back in time to 1955. Shortly afterward, Marty accidentally interferes with his parents meeting. So Marty must now try to repair the damage he caused, while Doc tries to find a way to send Marty back home. So, what do I love about the film? To begin with, everything! I love the film's concept: If I knew my parents in high school, would I be friends with them? When you're a kid, the only way to find out how your parents acted when they were your age was to ask a grandparent or relative, but think how different and exciting it would be to actually see it! I love the film's message: ""Never give up, and never stop trying."" I love the performances that all the actors give, and I love the re-creation of the '50's atmosphere. (I'm a big fan of '50's movies, music, and TV shows.) I just love the film all around. Would I recommend this to someone who hasn't seen it? YES, absolutely! Back to the future is one of those movies that you can watch multiple times, and with each time, it still holds as much magic as the first.",Character Relationships

BTTF is the first movie in the brilliant original trilogy, and is indubitably the best of the three!Smart writing, excellent performances, memorable soundtrack, terrific special-effects and just about everything you can ask for in a highly enjoyable ride that you will remember for a long long time is in this beauty of a movie! I remember seeing it for the very first time over seven years ago and I couldn't care less about it, but when I saw it again last month, I've been watching it regularly around twice a week!!BTTF is a fast-paced laugh-fest, unlike the many comedies out there, and it is a MUST MUST MUST-SEE! Fox is great and I doubt if the movie would have been even half as enjoyable if Eric Stoltz (who was replaced by Fox) played Marty McFly! Lloyd is absolutely amazing as the hyperactive Doc Brown, but the show stealer is Crispin Glover as the wimp father of Fox's McFly! His George McFly (from 1955) has just gotta be seen!

"Yet another classic 80s movie! It seems most of the good movies were always made sometime in the 1980s! BTTF is the first movie in the brilliant original trilogy, and is indubitably the best of the three!Smart writing, excellent performances, memorable soundtrack, terrific special-effects and just about everything you can ask for in a highly enjoyable ride that you will remember for a long long time is in this beauty of a movie! I remember seeing it for the very first time over seven years ago and I couldn't care less about it, but when I saw it again last month, I've been watching it regularly around twice a week!!BTTF is a fast-paced laugh-fest, unlike the many comedies out there, and it is a MUST MUST MUST-SEE! Fox is great and I doubt if the movie would have been even half as enjoyable if Eric Stoltz (who was replaced by Fox) played Marty McFly! Lloyd is absolutely amazing as the hyperactive Doc Brown, but the show stealer is Crispin Glover as the wimp father of Fox's McFly! His George McFly (from 1955) has just gotta be seen!

"The majority of 80's comedies have aged very poorly. They are not all necessarily bad, but they have a distinct 80's feel. This is not as much of a problem with Back to the Future, probably because a large part of it does not take place in the 80's! Although it does have more of an 80's feel than its sequels, I think Back to the Future will be enjoyed by audiences for many more years to come. The film has a wonderful blend of comedy, science fiction, and action so that it works on many different levels. Robert Zemeckis and the crew were able to create a perfect 1950's atmosphere, with great sets, 50's music, and 50's television shows.Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents a time machine out of a Delorean (a perfect choice for its futuristic look). Marty travels back to the year 1955 and accidentally prevents his father from meeting his mother, endangering his own existence. He must enlist the help of a younger Doc Brown to repair the time machine and get his parents together before he literally disappears! Things go awry when Biff (Thomas Wilson), the bully who controls George McFly's life, interferes with Marty's plans at every turn.The relationships between these characters really elevate this film above its sequels. Lloyd and Fox have terrific chemistry and are always a riot in every scene together. Crispin Glover is hilarious as the nerdy George McFly, and Lea Thompson is a delight as Lorraine Banes, Marty's mother. Marty's scenes with his parents remind us that our parents were once teenagers too. Marty learns that he has more in common with his parents than he thought. He has the same fears as his father and his mother's rebellious spirit. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty that should be disgusting, but Thompson's charm and Fox's awkwardness make it hilarious.I should devote some credit to the film's special effects and action scenes. In order to go forward in time, Marty and Doc have to harness the energy from a bolt of lightning and channel it into the flux capacitor (which makes time travel possible) while driving the Delorean at 88 miles per hour. This sequence remains one of the most exciting scenes I have ever watched, in large part due to Alan Silvestri's score, and I love how they were able to give the clock tower a significant role in every Back to the Future movie. The time machine going back in time is just as impressive today.Back to the Future is my favorite film by Robert Zemeckis, and I doubt he will top it.",Character Relationships

"We've all looked in our parents picture albums of their childhood. In back to the future you can see what actually happened.Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has made a time machine out of a DeLorean. Modern day (1985) teenager Marty McFly (Micheal J Fox) accidentally travels back in time to the year 1955, interrupts his parents first meeting and has to get them together without affecting the time-line.Back to the Future (1985) is a sci-fi, drama, comedy but above all, feel good movie that draws from almost every film genre, as a result there's something there to enjoy for everyone. Watching multiple times is preferred to pick up the subtle details (watch the name of the mall).This movie along with it's two sequels is one of the few films that you can watch over and over again and it never gets boring. The sheer joy, the adventure, the humor and the basic themes and questions it deals with, make this to be one of the best films ever created.Also a great film for kids to have fun and learn something about how live was in the 80's and 50's at the same time.I can't wait for a future re-release that is re-edited so that the entire trilogy can be watched as one six hour long film without interruptions.10/10",Audience Reception

This movie deserves to be amongst the classics. Michael J. Fox did outstanding and who could ever forget Christopher Lloyd in his role as Doc. He made me think that there actually was a real Doc. Both actors are excellent along with Crispin Glover playing George McFly. Glover does very well in his roles. I would like to see him in better movies. I chose the sequel over the original though. The reason being that the sequel involved new stuff and a bit of the original stuff. This movie should not be forgotten. There wont be one like it. Im surprised the delorium wasnt sold out at the time. were they that badly made?,Sequel Comparisons
"Back to the Future is the perfect movie. After countless (upwards of two dozen) viewings, I am convinced that it is flawless and in my opinion, the most enjoyable movie ever made. The movie's premise is teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time and screws up his parents' first meeting. What separates this from any other sci-fi movie is the constant humor and more than anything, the fun that everyone so clearly had in making it. The actors are all great and perfectly cast, and the movie is never boring; literally every moment is enjoyable. And it seems to get better with every viewing. From the opening song ""The Power of Love"" to the fantastic climactic ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" Dance, Back to the Future will captivate you. My favorite movie of all time is a timeless classic that will never get old and gets better every time I watch it. A perfect 10/10!",Soundtrack Quality
"This movie could be seen a thousand times, and in fifty years, I'll still love it as much as the first time. The best movie of the eighties and perhaps, the most entertaining movie ever made. What makes this movie is the incredibly funny script, an ingenious story and excellent performances by the entire cast. Without doubt, a classic, that will always be remembered and looked back on, even in a hundred years time. This is Robert Zemeckis' best movie, with huge thanks to Spielberg as well. By far the best of the trilogy, although II and III are both great (100 % for I, 85 % for II, and 90 % for III).",Sequel Comparisons

"Run Marty Run is a euphemism for the loss of Marty's integrity. Marty was doing badly in school and doc did not know what to do about it. Especially in math class, Marty was doing very badly. And doc loved Marty and did not know what to do about it. So he created the time machine so that Marty would learn how to count better and he did not want to hurt Marty's feelings by telling him that he knew how badly he was doing in math class. Doc had covert intelligence reports on how Marty was doing in school. So the time machine was just a way to teach Marty how to count better without hurting Marty's feelings.

"Quite simply the most entertaining time-travel movie ever. The story is magnificent all the way, expertly written with some of the most memorable dialog ever to grace the silver screen. It's lighthearted approach is spot on, the film has a suspenseful finale and last but not least the cast is the best.Michael J. Fox is just perfect in the lead and Christopher Lloyd is even more perfect as the crazy scientist who invents time-travel. Crispin Glover is hilarious as Fox's Dad, Leah Thompson has never been lovelier and Thomas F. Wilson is a riot as the ultimate bully (Wilson proved to be Part II's sole saving grace).Terrific filmmaker Robert Zemeckis directs with a sure hand, the film is fast paced, has a great soundtrack (Johnny B. Goode has never sounded better), great special effects, in short; Back to the Future has everything that a great comedy is supposed to have, in spades.Must have seen like 20 times and I never tire of it.

There, he meets his parents and accidentally prevents them from falling in love, which endangers his very own existence. Now he has to get them together while also getting back to 1985 through the help of the Doc Brown of the year 1955.It is a fairly simple premise, but the overall execution is sooo damn good that you don't really think about the simple nature of the story.I love this movie and I am so happy that Zemeckis and Gale still hold the rights to this film(s) close to their chest, because this is one of the film(s) that you really shouldn't try to remake, because it is simply impossible to top the original.10/10, would recommend.",Soundtrack Quality

"Still an instant classic my books, Back to the Future for me was the ""ultimate"" in family entertainment.It's even more of a blessing to learn that the DVD is coming soon, which should really please ""Die-Hard"" fans.Michael J. Fox was a real role model to look up to in this film. Everything his character was, was something I could relate to in terms of wishing for a better life than that of his previous time existence.It's just a ""REAL"" shame that films like this don't get to be made with the same passion and enthusiasm as before. Try to do yourself the favor of avoiding watching too much commercial crap out there that tries to hard too hard to take after films like this and begin re-live classic films that still know how to please those since childhood.My only dissapoinment about the film was Claudia Welles' character of Jennifer Parker, considering that she didn't bother reprising her role in the next two installments, paving the way for a rather wooden Elisabeth Shue to take over the role.Since the Star Wars trilogy and E.T. can enjoy 20th anniversary re-releases, why not trying to add Back to the Future to the equation. It wouldn't be a bad idea at all the newer generation to really appreciate genuine Speilberg/Zemekis films of past and present.Let the good times roll. 10/10",Sequel Comparisons

"A highly entertaining film, paying considerable attention to detail and supported by a brilliant cast, Back To The Future will always be one of my favorite films of all time. Packed with great humor, fantastic action sequences and one of the best soundtracks you'll find, there's no reason not to take a trip back to 1985 and watch this truly awesome sci-fi comedy. Unless of course, your Delorean's out of Plutonium.My only complaint about the film is that I had to wait so long for the sequels.

Packed with great humor, fantastic action sequences and one of the best soundtracks you'll find, there's no reason not to take a trip back to 1985 and watch this truly awesome sci-fi comedy. Unless of course, your Delorean's out of Plutonium.My only complaint about the film is that I had to wait so long for the sequels.

"Well made film with Fox expertly giving his all as Marty McFly, who boards a DeLorean time machine and finds himself at his parents senior year in 1955, helping his wimpy father court his mother. Still fantastic special effects and still a very entertaining movie.",Visual Effects
"This film will always be a classic. Some will call it corny, or even hokie, but it put a new spin on an old sci-fi storyline. And it was even funny! Granted, the whole concept was beaten into the ground with two sequels, the original film in the series demonstrates the timeless nature of this movie. History is always set in stone, but to provide the fantasy of minutely changing your current history is always fun to think about. This was also one of the first movies I actually watched in a theater, so I tend to have some sentimental value placed on this film. But then again, it's well deserved.",Sequel Comparisons
"One of the most genuinely enjoyable movies for enjoyment's sake.  I just cannot conceive how they could have made this a better movie.   It seems like Fox was born to play McFly, and try as he might, he can never get away from the part now.  Although he's done good work elsewhere, this is the one he'll be remembered for.  His defining role.   As someone else mentioned, Lloyd overacts, but somehow I never mind.  Lea Thompson has an indefinable quality, so I won't even try.  Crispin Glover is just wonderfully weird as George McFly.  No one could have played the role like him, and I think perhaps the reason the sequels suffer a bit in comparison to this one is his absence (tighter scripting would also have helped...)  Still, don't wanna give the guy a big head, 'cos when all's said and done he aint the star of the show...   What's also impressive about this is the attention to detail.  It would have been so easy to turn out a pale imitation of what we actually got with this premise, but thankfully the film-makers didn't.  Every little in-joke and movie reference adds to the created universe and involves us more with the characters.  Thanks guys, you can tell you had a lot of fun with this movie.   Also, there is no better director than Robert Zemeckis for creating escapist cinema.  This is a bona fide classic and will be no matter how far into the future you travel...",Sequel Comparisons

Lou: You want a Pepsi pal, you're gonna pay for it. Within that one single exchange between Back to the Future's (1985) protagonist Marty (Michael J.

Marty has traveled back thirty years into the past and is slowly coming to terms/panicking about where he is and how he got there. Studebakers and old Mustangs drive by the window, the future mayor of Hill Valley (played by Donald Fullilove) mops behind him and a younger version of his father (Crispin Glover) sits right next to him. Yet all the audience is supposed to pick up is that the lingo in Hill Valley circa 1955 is completely different than what he's used to which leads to this hilarious exchange.While Pepsi Free no longer exists and Tab is��well Tab, the fact still remains that Back to the Future remains the epitome of a timeless classic. It's a classic based on its plot: a teenager who has befriended an oddball scientist (Christopher Lloyd) goes back into the past with his time machine and has to get back. It's a classic based on its sub-plot: said teenager messes up his mother and father's first meet and has to make the two fall in love before he's never born. It's a classic because of its state-of-the-art special effects which really haven't aged all that much and it's confident direction led by Robert Zemeckis.

How many times have you seen time travel in a movie and ask yourself honestly, whose done it any better?Back to the Future made full fledged movie stars out of its likable leading man Michael J.

He's the gold standard of mad scientist that all future lab-coated eccentrics have to reach before I can deem them worthy. Fox's lovable Marty is smart, creative and surprisingly full of energy. Up until that point Fox had a regular gig on Family Ties (1982-1989) and had to work both projects averaging five hours of sleep for three months to finish the picture; it's a wonder he doesn't look like a wax statue.It is said that Robert Zemeckis had tried for months to get a meeting with Steven Spielberg before finally bursting into his office unannounced and showing him his USC student film. Spielberg (German for childhood hero) would go on to executive produce his first few movies including the solidly acted box-office failure Used Cars (1980). Around that time, Spielberg also produced films by Joe Dante, Chris Columbus and Kevin Reynolds, but it was Robert Zemeckis who left the biggest mark on cinematic entertainment. It was his attention to detail and early adoption of computer generated special effects in Back to the Future that established Zemeckis as a technical wunderkind. Zemeckis would follow the success of Back to the Future with the equally inspired Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and has since become a producer/director himself.Yet Back to the Future remains a timeless package of an auteur at his zenith. A tight, clean story told with energy and panache. It has no equal and will likely never be pushed off its perch as the king of unfettered quality entertainment.

"There aren't too many time travel movies around, mainly because ""The Time Machine,"" ""The Time Travelers"" and ""Time After Time"" films pretty much covered the subject. Then ""Star Trek"" used up the premise in its TV episodes and films, and there was even that ""Time Tunnel"" TV series in the mid-sixties. One option was to do such a movie with humor, pointing out the potentially absurd ramifications of traveling to your own past. So the main character of Marty McFly (Fox) ends up meeting his own parents when they were his age. Though this is a relatively tame comedy as far as teenage comedies of the eighties, there is the risky Oedipal element of Marty's own mother having the hots for him. This concept is then tossed aside near the end when, in a rather lame scene, his mom stops her advances because she suddenly feels like she's kissing her own brother. Disney should've went with this after all - it's possibly the least offensive picture of the decade and probably also explains its huge popularity - everyone could enjoy it.What elevates this above the common film are a few things: Glover's performance as Marty's father, both in younger & older incarnations, is deliriously eccentric; where everyone else is kind of in TV-movie mode, he's off in his own zone and hard to forget. There's an energy to the entire story thrust (from director Zemeckis), helped by Fox, who always seems anxious about something. The concept of time travel itself gets a clever redux here; we find out you can actually change reality in the present by your actions in the past - there's no mention of creating a parallel universe, for example. The ending is pretty strong, throwing in an extra whammy when we think things are over and everything is back to exactly the way it was. And it's very entertaining to watch Marty explore the fifties - we see through his eyes - the culture shock and making various connections between the older and new decades is a nice routine.

"Back to the Future is the quintessential eighties movie. It's over the top, kitschy, silly and lots of fun; pretty much what eighties movie making was all about. However, despite being an eighties time capsule; this movie is still well received to this day and will continue to be fun for cinema audiences for generations to come. The reason? Because in spite of being a predominantly fun flick; Back to the Future is a complete piece of cinema. It has it's heart in the right place, it's very funny, it draws themes and parallels from how times have changed, it has interesting characters that you can feel for and it's a lot of fun. Back to the Future is a masterpiece in it's field for all these reasons. We follow Marty McFly; a young slacker who is good friends with a genius inventor, Doc Brown. The fun starts when Dr Brown invents a time machine from a Delorian automobile and after certain events transpire, Marty finds himself in 1955...with his parents as teenagers and without any means to get back to 1985.The idea of going back in time and meeting your parents when they were young is an intriguing one for sure, and this film makes best use of that fascinating (not to mention hilarious) idea, as Marty finds himself the object of his mother's affections. This sort of premise writes itself, and it's so delicious that there's no way it can fail, and fail is anything but what it does. This situation that the movie creates proves itself to be constantly entertaining and the film draws most of it's jokes and parodies from it. The film also details how the things we do can have massive repercussions on our future; but again, it does it with a huge smile on it's face. I'm a big believer that movies don't have to be entirely serious to have a point, and this movie proves that. Also of note is the way that Back to the Future draws parallels between how things were, and how they have changed. It's just little things, like the way Doc Brown confusingly asks if there's a gravity problem in the future after Marty's continual references to events being 'heavy'.Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly and does a great job with it. This actor was born to play this role; he completely looks and acts the part that you would expect this character to be, and for that reason; he is one of the finest casting choices of all time. Just like the Delorian motor company, Fox never got another good gig after this film, which is an ode to how well cast he was. Also like Fox, Christopher Lloyd's role in this film was the making - and the ending - of his career. He is so magnificent and so well fit to the role of the Doc that it's hard to imagine him doing any other type of role. It's a shame for him, but a treat for the audience. Further great castings include Crispin Glover as Marty's dad, George and Lea Thompson, who is all smiles and sweetness as his not bad looking at all, mother.Back to the Future is, if you'll excuse the pun, a timeless classic. It is fit to be enjoyed by people of all ages and generations, and the fact that it's very much an eighties movie never gets in it's way.",Character Relationships
"This movie may have came out when I was only 3, but it is my all-time favorite because it combines suspense, comedy, and mystique all together in the same film. The casting was intense with the hilarious Christoper Lloyd playing the eccentric Dr. Brown, and Michael J. Fox as the typical 80's teenager Marty McFly. I won't give the movie away, but Marty must get back from 1955 to his era of 1985 AND make sure that his parents fall in love. Otherwise, he and his siblings will never be born! The next 2 movies may have been less than amazing, but this movie starts it all. If you like action-packed, comic, and otherwise amazing movies you will simply fall in love with this movie. i guarantee it",Sequel Comparisons

"BTTF is a magical film that can be watched again and again and never tires. I first saw it when I was about 10 years old and it became an instant personal favourite, somewhat due to the fact that the ""future"" coincided with my own year of birth.Conceived by the highly talented duo of Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis (the two Bob's), it tells the story of a 1980s teenager who is accidentally transported back in time to the 1950s in a plutonium-powered DeLorean created by an oddball scientist. His brief trip back in time turns into a nightmare after he inadvertently prevents his parents from meeting and subsequently jeopardises his own existence. Working with the 1950s counterpart of the scientist who created the time-machine, he must find a way to make his parents fall in love and get back to the future.On the surface, the story seems rather simple and straightforward, but if you look deeper, you will find that this film has many complex layers, which make it an utterly brilliant piece of work.It is also full of coincidences. For instance, our time-travelling hero, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels from 1985 to 1955, with the latter been exactly 30 years in the past. There are countless other coincidences that are scattered throughout the film, many of which can be picked up after repeat viewings. Picking up and identifying new things can be quite fun.Get lost in time and enjoy the film!",Plot Complexity
"I first caught Back To The Future when i was very young, one Christmas at home. I was only born in 81, so i was hooked from early childhood.I have to say that i never have got bored of this film, no matter how many old VHS tapes i wore out through watching. With the sound off i could tell you every word, and hum along to every tune.The combination of Lloyd and Michael J Fox is inspired, with the youthful cheek of Marty and the crazy flare of the Doc. Every scene is full of rich acting, maybe not the heavy Oscar winning performances, but i think better, in that it just feels real. I will never get tired of how Fox can act so naturally.Another element for me is the iconic Delorean, being a car fan i think its a great choice, and at about 5 years old it just looks amazing! I have read one of the early release scripts from about 84, where the Delorean was going to be an RV, and the Doc was a womaniser. I'm very glad it did not come out that way.It is also one of just a few films unspoiled by its sequels, even if II did loose a little in story depth, III helps to just bring them all together.Just thinking about it now, I think i'll have to break out the DVD box set.",Sequel Comparisons
"""Back to the Future"" good film or astonishing film?""Back to the Future"" is a film loved by many. Specifically, ""Back to the Future"" is exciting and adventurous. Moreover, it has great acting. Subsequently, the series of events was so good they had to make 3 movies to fit the whole plot of the story. ""Back to the Future"" is a brilliant movie.Fundamentally, ""Back to the Future"" is extremely thrilling and venturesome. Presumably, the main characters Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) go back to the future. Accordingly, the main character, Marty McFly, goes to the past in a time machine made out of a DeLorean. Ultimately, he causes a lot of issues and starts to fade away. Significantly, the main attraction that people look for in a good film is the acting. Furthermore, when the director of ""Back to the Future"" ( Robert Zemeckis), hired actors such as Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson and Claudia Wells, you won't get anything less than superior. Additionally, the characters in the movie do not leave in the second and third; each piece to the puzzle overlaps and you'll find characters in the same place that they were left in the very first film. On the other hand, time travel isn't real and is initially impossible. Some may find it childish and absurd. Conversely, isn't that why people watch movies? To get the feeling that they went somewhere else; to feel as if they really preformed the action the character just attempted. ""Back to the Future"" is an adventure like no other and is suspenseful throughout the entire production. Comparatively, most films have an easy plot and the story line is plain yet dull. However, ""Back to the Future"" is not like that at all. To demonstrate, the first movie of the series was spectacular. Initially, it had a great special effects and left you on a cliff hanger in the end when Dr. Emmett Brown says ""roads, we don't need roads"" and the DeLorean takes off into the sky. Henceforth, the characters go through three main settings; The Past, The Future, and The Wild West. The very end of ""Back to the Future"" is astounding and inspirational.

"""Back to the Future"" good film or astonishing film?""Back to the Future"" is a film loved by many. Specifically, ""Back to the Future"" is exciting and adventurous. Moreover, it has great acting. Subsequently, the series of events was so good they had to make 3 movies to fit the whole plot of the story. ""Back to the Future"" is a brilliant movie.Fundamentally, ""Back to the Future"" is extremely thrilling and venturesome. Presumably, the main characters Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) go back to the future. Accordingly, the main character, Marty McFly, goes to the past in a time machine made out of a DeLorean. Ultimately, he causes a lot of issues and starts to fade away. Significantly, the main attraction that people look for in a good film is the acting. Furthermore, when the director of ""Back to the Future"" ( Robert Zemeckis), hired actors such as Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson and Claudia Wells, you won't get anything less than superior. Additionally, the characters in the movie do not leave in the second and third; each piece to the puzzle overlaps and you'll find characters in the same place that they were left in the very first film. On the other hand, time travel isn't real and is initially impossible. Some may find it childish and absurd. Conversely, isn't that why people watch movies? To get the feeling that they went somewhere else; to feel as if they really preformed the action the character just attempted. ""Back to the Future"" is an adventure like no other and is suspenseful throughout the entire production. Comparatively, most films have an easy plot and the story line is plain yet dull.

"Christopher Lloyd stars alongside Michael J. Fox in the fantastic Back to the Future. Essentially, the plot revolves around time travel��� Marty McFly (Fox) goes back in time, messes around, and accidentally causes his mother to fall in love with him instead of his father. He has to fix his mistake or else he may be wiped out from existence.Robert Zemeckis was the perfect man to direct this film. In it, I couldn't help detecting some of the spirit of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (one of my favourite movies). This movie can be thrilling or exciting, but the key element throughout is fun. This is simply a fun film to watch. Cultures from the 80s and 50s clash, Marty discovers his prudish mother was once a teenager like him too, and in general, the film proves to be enjoyable.The film's music (a fantastic score composed by Alan Silvestri) really epitomizes the spirit of fun that permeates the film. Its triumphant tones at certain key moments are not obtrusive; instead of adding to the awareness that one is watching a movie, it seems to engross the viewer even more.I will freely admit that the film's outcome is evident from the very beginning. However, the road that takes the audience there is full of fun, unexpected twists and turns.The Verdict: Plain, old-fashioned fun, and it can be the topic of discussion for hours (although I've avoided it here for spoiler purposes). A great movie.Overall Rating: 10/10",Soundtrack Quality
"Back to the Future is the one the best movie I've seen in my entire life! The main reason I liked it was the plot, characters, well everything! I won't reveal it since it's not fair to some people that have never seen it. For first timers: I guarantee you will not regret watching it and will want to see it, over and over again! Even though it's been 25 years since they released it, the classic never died. Every time I watch it, the movie still feels like new! I once heard a rumor they may do a remake and they might use Bieber as Marty McFly (I pray to god he won't be in it!!). I don't want to see a remake happening, not just Bieber, because it destroys the classic. But that's just my opinion.",Plot Complexity
"I just got back from a 25th Anniversary Screening of ""Back to the Future"" at The Puente Hills Mall. Which is the same Mall that was used for the film. It's like stepping into a time machine and going Back to the Past.As a child I used to watch The BTTF Trilogy all the time on video. My favorite ride at Universal Studios was the BTTF ride. And I got really excited when the Trilogy was released to DVD.Now as a teenager, I got extremely excited when I read that there was going to be a Re-Release. The showing was awesome, there were so many other fans, there was clapping during just about every scene.Now for the film. The film follows a really simple plot (which is rare for most time travel adventures). The jokes seem new every time I watch the film. They're always hilarious. And I have to credit the Amazing Cast and Writers for that.For a Comedy, the movie packs a lot of suspense, the climax is beautifully put together with its race against time situation.And what else can I say that hasn't already been said? The movie is one that every person in the world should see. It's really one of the Best Movies of All-Time 10*** out of 10***",Plot Complexity

You will be swept along on a wave of pleasure.Every time I see it I marvel at the imagination, the humour, the sheer joie de vie of a film for which no audience member could fail to be moved and thrilled.Truly a cinematic masterpiece and a treasure for all ages.(And the sequels are great too!)",Plot Complexity

"I first saw 'back to the future' with my dad when I was about seven years old. Now over eight years later I have seen the film hundreds of times and it is still one of my favourite movies.The film tells a simple story of teenager Marty (perfectly acted by Michael J Fox) who is accidentally sent back thirty years in time to when his parents were teenagers. His only hope of returning to his life in 1985 is his scientist friend 'Doc' Brown (also perfectly acted by Christopher Lloyd). In the meantime his teenage mother has formed a crush on him after he saved his father and again accidentally ruining what should have been the start of their relationship.If you haven't yet seen this movie 'WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???' The acting and casting is perfect, the directing, the special effects, absolutely everything in this movie is perfect. One of the funniest, most watchable movies ever created.10/10",Visual Effects
"I can rarely ever watching anything twice, let a lot three times and I'll watch this movie at least once a year. It's just such a great feel good movie and the casting of all the characters is just so perfect. Also I'm not a fan of sequels but its different for this. It feels more like one long story spread out across three movies then the typical ""revival"" of a film.I would recommend this film to just about anybody! It doesn't matter if your a kid or retired, you'll probably enjoy and appreciate how advanced this movie was for its time.",Sequel Comparisons
"This summary perfectly describes my feeling after seeing this movie.The movie is pure....genius. The plot is entertaining till the last minute, the great effects, the exceptional acting from Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lyod.This movie has great qualities for any sci-fi fan. Time-travel, alternate-universes, and DELOREANS! Furthermore, there is little to no errors in the film. There may only be a irk or two in the plot, but it still doesn't take away from the incredible film experience that Steven Spielberg chose to call ""Back to The Future""!

"Back to the Future is a movie about high schooler Marty McFly who has befriended a scientist who has a discovery worth a look. Doctor Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at the mall, where he reveals a Delorean... made for time travel. The Delorean is the vessel for Marty's adventures in this very well put together trilogy. In the first movie, Marty goes back to 1955, the year his parents met. Marty tries to get back home, but the Delorean won't start, so he has to live in 1955 for a while. In 1955, Marty finds Emmett Brown, and has to convince him that he helped him travel back in time 30 years later. Emmett is Marty's only hope in getting back to 1985, but Marty's being there in 1955 has changed a few things; so even if he does get back to the future, things could be different. Can Marty get everything back to normal and get back to 1985? Find out! Once you watch the first one, you'll HAVE to watch parts II and III.",Plot Complexity
"Of course it's not the most serious or deep movie in the world, but it's 1 hour and 48 minutes of pure fun and excitement. This movie was a a classic when it was new, and it has dated well.

The acting and casting is spot on, the effects are revolutionizing for it's time and the story is brilliant, not very logical but who cares.Michael J.

"I've a history enthusiast so time travel films tend to be generally interesting for me and Back to the Future is arguably the best time travel movie of all time. The setting and years that the film took place I suppose could've been better, I think I would've preferred there to have been scenes involving 3 different years in this movie but just having 1955 and 1985 worked very well with the complex entertaining plot this film gives us. 1950's and 1980's USA are certainly not my favourite historical periods but they are both definitely interesting history periods so overall I really liked it and loved seeing the contrast and changes of the various buildings in Hill Valley in 1955 and 1985. It would've only made small difference in years in the film's time setting but I would've preferred Marty to have gone back to 1960 or the late 1950's instead of 1955 and had pretty much the same story with his parents except it would be 4 or 5 years later and that way they'd be more of a Rock n Roll, greaser and rocker culture in the past setting of this film, but that's just my personal preference.There were many emotional scenes in this movie, the film gives me some thought provoking scenes which makes me think deeply about my parents and love life, but for the most part in an emotionally positive enthusiastic way, especially as this film has a happy ending for the most part. There's so many emotional scenes in this film that it's too much to briefly mention all of them but most of them are emotional scenes involving a son and his parent or parents so if you have a particularly interesting relationship with your parents you'll probably find these scenes more interesting and emotional than most people, generally speaking.Off the top of my head, I can't think of any dull boring scenes this movie had, all the scenes are good and therefore the film is good from start to finish, the consistency of this film is brilliant. The film has a relatively slow start, but the slow start was necessary for character development to a certain extent. Some of the scenes at the start such as the first scene where Marty just walks around in Doc's home for a little while and the clocks start ringing and Marty's short journey from Doc's to his school are some examples of scenes that do make the beginning of this film relatively slow and relatively boring compared to the later parts of the film, but even those two scenes I mentioned were still definitely watchable and reasonably good in their own right.The plot of this film is flawless and epic. The chemistry between father and son, mother and son and friendships in this film will make you very entertained, if you're a history nerd like I am the looks of the various vehicles, as well as the old fashioned skateboards and diners from the 1950's will give you some joy. How this film has a young teenage boy pretty much healing himself and his parents whilst protecting his parents from a dangerous bully known as Biff Tannen 30 years into the past is in my opinion a very interesting complex plot full of emotion, facts and simple bliss.The character line up in this film is far from the best character line up in a movie, but most of the greatness this film has in my eyes comes from the film's plot, not the characters; the quality of the characters don't quite stack up compared to the quality of the film's plot. But the character line up in this film is still way above an average film, the only dull characters in this movie were the ones that didn't get a lot of screen time such as Marty's siblings and Jennifer, I felt Jennifer was a very under developed simplistic character for a character that's supposed to be the main character's girlfriend and she seemed to be a rather stereotypical boring unoriginal Hollywood Female character with no unique character traits of her own.The main characters though, Marty, Doc, Biff and Marty's parents were all above average characters, but they're all far from characters that are genuinely complex, well developed and sublimely unique. This film cleverly relies on the epic plot of the movie to make it so entertaining without having much in the way of great characters so really the characters never needed to all be great for this film to work as the turns the plot takes in this film makes much of the plot very relatable to the average person and therefore interesting and thought provoking.",Plot Complexity

"Back to the Future Part II (1989) was green lighted after the success of the first film. The film follows the further adventures of Marty and Doc Brown. This film and the third installment were filmed back to back. However the complexity of the storyline turned off many of the fans of the original. But this is what I enjoyed about this movie. Instead of being the same old run-of-the-mill by the numbers sequel, the film makers decided to do something different and make this a brain twister film. The beauty of this movie is that you have to pay close attention to it.The film takes place right after the events of part one. Doc Brown comes back from the future to help Marty get his kid out of trouble. Instead of leaving well enough alone, all three of them head off to the future to try and change events. They managed to pull it off but unfortunately they tore a fabric in time due to Marty being greedy and the nosy efforts of Doc Brown. Can Doc and Marty safely restore the space and time continuum before the universe collapses upon itself?A fun sequel with a few cast changes (Elizabeth Shue now portrays Marty's girlfriend whilst Crispin Glover is no longer with in the film except in stock footage). Most of the original players return to reprise their original roles. Michael J. Fox stretches his acting abilities by playing his son and daughter as well as his older self.

"Continuing a movie as perfect as ""Back To The Future"" must have been a really tough job. What made it even harder was that the writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had to ignore an important character from part one. Because Crispin Glover asked for too much money, his character George McFly, Marty's wacky Dad, hardly appears in the sequels, which constricted the storyline a lot beforehand.Still, ""Back To The Future II"" turned out to be a huge success, commercially and artistically. The movie is every bit as clever and delightful as part one. I think most viewers don't realize how extremely complex this story is, because it's so enjoyable to watch. Gale & Zemeckis wrote a screenplay that takes place in three different periods of time, changes storyline more than once, has characters interacting with themselves all the time, but never seems overdone or confusing. The most original trick the two Bobs pulled was to virtually return to part one and have the main character interfere with the original storyline. I don't think that has ever been done before or since.No, the movie isn't flawless in a sense that everything can be explained logically. Bob Gale admitted himself that Marty and Doc shouldn't be able to visit their future selves in the first place. There are a lot of impossible time travels in part two (you can read about them in detail here: http://mjyoung.net/time/back2.html). ""Mistakes"" like that don't take away any of the fun, though, and I still think that the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy incorporates the logics of time traveling better than any other movie ever did.Besides the perfect script the trilogy's success is due to Zemeckis ever so beautiful direction and his eye for detail, and of course the great cast. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson, all shamelessly underrated actors, are once again brilliant. It's a REAL pity that Crispin Glover didn't return for the sequels, but as I've said before, Gale & Zemeckis did a great job writing their way around his memorable character. The only other actress that didn't come back was Claudia Wells, who played Jennifer in part one and was appropriately replaced by Elisabeth Shue here.Summing up, ""Back To The Future II"" is a more than worthy follow-up to one of the best movies of all time. In fact, I think it's the best sequel ever made, only rivaled by ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"". But that's a different story...",Plot Complexity

Gale & Zemeckis wrote a screenplay that takes place in three different periods of time, changes storyline more than once, has characters interacting with themselves all the time, but never seems overdone or confusing. The most original trick the two Bobs pulled was to virtually return to part one and have the main character interfere with the original storyline. I don't think that has ever been done before or since.No, the movie isn't flawless in a sense that everything can be explained logically. Bob Gale admitted himself that Marty and Doc shouldn't be able to visit their future selves in the first place. There are a lot of impossible time travels in part two (you can read about them in detail here: http://mjyoung.net/time/back2.html). ""Mistakes"" like that don't take away any of the fun, though, and I still think that the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy incorporates the logics of time traveling better than any other movie ever did.Besides the perfect script the trilogy's success is due to Zemeckis ever so beautiful direction and his eye for detail, and of course the great cast. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson, all shamelessly underrated actors, are once again brilliant. It's a REAL pity that Crispin Glover didn't return for the sequels, but as I've said before, Gale & Zemeckis did a great job writing their way around his memorable character. The only other actress that didn't come back was Claudia Wells, who played Jennifer in part one and was appropriately replaced by Elisabeth Shue here.Summing up, ""Back To The Future II"" is a more than worthy follow-up to one of the best movies of all time. In fact, I think it's the best sequel ever made, only rivaled by ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"". But that's a different story...",Sequel Comparisons
"Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car ""DeLorean"" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love ""Back to the Future"" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. Back to the Future Part II (1989)The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with ""DeLorean"" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II weird. This film get's 8 ""Back to the Future"" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore.",Character Relationships

"Marty McFly is back, and this time he has to travel back to 1955 after an unfortunate incident which took place in 2015 so that he can prevent the destruction of the peaceful society of Hill Valley (what a great fictional name!). The film provides two hours of absolutely wonderful and fun entertainment. Every paradox and logical problem of time-travel is explained very well in the film itself, and those that are left out are easily overlooked due to the creativeness of the rest of the film. Who cares that if Marty leaves 1985 in a time machine to 2015, there would be no Marty left in 1985 to grow to up into the 47 year old Marty in 2015? This movie is so much fun that things like this are gladly forgotten about in order to accept the huge amount of satisfaction delivered by the film. The Back To The Future trilogy is a perfect example of the need to be willing to abandon at least a tiny bit of logic in order to fully enjoy a movie. This suspension of disbelief is necessary for a person to be able to truly experience the effectiveness of all three Back To The Future films, and this experience truly is a great one. It is so rare that a film or a series of films comes along that is so well written and perfectly acted and directed as the Back To The Future movies are. Although I realize that another sequel would probably be disastrous to the credibility of the series as a whole, I have to admit that I have always been disappointed that they stopped at the third film. All three are so much fun that they leave you wishing that the story left room for a few more sequels.",Plot Complexity

"When Back to The Future was initially conceived, director and writer Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale had no idea how much notoriety it would eventually achieve, nor of the big box office records it would break.  They were happy just to see their project come to fruition. When they wrote the original film, the ending they had written was supposed to be the end of it. Because of it's success, however, and Hollywood being Hollywood, there had to be the inevitable sequels.  The problem was that with the original ending, they had painted themselves into a corner as to where they could go with the sequel.  What they finally came up with in Part II, is a film that is every bit as whimsical as the original, yet moves along at a pace that will leave you breathless. For part II the cast is pretty much intact from the original film.  The exceptions are Crispin Glover as George McFly has been replaced by Jeffrey Weisman and Claudia Wells has been replaced by Elizabeth Shue as Marty's girlfriend Jennifer.  George McFly's role in the sequel is more talked about by other characters than his actual on screen time, and Jennifer's time on screen is quick and brief also (although she has one great scene that takes place in the future)so neither casting change is of any consequence. The original film dealt with how Marty had threatened his own existence because of changes he had accidentally initiated in the year 1955.  For Part II, we learn what happens when the interference is of a much larger scale and consequence. As you recall, the original film ended with Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)whisking Marty (Michael J. Fox)and Jennifer away with him to the year 2015 to straighten out their kids.  For all his harping about messing with historical events, Doc is not above initiating a bit of interference himself.  In their attempt to rescue Marty's future offspring, an aged but still obnoxious Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), steals the Delorean to transport himself into the past and to bestow upon himself a Sports Almanac book that contains the results of sporting events for years to come.  Shortly thereafter, Doc and Marty return to 1985, only to find that not only is Hill Valley not what it used to be, their own lives are in pretty sad shape and far different than what they had been before.  And the changes aren't good ones, or as Doc puts it ""I can't imagine Hell being much worse."" What makes the Back To The Future series so terrific, is that Zemeckis and Gale took the time travel concept, applied a little originality to it, then let their imaginations run wild. In BTTFII, we get a story that moves along like a runaway freight train.  Not content to give us what the year 2015 may be truly like, since making such predictions are usually wrong anyway, they decide to let it all hang loose and just have fun with it.  There are holographic theaters, Cafe 80's shops, antique stores that sell dustbusters and other things, skateboards that hover, paying for cab rides with thumbprints, etc. etc.  Yet, for all the glossy, multi-colored stores and goofy concepts, we still recognize it as the same old Hill Valley. Something else Zemeckis and Gale do is to take some events from the first film, and replay them in 2015 Hill Valley.  Usually, things like this would be seen as the lack of an idea, but in this case its simply Zemeckis having a little fun and letting us in on it.  It works perfectly. Likewise, the alternative version of 1985 Hill Valley is an exercise in how far one's imagination can go.  Instead of a quaint peaceful town and suburbs, Zemeckis and Gale do everything in their power to give us the equivalent of an opposite. To go into too much detail here would undermine your own viewing experience and give away a bit too much of the plot. Then to add fuel to the fire, we once again revisit Hill Valley in 1955, where things really go berserk what with two Marty's and two Docs inhabiting the same year.  Zemeckis does a great job of cutting new scenes into footage from the original film with different angles and different perspectives of previous seen activities. As for the cast, Fox and Lloyd keep their characters of Marty and Doc on the same entertaining level as before.  Fox is also given the chore of playing his nerdy son of the future, Marty as a middle aged man and even his daughter of the future.  He is pretty much successful except I do think playing his daughter was a bit much.  Lea Thompson, again has the difficult chore of bringing Lorraine Mcfly to us in three different characterizations, and as before handles it admirably.  Her 1955 Lorraine will always be her most memorable characterization in these films, but the others are equally well done.  As for Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, Biff is biff, no matter how old, how young, or how powerful he may be, and his consistence of performance is also noteworthy. Some have complained about being able to follow Zemeckis and Gale's storyline.  If you have seen the first film, you'll have no trouble in that regard.  I sure didn't, and for me it was one heck of a comedic thrill ride from beginning to end.  If you don't have fun watching Back To The Part II, then the only thing I can think of is that your as much of a curmudgeon as old Biff from 2015.  It's not often that a sequel can live up to it's predecessor, but when it does, and introduces some originality along the way you get my grade, which for Back To The Future is an A.",Plot Complexity

For one thing, it's much more sci-fi-ish. The first movie took a sci-fi principle and built around it a movie whose charm was based on human interaction. The sequel is a bit more interested in it's sci-fi elements, and a little less interested in people.But the real problem is that this movie is much less well constructed than the original. In BTTF, everything is neatly set up. Everything that happens flows logically from a previous event. But BTTF2 is much more of a mishmosh, with a rambling story and loose threads. Even the way the movie begins is antithetical to the first one. The first time around, Doc is keenly aware of the dangers of fooling with history; in this movie, he chooses to change things around.It's also also just not nearly as funny as the first one.BTTF2 picks up towards the end. The last half hour or so has Marty returning to the scenes of the original movie, and it's cute to see the way he has to change events without letting the first time traveling Marty see him. It is in fact references to the first movie that are the best part of the second. Which just proves how good the first one was, and how idea- poor the sequel is.",Plot Complexity

"It's funny that the plot of 'Back to the Future II' should be based on altering Marty McFly's future. Wasn't Doc the one who was so staunchly opposed to knowing too much about their future, preferring instead to let things take a natural course? 'Destiny!' he called it. But that is exactly what the sequel is all about, Doc's proposal to altar the future. And this leads not only to bad news for Doc Brown and Marty, but for the your Density? I mean, Destiny? (flashback humor).The story focuses on Marty McFly's future. Picking up right where we left off in the first movie, Doc informs Marty that in the year 2015, Marty's son partakes in some unfortunate activities with Griff (Biff's grandson) that lead to his arrest and incarceration. While in the future to fix up that little mishap (again, messing with 'Destiny'), Marty picks up a sports Almanac to take back with him. The Almanac contains all sports scores since something like 1955 (why it is only the size of a magazine, I don't know, considering it covers major college and pro sporting event for a whole lot of years). The Doc, in disgust at Marty's foolish get-rich-quick desires, throws the magazine out (while still in 2015). Unfortunately, Biff, now an old man, gets hold of both the magazine and the Delorian and travels to his young self in 1955. This sets off a change of events in the past so that when Marty and the Doc, now in the future, are ready to go back to 1985, suddenly find themselves in an unfamiliar hell. With Biff changing the past, he also changed the future, creating a desolate, alternate 1985. One where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley, though still the sleaziest. And where a lot of other things have changed as well. Now, Marty and the Doc have to go back to 1955 and get the magazine from Biff if they expect to restore the future and erase the alternative 1985.This is a great sequel to a great movie. You get the 1989 version of the future (I don't know that 2015 will make the kind of progress we see in the movie with cool flying cars and dehydrating pizzas and hoverboards). This is the special effects and visual beauty of the second, whereas in the first one, it was recreating the past. Marty had to once adapt to 1955, now he has to do the same for 2015, even if only for a moment. But, it also ties in another creative aspect: when Marty and the Doc must return to 1955, they only know the whereabouts of Biff based on where they last saw him in that year--the school dance and all of that which took place in the first movie. Going back to that past means that a Marty ""Calvin Klein"" McFly is already there, and the events are taking place again just as we saw them in the first movie. And now, the Marty and the Doc from the future are intermingling once again with their past versions of themselves. So, in essence, the filmmakers had to recreate some of the scenes from the old movie, from different angles, and the actors had to play dual roles (which they do often throughout the trilogy) by being added into those scenes. It was a great special effects/visionary project to undertake, and what makes the series so damned creative and really a fun idea. And here, too, the goal is to avoid running into your past self because, yes, it could altar events once again. I wonder how the future changed since Marty and Doc's intervention in 2015? So, prepare yourself for what may arguably be the best movie out of the trilogy (probably because you get to see the future and past and everything in between; although, I'm still torn between rating the first or the second as my absolute favorite). It is the continuation of a fun first movie, and keeps up the creativity and novelty. I think that was the reason most responsible for its success: the ability to keep offering something new (although some things, are obviously repeated, like the running gag of Marty blacking out and waking up to some version of his mother informing him of what year it is after he tells her what an awful dream he had).So, sit back and let the Delorean be your guide.",Visual Effects
"It's funny that the plot of 'Back to the Future II' should be based on altering Marty McFly's future. Wasn't Doc the one who was so staunchly opposed to knowing too much about their future, preferring instead to let things take a natural course? 'Destiny!' he called it. But that is exactly what the sequel is all about, Doc's proposal to altar the future. And this leads not only to bad news for Doc Brown and Marty, but for the your Density? I mean, Destiny? (flashback humor).The story focuses on Marty McFly's future. Picking up right where we left off in the first movie, Doc informs Marty that in the year 2015, Marty's son partakes in some unfortunate activities with Griff (Biff's grandson) that lead to his arrest and incarceration. While in the future to fix up that little mishap (again, messing with 'Destiny'), Marty picks up a sports Almanac to take back with him. The Almanac contains all sports scores since something like 1955 (why it is only the size of a magazine, I don't know, considering it covers major college and pro sporting event for a whole lot of years). The Doc, in disgust at Marty's foolish get-rich-quick desires, throws the magazine out (while still in 2015). Unfortunately, Biff, now an old man, gets hold of both the magazine and the Delorian and travels to his young self in 1955.

"I am conflicted on this one. Naturally, it is the sequel to the most popular film of nineteen eighty-five, and one of my favorite films of all time, Back to the Future. They did not expect the film to become a hit, but when it did, the studio took no time telling them to make a sequel. And so we got this film. The creators have gone on record stating that the 'To Be Continued' at the end of movie one was not supposed to relate to anything, and that if they knew that they were going to be making a sequel, they would have ended it differently.The lack of desire to make this movie in particular shows. A lot. It is disjointed, filled with plot holes, pandering, and altogether does not work as a film that can be enjoyed completely seriously. I do like this film, but I like it in the same way that I like another ridiculous sequel to one of my favorite films of all time: Rocky IV. Both films are memorable and ingrained in the public consciousness, but decidedly not what a film critic would consider good.But why? What goes wrong here. Let's take a look at the plot. Marty McFly, the seventeen year-old icon of the 80s himself, goes with his girlfriend Jennifer (played by a different actress and sorely underused in this film) and crazy but awesome (seriously, the man made a time machine) scientist, Doc Brown to the future. What's the year, you may ask if you were living under a rock about a month and a half ago. 2015.I could go into how this movie's description of 2015 compares with the real 2015, but I went into that specifically on a post on my website that I wrote on BTTF Day. Suffice it to say that it is pretty cool in the retro future kind of way, the same way that steampunk and cyberpunk is cool. This is, strangely enough, the weakest section of the movie by far. There are some funny gags, but everything else falls flat.The second third takes us to an alternate 1985. I won't spoil anything (though if you haven't seen this film... shame on you), but suffice it to say that things are not pretty. It lacks the grand dystopian vision of something like Blade Runner, but there is a texture to the atmosphere that I really appreciate. And... I prefer to not get too political, but can we all just agree that the terrifying Alt1985 Biff is Donald Trump.The last third takes us back to 1955. This is both the worse and the best part of the movie. There are a lot of rehash gags here, and it comes dangerously close to completely retreading the plot of movie 1, and it drags on way too long, but the tension is thicker than in any other part, and the last fifteen minutes of the film is one of, if not the best sections of any of these films.There are a lot of parts that are just lame, plain and simple. But I don't feel embarrassment but disappointment. Of all the movies, this one covers the most ground, has the most ambition and imagination, and overall material to make a great film. But whereas the first one did everything right, this film squanders a lot of opportunities. The magic is gone. I wish I could say that it's a great film, but it's just an average one, and my least favorite of the BTTF trilogy.(Still, it is pretty cool how they were able to throw in a couple references to BTTF 3 due to shooting both sequels at the same time.)",Plot Complexity

"Warning: unpopular opinion alert. Having just watched the sequel to the brilliantly energetic Back to the Future for the first time, whilst having a moment of reflection as I imagine myself riding a hoverboard with a pair of Nike MAGs equipped, I arrived at my conclusive destination. No time travelling back and forth between alternate timelines needed. And as much as you probably do not want to hear this, honesty is the best policy. With that, I can confidently confess that Back to the Future Part II is aggressively average. A sequel riddled in so much mediocrity, that I'm dumbfounded as to how it has received such unanimous praise from audiences. Immediately after the events from its predecessor, Doc and Marty travel to the future to prevent his son from sabotaging their family's future.However in doing so, future Biff uses Doc's time machine for his own devious benefit and timelines become more skewed than Glover's non-existent involvement (glad he won the lawsuit). Gale returns as the primary writer, and in the short space of time between this sequel and the original, he had seemingly forgotten how to write a decent character driven plot. The story is solely focused on the mechanisms of time travel, by dabbling into several different points in time, that Gale outwardly throws in as many paradoxical plot points as possible. The present, the future, the past, an alternate present. So much story was crammed into the plot, that he had inadvertently relinquished the heartwarming emotional family drama that made the original tantalisingly refreshing.Literally, take the first hour of this film and use it as fusion energy. It's a complete re-hash. Copying the same events from 1955 and adapting them to futuristic technologies found in this now awkward dystopian 2015 (if only we had flying cars...), may generate callback humour. But consequently makes the entire set piece monotonously dull. Zip back to 1955, adjacent to the previous film's timeline, and again it's just an identical narrative structure. This time substituting the emotional core resonance between Marty's mother and father for a simplistic yet elongated chase sequence for a sports almanac. This would be all swell if Zemeckis could actually focus on one sub-plot at a time. The constant shifting between present Marty chasing Biff whilst avoiding past Marty and past parents, Doc floating around aimlessly in the DeLorean and Jennifer...wait, what even happened to her? Talk about discarding the one and only female character almost immediately!Essentially, the pacing was diabolically uneven. The only hint of originality was with the alternate present timeline and that whole sequence was instantly forgettable. Had it been more emotionally impactful on Marty, then perhaps I would think differently. Unfortunately he shrugs it off and consistently yells ""Doc!"" whenever he has a minute not chasing someone.Atleast Gale remedied my existing criticism with the first film by giving Biff some much needed character development. His antagonistic motives actually provided sufficient fuel for Doc and Marty. Lloyd offered another perfect performance as Doc, and Fox was slightly more underwhelming than his previous iteration, but that's down to the robotic script which provided more opportunities for visual spectacle. And yes, the visuals still hold up well today (minus Glover not Glover floating upside down...). But to waste a total of five minutes by replicating the ending to the original (shot-for-shot) and spewing a teaser trailer for Part III, was futile.In all seriousness, I'm shrouded in disappointment. From all the ""woops"" and ""cheers"" that this trilogy has received over time, I would've anticipated a solid sequel. Alas, the uneven overstuffed plot slowed the pace down to a staggeringly moderate 30mph, not nearly enough motivation for me to travel back in time and watch this again in a hurry.",Plot Complexity

"Back to the Future Part II' takes off where the first movie left. Pretty much the essence of the first one is present except this time Elisabeth Shue has been cast as Marty's girlfriend. Like the first movie, this one too is non-stop fun. The original plot once again, brilliantly revolves around the time-travelling paradox but this time the interference with the time-line has huger repercussions that are more complicated to solve. It's slightly a little more complex than the first movie but the energy and entertainment level is the same. I liked Zemeckis's version of 2015.

Like the first movie, this one too is non-stop fun. The original plot once again, brilliantly revolves around the time-travelling paradox but this time the interference with the time-line has huger repercussions that are more complicated to solve.

"I love the original movie, so don't get me wrong, but I have a special thing for really cool looking futuristic things. Especially if they're made out to look really interesting like in this sequel.The story is still very good, the characters are still lovable and have some great lines, and the ending is superb even if it leaves you wanting for a little more. Interchanging between this movie and the last (even the next) were great twists and turns, probably still the best achievement i've seen properly executed in a film to date.While the original is probably an eleven on my scale now, this one used to be my all time favorite one in the BTTF trilogy. And there's still a whole lot to love about this movie, even the kids today will probably appreciate how much fun this movie is even with all the flash and more advanced CG effects they have in their movies today.",Plot Complexity

"Picking up where the first one left off, Doc takes Marty for an adventure as they travel to the future 2015 as they take care some business; while that is going on, Marty's nemesis Biff steals the time machine by giving the sports almanac that Marty bought to his younger self as he creates an alternate dimension. So its up to Doc and Marty to stop Biff for letting this all happening as they try to fix time. The year is finally 2015, and the 2015 we have today is nothing like what the movie looked. Of course, I have look up many news and videos as they try to create shoes that laces themselves, and creating hover-boards that float. No the Cubs did not win the World Series, but we came so close to make that predictability a reality. So anyway, ""Back to the Future Part II"" is a fun sequel to watch, but not as good as the first. I thought Michael J. Fox, and Christopher Lloyd are still great together, while Lea Thompson and the rest of the cast all did great. Of course, I have to mention Thomas F. Wilson who is really good for playing a bad guy like the character he played in all three movies. The look of 2015 is really well done, which it doesn't go into the same style like what ""Blade Runner"" looked. The movie does have its exciting moments, and you are always rooting for Marty and Doc as they try to save time. The special effects by ILM are really good, while some seem slightly dated. The movie is also funny too, so nothing much that I can say about. Alan Silvestri's music is also really good too along side with the story. I do wish if the opening scene wasn't re-shot, but Claudia Wells was unable to due to what is happening with her family; its understandable but can't complain about that. However, I do wish if Crispin Glover was in this movie but he ends up not to due to what his reasons were as he needed more money, and not appreciating how the first one ended. I do disagree with his thoughts on the ending, and I still wish if he was in this movie. So with that said, I enjoy ""Back to Future Part II,"" and I am sure that you will have a fun time with this one. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",Visual Effects

"Back to the Future 2 is a brilliant sequel, for its incredible futuristic special effects made this film into a Classic Time Travel movie. There was a period, however, when the entire film went stagnant and downhill, but did pick-up again as the film went on. Up until the part when Marty McFly(Micheal J. Fox) returned to the alternate(Biff ruled) 1985 for when Marty got hit over the head by Biffs goons infront of the Clocktower/Biffs Casino Hotel this film was spectacular, but thereafter that scene, this film endlessly dragged-on.In time this film did pick-up again when Marty McFly went back in time to the year 1955 to retrieve the Sports Almanac that Old Biff gave to young Biff, for that spiced up the film again. Even though I very much enjoyed this film, I did find that there were loads of contradictions in it that didn't make sense. The scene when Old Biff travelled back in time from the year 2015 to the year 1955 to give the Sports Almanac to himself (so he can win money on horse racing by knowing the winning results ahead of time) and then returned to the year 2015 didn't quite match up. This is because when Old Biff travelled back in time to the year 1955 giving himself(Young Biff) the Sports Almanac so he could become rich, he did in fact change history. This means that when he returned to the year 2015 it should have been the new alternate(Biff ruled) 2015, but it wasn't, for it was the same normal 2015 that he departed from.Another scene is when Marty and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) went back home to the year 1985 after fixing Martys family problems in the year 2015, didn't make proper sense either because seeing how old Biff changed history, that prevented Marty and Doc Brown from ever meeting one another and even Doc Brown from inventing the Time machine. This doesn't match up either - for this would have caused a time travel paradox that Doc Brown often speaks about, which would have ceased their existences to time as they knew it, and their souls would have been redeemed into the new alternate(1985) existences, for Marty would have become the new Marty that lives in a boarding school in Switzerland and Doc Brown would have been redeemed into the life of the alternate existence of being committed into a mental Institution, but it didn't happen that way. Instead, there were two Doc Browns and two Marty McFlys living in the same year and from different parallel universes/ time vessels - and many other examples of contradiction that just go on and on. Mind you, this film is a Comedy/Sci-fi and seeing as time travel is a fantasy subject, a person really can't take these contradictions seriously, for this film 'Back to the Future/ Part 2'(and other time travel movies) are about enjoying yourself and having a laugh. Despite this films contradictions which aren't a big deal anyway, i'd recommend anybody to watch this movie for the acting was good, especially Thomas Wilson(Biff/Griff Tannen) who performed a fantastic acting job, the special effects/background was amazing along with its great lighting and colour co-ordination and most of all the storyline was good. However, this film didn't have the most original storyline as this films storyline was copied from the film 'Its a wonderful life' but don't let that put you off watching the film 'Back to the future/Part 2' for the film 'Its a wonderful life' was a beautiful movie with a great storyline with a great plot and moral.",Plot Complexity

Story continues exactly from part 1 and has Marty and Doc going 30 years into the future to find that there is a new generation of McFly's but it gets complicated after that (and even more than the first).

The idea is no longer new, the characters are still the same and they do the same actions. As a result, all this looks with a sense of old living.

"Back to the Future Part II is a terrific sequel - it may not be the best ever made, but its certainly a novel approach and a great deal of fun. There's a lot going on in this film as we visit three time periods - future, alternate present and past again - and as a result its hard to pin down a single story like in the first or third films. The future storyline struggles to find purpose given Doc's repeated insistence that the future must not be meddled with. That being said its essential for the movie and its so much fun to watch 2015, both as a prediction over the last 30 years and as a bit of humour from now on. Its startling how accurate some things are - Skype, 3D films - while others are a great source of humour. I never realised until this watching that both Marty's son AND daughter are played by Fox. Production design does a great job being funny whilst also conceivable, but the film's makeup is absolutely appalling. If you're going to make Lea Thompson put on that stupid voice and cake her under 100 feet of makeup, just get a different actress. Michael J. Fox as future Marty looks like Bride of Chucky. A man comes up to Marty to ask to save the clock tower and he's clearly caked in makeup, but why? He's no recognisable character after all, they could've just got any old man. Thomas Wilson plays the utterly unbearable Griff, who feels the need to shriek every word like a mental werewolf android. Not a whole lot goes on here and we quickly get out so that the film can set up the dystopian alternate reality.In alternate 1985, Biff has stolen the DeLorean and made himself rich. This is the best plot line that Gale could ever have come up with, because who among us hasn't wished we could do that? Rick Carter and his team create a twisted and brilliant dystopian 1985, and Thomas F. Wilson is exceptional as the evil billionaire Biff. Doc quickly figures out what happened and explains to the audience in a way that is not overly expository because thanks to Lloyd's consistently wacky performance, it is actually a fun scene to watch. Finally we get back to 1955 where the film plays out. Marty and Doc need to get back everything while not tampering with the past AND avoiding their selves from the first movie. This is by far the best part of this movie. Zemeckis blows my mind when constructing scenes that have two Michael J. Foxs noticeably on screen, because it doesn't for a moment look like they've done it with cheap effects. Zemeckis creates an aura of crises by constantly throwing obstacles into Marty's way, so you'll watch Marty's quest for the Almanac on the edge of your seat. The film finishes with one of the most famous cliffhangers and utterly delightful conclusions I've ever seen. Michael J. Fox is older and a bit less enthusiastic about being this wacky kid again, but Marty is such a lovable character that it doesn't matter too much. I always get cheap entertainment out of the whole ""are you chicken"" thing with McFly that was introduced in this film, but objectively its stupid. Lloyd is just as good as in the first film, every bit the wacky mad scientist in his voice, demeanour and even posture. Elisabeth Shue is irrelevant as Jennifer, who is included in the film because Gale and Zemeckis made the mistake of taking her with them at the end of the first, but Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as the various Biffs throughout time. Not many people could play a character as a teen, a tycoon and an old codger with equal conviction.Back to the Future 2 has lots of omages to classic scenes in the first, but none of them feel forced or tacky - there's something delightful about watching Marty flee on a hoverboard instead of a skateboard. Its a great and worthy sequel and a heap of fun to watch.",Plot Complexity

"This was the only one of the three ""Back To The Future"" movies I did not enjoy watching, even when I loved the other two (which I don't particularly now).The reason this film wasn't fun to be was that the annoying bully, ""Biff"", played effectively by Thomas Wilson, had a much bigger role than he did in the other ones. This guy was so annoying, he ruined the story for me. They even had him (the same actor, too) playing his son ""Griff"" in the future. Thanks to him, this BTTF Part 2 had a mean edge to it. I wanted an adventure-comedy, not a nasty movie. There was too much emphasis on this villain instead of the lighthearted fantasy that made the first movie such a hit. The writers much have realized this dark formula didn't work as they went back to form for the third in this series, making it a lot funnier and fun to watch.

"I loved the first Back to the Future, it was fun, original and simply irresistible. Back to the Future 2 is a very good sequel, while considered the darkest of the three it is still quite bright in tone. It isn't as good as the first film though, moving a little too fast and a little too much crammed in such as the past, future and alternative universes idea.

"Ah Back to the Future. What a timeless classic that film was back in the 80's. It broke new grounds in time travel as a sub-genre in sci-fi movies of the 80's. But how about we experience it again? Sounded great and ludicrous at the same time. The original ended on a cliff-hanger and fans were expecting another Zemeckis masterpiece! Did they get it? ABSOLUTELY!!! I will go far as to say its even better than the original! How did it manage to do that? Well it utilizes the time-travel concept in the story very well and it tied together perfectly. Great job Zemeckis for that phenomenal directing! When people first saw it they thought it was gonna be an impossible feat for the film to match and to exceed the original! But it did! Enough of the history lets get down to brass tax! Back to the Future Part II is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Back to the Future. Doc takes Marty and Jennifer(Elizabeth Shue) to 2015 to save their son's future! Meanwhile, in 2015, Marty decides to get a hold of a sports almanac and use time travel as a means of making money. Hmm... a wanna-be billionaire? Isn't that what we wanna be now-a-days? Anyway, Biff gets a hold of the almanac and goes back to 1955 and all hell breaks loose in the time lines. What makes this work is that every scene is cohesively done well and is perfectly paced! Michael J. Fox gives a great performance as Marty as always from Fox. Doc Brown is still fantastic as the mad scientist Doc Brown and my favorite character Biff is just as mean and hilarious as ever! Biff is absolutely freaking hilarious in this movie and has the most funniest quotes I have ever heard in movie history! ""Hey butt head!"" ""Why don't you make like a tree and get out of here!"" OH SO FUNNY XDXDXD Now what did I appreciate in this movie? I love the fact that every scene flows well in this series of events happening in different time periods. I loved the way they fit Old Mcfly with Young Mcfly in the future! Great filmmaking at its finest! I loved all the characters(mainly Biff). Lasy but not least I love the performances and memorable quotes in this movie! It has a certain charm to me that causes to like it every time I watch it! Plus, the special effects were fantastic and the costumes and set work were really good in depicting the future and the past! However, one minor thing that went under my skin was when they repeated the quote ""Chicken"" all the time. But, its not something that breaks the movie it just was a little annoying. But all in all it is a fantastic sequel to already an incredible movie and exceeds the original ten-fold! So get your Delorean to 88 mph and get ready for another awesome ride!!!",Character Relationships

"""Back to the Future Part II"" embarks on yet another exhilarating time travel adventure with Marty McFly and Doc Brown as they dart into 2015, attempting to prevent future calamities for the McFly family. While this sequel thrives on inventive futuristic visions, complete with hoverboards and self-lacing shoes, it leans into a more convoluted plot line that may not capture the same heartfelt nostalgia as its predecessor. The film's strength lies in its audacious depiction of the future and its complex narrative that intertwines multiple timelines, showcasing the filmmakers' creativity. However, the film occasionally succumbs to over-dramatization, particularly towards the end. The showdown involving Biff and the almanac, though crucial to the plot, feels somewhat stretched and overly theatrical, detracting from the core emotional engagement of the story. Despite these criticisms, ""Back to the Future Part II"" is undeniably a fun and worthy continuation of the series. Its bold take on the future and the continuation of beloved character arcs provide a satisfying, if somewhat bumpy, ride. For fans of the first film, watching the sequel is recommended as part of the trilogy's broader narrative arc, although it might not stand alone with the same impact. While it doesn't quite recapture the charm of the original, it still holds its ground as an entertaining piece of cinematic history.",Plot Complexity
"Have to watch the films together! I watched some of the second film seperatly from the first. Ouch, not good! The 3 film is a series similar to the Sopranos. Recently watching the first film, and then catching the second film on TBS the viewer notices many jokes, hidden meanings which were missed when not viewing the movies recently together. The center theme of the script is the time line conitinuum. If broken, the result could be disastrous. 3 parts of the film I notice is that Michael J Fox wears the same clothes, uses the same expressions etc because it is the 1985 Marty. Genetics and history repeats itself is another inside joke in all three films. A polarity with time travel theme. As history repeats itself the same people do the same things, but a little differently. Biff, is the usually unhappy jerk, who is selfish, and believes everyone owes him. If Biff is not happy, then no one is. This movie is a great set up for what will happen in the third. One can watch ones self, but not interfere, and at the same time learn via the third person. In, second viewing I give this film a 7 out of 10. I wish we all could watch ourselves in the third person.",Plot Complexity

"Back To The Future Part II (1989)' picks up from its predecessor's purposefully over-the-top cliffhanger and runs straight for the finish, weaving a complex web of potential paradoxes, suspenseful set-pieces and ahead-of-their-time special effects with nothing other than absolute aplomb. Of course, it isn't as good as the first film; nothing is (almost literally). Still, the thing is an absolutely solid sequel that's far, far better than it really has any right to be. There are two things it perhaps does better than its big brother: pacing and VFX. The story starts after mere moments and doesn't let up for a second, keeping you hooked until it reaches its own incredibly iconic cliffhanger ending. The most prominent special effect is an utterly seamless 'acting opposite yourself' sort of thing, which still puts similar efforts to shame. Though the movie is known as ""the one where they go to the future"", it doesn't really get going until it dives into a deliciously devilish alternate 1985. Here, the time-continuum conundrums really start to begin and they are an absolute blast. It's probably closer to what you think of as a time-travel narrative than the more one-off, 'what-if?' story of the first. A lot of that is because this is pretty much the pioneer of most tropes associated with the genre. It's all incredibly well-conceived. For every line of near ham-fisted fan service, the flick gracefully pulls off a beautiful bit of foreshadowing or drops your jaw with a self-eating snake scenario. It's never indulgent, yet knows exactly what it needs to be. It's thoroughly enjoyable and is easily among the best sequels of all time. 10/10",Plot Complexity

"Trilogies are quite peculiar when viewed in retrospect. Especially when, as is the case for ""Back to the Future Part II"", the storyline is planned out ahead of time for multiple installments. After the success of the outstanding and genre-defining original, director Robert Zemekis sought to complete the story of Marty McFly with a two-part finale that would seamlessly follow on where the original ended. Zemekis, producer Steven Spielberg and writer Bob Gale in essence attempted to produce a singular cohesive story that would unfold over the course of three chapters... one big five-and-a-half- hour movie.The inherent problem with this clever but mildly flawed tactic is the fact that it can make the individual films a bit less digestible when viewed on their own. Sure, the original is stand-alone enough that it can be enjoyed as a complete experience. But you can't really watch the second or third chapters as individual films... they're too episodic and reliant on one-another. Thankfully, though, the sense of fun urgency and the likable characters still shine through, and make the second part of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy a worthy and worthwhile watch. Even if it is a bit too self- indulgent and convoluted at times.Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are forced to travel throughout time once again in order correct an error made by Marty's children in the distant future of 2015. However, in a moment of greed, Marty inadvertently triggers a change in his own present time of 1985 and destroys the lives of all he loves- with his father's old nemesis Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) now in charge of Hill Valley and his father murdered. And so, Doc and Marty must once again attempt to save the present by fixing their mistakes on a journey that will take them to the past, the future and beyond!I think the key issue I have with the film is that of the three installments, ""Part II"" is by far the most needlessly complex and overstuffed entry, with contrivances and convenience taking charge a bit too often. Things just sort-of happen to manufacture tension and drama, even when they feel tacked on and sometimes superfluous. It's not enough for Marty and Doc to travel to the future for a new adventure... they need to travel to the future, then travel to the present, then travel to the past in order to fix mistakes that they themselves caused and easily could have prevented. It all feels a bit too disjointed and random. It does succeed in some playful and eye- popping world building, but its the result of a self-indulgent and shaky story as Zemekis and Gale pile on weirdness and wackiness simply for the sake of weirdness and wackiness. It's not as refined or cohesive as the original, nor is it as straight-forward and rewarding as the final chapter.Thankfully, despite my admittedly huge problem with the structure and the narrative, the film still satisfies on the whole thanks to the electrifying and endlessly likable cast and the imagination and entertainment value that Zemekis specializes in. There's a reason that Marty McFly and Doc Brown have become such beloved and recognized heroes in the annals of popular culture. And the absolutely pitch-perfect performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are a big part of this. Both light up the screen and compliment each other well, building off of the original and continuing to prove their remarkable chemistry with one another. They really are one of the finest teams in cinematic history. It's also a ton of fun seeing Thomas F. Wilson continue to deliver as that deliciously evil bully Biff, and supporting roles by the likes of Elizabeth Shue are very well cast. Yes, it's a shame there were some shakeups behind the scenes, and the eccentric Crispin Glover is definitely missed. But on the whole? Great jobs from all involved!And this movie is another prime example of director Robert Zemekis' wild eye for sharp and inspired visual storytelling and his playful sense of tone. The film might suffer for its shaky writing, but it makes up for it with a plethora of high-energy set-pieces and ends up a non-stop visual feast for the eyes. Each timeline presented feels ""real"" in that delightfully ""hyper-real"" way that only Hollywood can deliver, and it's a lot of fun seeing how Zemekis breathes life to different eras. His action is flowing and kinetic without relying on cheap tricks or deceptive editing, and some of the chases and fights still take your breath away all these years later. And the film delivers one of the most mind-bending sequences in movie history with a climactic scuffle that blends different eras of time in a wickedly clever manner as past and future meet once again. Suffice to say and without spoiling anything... it'll change the way you see the original!As it stands, it's hard not to admit that ""Back to the Future Part II"" is the weakest of the iconic and beloved trilogy. It's wonky and contrived and feels very much like it was written on the fly. But that doesn't make it a bad film. And in fact, it's still pretty good. The cast is as delightful and lovable as always and the story is filled to burst with clever sequences and exciting action set- pieces. And it definitely leaves you hungry for more! I give ""Back to the Future Part II"" a very decent 7 out of 10. It might be the weakest of the series, but it's still well worth checking out!",Character Relationships
"Way back in '89, I took the back-lot tour around Universal Studios in LA, during which I spied several futuristic looking vehicles from the upcoming sequel to Back To The Future; to say I was excited would be an understatement.

The answer: you can't (11/10 doesn't make much sense, does it?)���but you can MATCH it in terms of entertainment value, which is precisely what director Robert Zemeckis and Co. succeed in doing.With many of the original movie's cast reprising their roles (sadly no Crispin Glover or Claudia Wells, but Elisabeth Shue as the replacement Jennifer is more than welcome in my books), awesome special effects from ILM (even today, the hover boards and flying cars look great), a wonderfully inventive plot that'll leave you scratching your head trying to figure out the paradoxical possibilities, and loads of clever visual jokes, Back To The Future Part II is brilliant stuff from start to finish���and that's not even taking into account the added unintentional fun that can be had from the inaccuracy of the film's predictions for the future (unless technology advances a lot in the next five years, I doubt we'll be seeing auto-drying jackets by 2015).",Sequel Comparisons

"Very good, but very uneven; Part II is both the campiest and the darkest installment in the series. More specifically - the scenes taking place in 2015 have aged badly, and though they have some strokes of genius, they feel strained and rely far too heavily on cheap make-up effects, Michael J. Fox doing a mediocre job at playing Marty McFly's entire family a-la Eddie Murphy (not a pleasant comparison, I know). On the other hand, the scenes in the alternative 1985 are wonderfully dark and edgy compared to the first film, and all the scenes in 1955 - especially the ones made to correspond to parallel ones from the original - are brilliant. The unsatisfying ending doesn't help the fact the it feels a bit like a tweener, but it still stands as one of the most solid sequels ever made, and holds the first and third movies together well.",Sequel Comparisons
"Back to the future part two is a pretty good sequel, but it is unique in a few ways.

However upon returning they see that the fabric of time has been altered and now Biff is all powerful. So Marty and Doc must find out what went wrong and correct it.This film does a good job of picking up where the last one left off, however with a different actress as Jennifer this time. A lot happens in this film and it never drags ever in the whole film which is pretty cool. It is kind of like how The Empire Strikes Back has a lot happening in it,this film has that as well.Marty and Doc both are great again. The major character who gets more development in this film is Biff, and surprisingly he is a pretty funny character. I love the part where old Biff talks with younger Biff.This film is by far the most confusing of all three of the Back to the Future films. All of the time traveling is cool, but with so much going on and people almost running into themselves from other times it makes the film very unrealistic.This film is unique in that the last third of the film takes place within the first film. I can not think of any other film that does this. So I think that it is mandatory that you see the first film before you see this one.I think this is a great sequel to the first back to the future.

"Seconds after being left back in 1985, Doc Brown returns in his Deorean and whisks Marty and Jennifer off to the future (2015). Drugging Jennifer for her own protection, Doc tells Marty that he must stand in for his own kid, stand up to Biff's son and thus avert a change of events that would eventually destroy his family. The mission is accomplished fairly easily but both Marty and Jennifer discover their future, and neither likes what they see. Marty tries to smuggle a sports almanac back in time to make money betting. Doc stops him of course but Biff senior overhears and pieces it all together. Returning to 1985, Marty discovers that the present is totally changed, meanwhile Doc works out how it all occurred and sets out to put it right.For all the criticisms of summer ""event"" pictures, it is hard to complain too much about the sheer pleasure that the Back to the Future trilogy gives. Starting where the last film ended, this picks up really well in regards mood and humour. The plot is pretty clever and superficially the complex time-travelling stuff holds up really well and is effortlessly accessible. Of course if you want to tear cosmic holes in it then it can be done but to do so would be like kicking a kitten. Using the plot from the first film to good effect the best thing the sequel retains is the original's sense of fun because it is entertaining and has good pace. One criticism of it would be that, instead of the actual plots used in parts 1 and 3, this has a lot of time jumping instead. That this works means that it isn't too bad that it is a bit overused but it is still a niggle nonetheless.The cast are as good as before and the main ones all buy into the sense of fun required to make it work. Fox shows why he was a big draw when he was younger and is the real heart of the film. He just about holds his own alongside scene-stealing Lloyd. Thompson is pretty good and Shue has more to do but from the support cast the dominant performance comes from Wilson, who is basic but does it very well. The effects are impressive for the time although watching it now you will have to forgive the very obvious split-screen technique when actors are playing different versions of the same character at the same time.It is the weakest of the three films but that is not really a major criticism in this film series because they are all consistently enjoyable. The narrative rides the time-travelling gimmick for all its worth but it just about makes it all work. A fun film in a fun trilogy that the majority of viewers will easily enjoy.",Visual Effects
"Back to the Future Part 2, directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, produced by Steven Spielberg & Bob Gale, again, created an enjoyable sequel, while still trying to keep expanding boundaries, but may have gone too over the top, flooding the story with subplots, and too much going on. They incorporated, current present, future, new present & past, making the narrative uneven, with a lot of tone shifts.Michael J. Fox puts on another great performance, with his character being more than occupied. Marty is more matured this time around, other than his hilarious, unexplained anger issues. Doc is the same ol' doc, being energetic, yet super witty, just not getting enough screen time he deserves. We also got another dose of Thomas F. Wilson as Biff. Biff was all over this film, being just as active as Marty, and maybe even more than Doc. Even though his character isn't the most creative, he is a very talented actor, being able to play all these roles, in one film, and staying consistent.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale again, brought the same witty, and humorous dialogue, while incorporating a few familiar lines.The production design by Rick Carter was beautifully displayed. Carter had a lot on his plate, to perfect all these unique settings, and he completed the task with flying colors. The special effects were heavily relied on in this film, but were done very well.Overall, Back to the Future Part 2, may not have been the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it was still loads of fun, expanding on this creative premise, and fun-filled characters!",Visual Effects
"Back to the Future was one of a kind. It was written that way; exceptional attention was paid to detail, and it paid off. Zemeckis had a hit on his hands, and movie audiences swooned: Michael J. Fox at the pinnacle of his acting career paired with a high budget, fantastic script, there was no way the original could fail. Sequels, unless planned, are fated to surpass the bar set by the original story. When the secondary and tertiary scripts are not planned at the same time, the result is cotton candy fare that leaves you feeling empty, like this movie does.Sadly, the sequel(s) reflect the need for Hollywood suits to capitalize on an excellent idea. Instead of inventing truly original second and third scripts where none was originally intended, this and the third film were called for to fill the bank accounts of those involved. Although there are moments when BTTF II shines - such as the splicing of original material with old, bringing back scenes from the beloved original, there is so much kitsch and poor acting, even from the principals, that it's hard to swallow.Michael is Michael, Marty is Marty. Chrisopher Lloyd is Christopher Lloyd, Doc is Doc, and that's about it. Oh yeah, let's not forget old Einstein. The rest of the cast, while mostly returning, could have been forgotten. Michael J. Fox as his son AND daughter? Please. Lea Thompson struggles with multiple identities... the characters are so far beyond belief that it's painful. Where the original film almost made time travel seem plausible (albeit in a goofy way) the sequels make a parody of the original script and seem more like an insult. The budget covers makeup and some fantastic ideas, but it can't cover up the forced feeling that this film and its successor share. Slick effects and obvious humor can't save sequels, but the need to capitalize on a successful franchise overrides originality. Everything about this movie seems clich��d instead of daring. Some actors define their careers by being involved in quality productions; in this film time the cast shows their need to finance a yacht payment.If you can suspend all need for believability, this flick might get it done. But it won't work without the third installment, and for once in my life I have to give credit to Crispin Glover: he may be a freak, but he's an honest freak, and he stayed away from the scripts for a reason. I'd recommend that you do too. Watch the first installment as intended: a standalone production, and find better fare if you need to watch a movie instead of the the poor sequels.",Sequel Comparisons
"This picks up right from where the first one ends. Marty, Doc and Jennifer goes to the future to help save his children in 2015. Only things go completely off the tracks when Biff in the future steals the DeLorean to change the past for his benefit.The time travel in this movie is even more complicated. It revisits the 1955 timeline actually make it work better. The scenes where he revisits the same time as the original is truly inventive. The great thing is that it combines with the original to make the whole series even better. It's seamless integration is what makes this sequel superior to any other sequels. It's a work of mathematical genius from Robert Zemeckis.",Sequel Comparisons
"Back to the Future was never intended to have a sequel but after its huge success they not only filmed a sequel but a third film as well, filmed back to back on a $40 million budget. The film gained $332 million worldwide making it the third highest grossing film of 1989. Part II is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, reprising their roles of Dr. Emmet Brown and Marty McFly.A lot of people say that this film is their favourite in the series but in my opinion, this is my least favourite. To me, part II just doesn't have the same charm I and III has, not only that but the story is very uneven and unnecessarily jumbled, so much so they have to spoon feed you information so people who don't have a clue what's going on can better understand and as someone who did know what was happening it felt irritating.That doesn't mean there isn't anything good about this film, in fact I just listed all the problems I had with this film, so everything else after this is just positives. We again have a fantastic cast playing great characters, with all the time travel and alternate time lines we get to see a fairly wide range from the actors. The humour is spot on with plenty of reason to laugh.The interpretation of the future was also really interesting, of course we now know it's wrong because it's the past now but it was great to see how accurate it was, and with how unique and different it was from many other interpretations of the future it was great to look at. The costume and set design was brilliant and looked fantastic on screen. The visuals of this film was perhaps one of its strongest parts, from 2015 to alternate 1985 everything looked amazing, the special effects were also well done by the always great industrial light and magic. All intertwined with the once again excellent Alan Silvestri score which, while not as memorable as the first, is still fantastic and suits the film well, building atmosphere and tension.While on the note of visuals, we saw a return of some of the great visual comedy which spiced up the humour from the first film, we also see the return of a lot of shots used in the first film which does tie them together.Overall Back to the Future is a great exciting film with the actors getting a lot of chance to shine. Although messy it's still a lot of fun with hilarious and edge-of-your-seat moments all accompanied by a fantastic score.",Visual Effects

"You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all. Of course you will laugh at the depiction of 2015 in the second chapter.",Visual Effects

"I was a little apprehensive about this film. How could it possibly stand up to the first Back to the Future movie. But Back to the Future Part II is every bit as good as the first one and takes the franchise further. It begins where the previous film left off, with Marty (Michael J. Fox), Doc (Christopher Lloyd) and Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) traveling to 2015. There we meet Marty's future family and Old Biff and his grandson (both played by Thomas F. Wilson) and see many futuristic gadgets. However, by a curious turn of events, Marty and Doc have to travel back to 1955, the same year Marty traveled to the previous day, in the first movie.The plot of this film is more complicated than the first one, with multiple time-lines in the past, present and the future. There are multiple Martys, Docs, Jennifers and Biffs at a given time. As you can see, it explores the consequences of time-travel in greater detail. But it is never confusing and as light-hearted as the first movie. It has a lot of good, intelligent comedy. It is nice to see all our favorite characters from the first movie. All the cast, with the exception of Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells, have returned, with some of them playing multiple roles. This is one sequel which I am glad they made.",Sequel Comparisons
"Back to the Future Part II is not as good as the original, especially compared to legendary sequels like Aliens (1986), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Spider-Man 2 (2004), and The Dark Knight (2008).However, the film is still entertaining from start to finish. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Lathrop Brown (Christopher Lloyd) travel to 2015 at the beginning of the movie to help save Marty's future son.While in Hill Valley in 2015, Marty gets the idea to buy a Grays Sports Almanac - providing the winners of all sporting events from 1950 to 2000 - and bring it back with him to 1985.An older Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) in 2015 overhears Marty's plan when Doc catches Marty with the sports almanac, and Tannen decides to steal the DeLorean time machine and travel back to 1955 to give his younger self the sports almanac.Viewers get to see Marty's family in the future in the beginning, but we don't really learn anything of value. We're told that Marty got into an automobile accident when he was younger, which ended up ruining his music career as a guitarist. Exposition is there just for the next film...More importantly, Marty's future family isn't featured in the rest of the film. It's just not relevant to the movie's main plot, which involves Marty and Doc traveling back in time to prevent elderly Biff from giving his younger self the sports almanac.Simply put, Back to the Future Part II is not really about Doc or Marty's friendship, or even Marty's future family. No, it's actually about Biff. This is not a bad thing per se. The alternate 1985 was an interesting idea. It was executed pretty well.It would have been repetitive for the writers to have both Doc and Marty temporarily stuck in either the alternate 1985 or 2015, but maybe that would have flowed better instead of reshowing scenes from the original movie in the second half of the film.",Character Relationships
"The end of part 1 was open - and this replays this ending for everyone. Not just to remind us what happened, but because another casting change had to be made. Marty McFlys girlfriend had to be recast (his father too, Crispin Glover that is, but you won't probably realize that for various genius reasons) - all can be seen in the documentaries on the discs of the movies.This gets us into the future ... well a weird future that already happened (2015), but did not have too many things that the movie predicted. The filmmaker say they knew flying cars would not be a thing (as also can be seen at the end of part 1). But it's neat to see them in a movie. And really funny too. Generally speaking all movies have quite some nice effects. Some you may notice (like the old age make up), some you may not notice that much.The chemistry between Marty and Doc is there and it is really something to behold. Their relationship is the backbone of the movie and he's at least as much a family member if not more to Marty than his actual flesh and blood are. Having said that, other relationships are more complicated and the movie gives us some hints to part 3 ... which if watched back to back can be relsihed and enjoyed even more than having to wait 6 months for the next movie to be released in cinemas.Very enjoyable and very entertaining and has not aged significantly at all",Character Relationships

"This is the second film of what was one of the most remarkable trilogies of the 1980s. In the first movie, Marty McFly and ""Doc"" Emmett Brown traveled until the 1950s, until Marty's parents' dating years, using a time machine built from a DeLorean. Now, the pair will need to go to the future in 2015 to prevent Marty and Jenniffer's children from becoming delinquents and dragging the entire family to the bottom. But in the midst of it all, they still have to stop the perfidious Biff Tannen from making a fortune at the expense of inside information about future sporting results. To correct the future and save the present, therefore, it will be necessary to intervene in the past, and return to 1955.The film is clearly the continuation of its predecessor and has direct connection with it. The mix of sci fi and comedy continues to succeed but it does not prevent the feeling that this movie is, in essence, more of the same as we saw before. If we forget that brief foray into the future (which for me is already a distant past, as I write this text a few years after 2015), the film is nothing really new. At any rate, it's funny to see how, in the 1980s, someone imagined our time. Flying cars? If they only knew that we were more concerned with greening cars than flying them ... But of course, nothing should be taken too seriously here. Speaking of ecology, the film suggests in one scene that DeLorean replaced the use of plutonium with organic debris and rubbish, perhaps using an original type of composter. Curious to check this out.There is little to say about the direction of Robert Zemeckis, or even about the cast, that has not been said or observed in the previous film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to dominate the film, which will be a constant throughout the trilogy. In this movie, however, the stakes of Thomas F. Wilson, an excellent villain, and Elisabeth Shue, who gain, despite their preponderance, still fall relatively sidelined for much of the movie, literally falling asleep.Special effects, visuals and sound are inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie and here they work quite well. I thought the future was quite interesting, with ultra-modern cars and some crazy ideas, but as I said, it's not something we should take too seriously. It also struck me as interesting to see the same actor playing two versions of himself, although it was clear how this was achieved by splitting the screen.It's understandable why the movie, like the whole trilogy, became so popular. Despite being weaker than the first film, it retained its features well and honored its predecessor, leaving clear signs of a continuation. The trilogy as a whole has aged very well and still has class, charm and style, which cannot be said of all films made in the 1980s.",Visual Effects

"*Back to the Future Part II* is a rare cinematic gem that manages to be both a thrilling sequel and a captivating exploration of the complexities of time travel. Released in 1989 and directed by Robert Zemeckis, this film takes audiences on a wild ride that shifts between the bustling future of 2015 and the nostalgic past of 1955, delivering a rich tapestry of adventure, humor, and reflection.The narrative picks up right where the original left off, with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) returning to the time machine DeLorean to prevent a disastrous future for Marty's son. The film's portrayal of a not-so-distant future is a brilliant mix of optimism and absurdity, showcasing flying cars, self-lacing shoes, and a world where technology has reshaped daily life in both fantastical and eerily familiar ways. The filmmakers' vision of 2015 serves as an entertaining commentary on technological progress and societal expectations, inspiring both laughter and a wistful look at how our realities compare to their predictions.One of the film's standout elements is its intricate plot, which weaves together multiple timelines and presents a unique take on the butterfly effect. The concept of time travel isn't merely a plot device; it becomes a philosophical exploration of fate, free will, and consequences. As Marty and Doc navigate the tangled web of their decisions, viewers are treated to a thought-provoking reminder of how small choices can reverberate through time, culminating in unexpected results.The film shines in its ingenious use of callbacks to the original and clever reimagining of key scenes, which gives fans a sense of nostalgia while still forging ahead with the story. The appearance of alternate versions of characters and events emphasizes the chaos that time travel can introduce, effectively highlighting the unpredictable and often humorous nature of their journey.In addition to its rich narrative, *Back to the Future Part II* thrives on its memorable supporting characters, including the devious Biff Tannen, masterfully played by Thomas F. Wilson, who continues to be a formidable antagonist even as he faces various versions of himself. Biff's antics provide comic relief while also grounding the story in the timeless struggle between good and evil.Visually, the film is a remarkable achievement, integrating groundbreaking special effects with practical designs that have stood the test of time. The bustling streets of Hill Valley in 2015 are vibrantly brought to life, and the film's creative design choices leave a lasting impression-one that still resonates in today's pop culture landscape.*Back to the Future Part II* is not just a sequel but a bold exploration of the possibilities and perils of time travel. It brilliantly balances humor and depth, serving up a delightful mix of action, wit, and a sprinkling of philosophical musings. As Marty and Doc remind us, the journey through time, filled with adventure and misadventures, ultimately leads to the realization that we are the architects of our own futures. Buckle up and prepare for a trip that's as entertaining as it is enlightening-because in the world of *Back to the Future,* the future truly is just around the corner!",Visual Effects

"Back to the Future was a big, big hit.

They went in a complete different direction with just excerpts of Glover used from the original film as well as a double.BTTF II also replaces Marty's girlfriend with Elizabeth Shue and her role has been drastically reduced.BTTF ended with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) taking Marty (Michael J Fox) and Jennifer to the future to sort out his kids.

Marty and Doc have to go back to the 1955 and the setting for the original film to restore the original time-line.BTTF II is a fast paced film as it squeezes the plots of three movies in its running time. However by going for a darker alternative time-line some of the charm of the original film was lost which was largely maintained in the future scenes set in 2015. As Fox remarked when the film came out , they wanted the future to be largely optimistic.My biggest issue always was that sports almanac with all the results of sporting events going back 50 years was an awfully thin book. Was it a prototype Kindle?Fox and Lloyd have no problems reprising their roles and very much carry on from the original film. The only odd change of character being that Marty gets upset when someone calls him chicken when he refuses a challenge.Fox has fun playing multiple characters in the film, Lea Thompson also plays her character in different time-lines and Thomas F Wilson is nasty Biff whichever time-line he is in.The film is a rollicking good adventure and a sequel that is almost shoulder to shoulder with the original. Zemeckis and Gale went on a different direction than many people expected. This is no lazy cash grab sequel. Its a time travel adventure that stands on its own self lacing Nikes and stupendously finishes with the set up to a third film.However the film does miss Crispin Glover's offbeat George McFly.

"Part II takes the surface characteristics of the original but somehow forgets to transfer the original's essence. There is something perfect in the original that just feels forced in the second one. The second one also begins the characteristic of global-scale reproduction of sequences from the original. reproducing entire sequences from the original, set in different eras and reworked. This is done for comedic purposes. We're supposed to recognise the sequences and say ""ha ha, that's right."" It is most certainly done intentionally.Like many sequals it tries to be bigger than the original and ends up being worse. A movie which tells us one brilliant small story vibrantly, so we never forget it, will usually be better than one which tries to tell us many large events and stories. It gives us more time jumping, which ends up making it uneven (which is why it stays in your mind less, I think). Its very episodic, with only the thread of getting the sports alamac off Biff and Marty and Doc to hold it together.It involves larger-scale changes to the future: Biff's becoming rich means the entire world is thrown into disarray for a portion of the film, entire areas are slums, brothels and biker-gang hovels. This kind of superlative treatment of plot will only really work for kiddies, who'll find it too unpleasant anyway.Plus, it also makes a whole lot less sense. Because it deals with so many time-jumps, there are so many more places to slip up and disregard the rules established within the world of the film for time travel: that interacting with anything in the past will change it, for instance.What is clever about the second one, and was always the thing I liked most about it when I was a boy, was how Marty and Doc go back to when the first film was taking place, and we run into those events again, we see Marty, George and Lorraine doing their bits from the first movie. Its fairly obviously trying to get people to say ""oh isn't that clever,"" but its still pretty fun all the same.",Character Relationships
"The characters are caricatures. You call McFly a 'chicken' and you can get him to do whatever you want. It's as if the creators view the audience as children.The series is called Back to the future but there's only a short period where they actually go to the future. They have the entire history and future of the world to play around with and somehow they keep going back to 1955. Which was fine in the first movie, but to revisit it again in the second movie is just overkill. If you have a time machine, would you not want to visit the dinosaurs, or want to meet Chingis Khan or Jezus, or perhaps see the world a million years into the future rather than spending Gigawatts of power to visit 1955? I get that it makes sense in the story, but the creators wrote the story... so why not make it interesting instead? I think this entire movie could have been set in the future and it would have been better.I also find the entire thing too stressful and hard to enjoy. As a viewer you're constantly worried about what they're going to do next to mess with the timeline. The characters are constantly in a hurry despite the fact that they have a time machine. Doc Brown is smart enough to invent time travel, but apparently dumb enough to put the fate of the entire galaxy in the hands of a teenager that obviously doesn't have the slightest clue about quantum mechanics.Also, the special effects are dated.The movie is fun if you're a kid, but as an adult it's pretty lame in my humble opinion.",Visual Effects
"Whose on first? There's McFly's in the future and lots of dopplegangers in the past (1955 & 1985). Some reviewers said there was too much of Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) both the old Biff guy and the young tough Biff guy but I liked the conflict that this sequel created with the tug of war(s) between the old and current Biff's and Marty McFly's. I was disappointed that Crispin Glover did not reprise his role as Marty McFly's feeble father George McFly but the writers were able to work him out of this film sequel admirably. (I understand Crispin Glover had sued Zemeckis for the illicit use of his image via a mask and he won his lawsuit?)At more than one point I will admit I lost track if Marty and Doc were in 1955 or in 1985 and which Marty McFly was real or travelling back to the future. Although the storyline was not as intriguing as the original it was more than enjoyable to want Mrs. Shullivan and I to proceed further and immediately plop in disc 3 and watch the finale film Back to the Future 3.I mean, who isn't curious what the future has in store for yourself eh?I rated this sequel an excellent 9 out of 10 rating.",Sequel Comparisons

"Let us recall the cliffhanger of an ending from the original `Back to the Future.' It is 1985. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is back from 1955. His girlfriend Jennifer (played by Elizabeth Shue this time around) and him are admiring his newfound truck. That's when Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) came back to 1985 in a hovering Delorean and brought Marty and Jennifer into the future with him. This is where the audience comes back into the film, in the year 2015. And let me tell you, Doc and Marty have really got their hands full this time�� `Back to the Future Part II' did something that not many sequels do. Because of this, it is one of the best sequels ever made. Let me explain.In a lot of movies the directors and writers complain about how the movie would have been better, but they had to make a movie that `people who didn't see the first film would understand.' Let me say something in regard to these pitiful statements. It's the fault of the people if they didn't see the original film and decided to watch the sequel anyway. Why watch a sequel if you haven't seen the first?! I guess a lot of people do��  Well, `Back to the Future Part II' was made for the people who saw the first. You just simply can't follow the storyline if you haven't witnessed the awesome power of the original (not `awesome' as in punk dialogue. I mean the true definition of awesome. Look the word up). I have seen people watch `Part II' who haven't seen the first before. It's almost funny watching them become so confused. I try to explain what's going on to them, but it is pointless. The movie is simply for those who have seen the first, plain and simple.Another wonderful aspect of `Back to the Future Part II' is that it broke away from the almost stereotypical `dark' look of the future. Blade Runner had a very sullen and dark look. Good for the film, yes, but I commend `Back to the Future Part II' for creating their own look for the future. Instead of grainy, dark images, we are presented with a very bright atmosphere. Objects are almost bouncing off the screen they are so bright. It is great.I also think that this sequel plays more on the whole idea of how changing things in the past effects things in the future. In fact, the original title of the film was going to be ""Paradox"" instead of ""Back to the Future Part II.""And then there are the marvelous, confusing-to-some plot twists that really keep you thinking, but still provide enough humor and fun to create a very, very worthy sequel to the barely superior original film.I do not really understand why people do not enjoy `Back to the Future Part II.' I read some reviews, and it appears that it is mainly because so many people saw it without seeing the original. Why would they do this? Again I ask myself and achieve no answer. Go buy the trilogy on DVD. They are great films, even if the third was a little disappointing. 4.5/5 stars for `Back to the Future Part II.'John Ulmer",Sequel Comparisons
"The first ""Back to the Future"" was a whimsical fantasy adventure that managed to blend silliness, cleverness, action, and science-fiction into a delightful ""what-if"" scenario.  ""Part 2"" picks up at the moment the original left off, with Marty and the Doc heading into the future to prevent a family disaster.  Once again, the movie attempts to blend silliness, cleverness, action, and science-fiction, but this time the total is less than the sum of the parts.In the future, Marty tries to keep his son from getting arrested for robbery, which he does, but in the process his now aged nemesis Biff steals the DeLorean and changes the his future, which, of course, changes Marty's as well.  Marty and the Doc are unaware of Biff's actions until they return to the past--er, present--and discover a world they no longer know.  Their only choice is to go back in time and prevent Biff from changing history.When stated in the form of a paragraph, the plot seems basic and flowing, but the movie is anything but.  The film has all the necessary ingredients to create a worthy sequel to the original, but none of the pieces fit together.  All the scenes feel like one-act plays, none really relating to the other until the third act, which does manage to tie a couple of threads together, but even then, many of the early parts fell like so much filler.Gone is the wry humor of the original (""You are my density""), and the cleverness of the plot, the fun of exploring the possibilities of a time paradox.  What we get in return is a chance to watch the original movie from a different angle (literally)--a treat, to be sure--but that doesn't come until the third act.  At that point we're reminded of the fun of the original ""Future"", something this sequel can't manage to recreate.In some ways, the sketchiness of the film makes sense.  The fact that ""Part 2"" doesn't end (the plot is resolved, but not everyone is where they should be) and the hints to ""Part 3"" littered throughout this installment indicate that the two films were meant to be a single story.  Together, I guess they do form a complete whole, but when compared to another ""bridge"" sequel, ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"", even that excuse fails to satisfy.  I think what we really have is filmmakers with a deadline that forced them to cut short the rewriting phase.  Pity.7/10**1/2C",Sequel Comparisons

"Back To The Future Part II is an excellent and unforgettable sequel and classic that combines amazing direction,a wonderful cast,a fantastic script,a terrific score and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future Part II while not as good as the first film,a great sequel in the Back To The Future series.Set after the events in the first film,Back To The Future Part II finds Marty(Michael J. Fox)and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)time traveling to the future in 2015. When Marty and Doc return to 1985,they discover that Hill Valley in 1985 has become a dark wasteland thanks to Biff(Thomas F. Wilson)who took the time machine and altered 1985. Now,Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955,stop Biff and go back to their lives as they remember it.After the worldwide Box Office success of the original Back To The Future in 1985,it seem obvious that there would be a sequel which would come four years later with Back To The Future Part II a brilliant and entertaining sequel(which was filmed back to back with Part III)that was a Box office hit and is a film that is just memorable and fun from start to finish. Making a sequel to a classic film like Back To The Future is no easy task,but director Robert Zemeckis has crafted a movie that while giving viewers more of the same laughs,adventure and thrills like the original while also giving Back To The Future fans something that feels fresh and exciting at the same time standing on it's own two feet while being a sequel to the first movie. The Comedy and laughs in Back To The Future Part II are funny,hilarious and on par with the original and not a moment is wasted. The scenes with the iconic Deloren car(this time flying instead of driving)are still amazing and will keep viewers thrilled and entertained. The screenplay by Bob Gale is wonderful with dialog and scenes that make the movie feel alive and imaginative. Back To The Future Part II is a film that brings back some of the characters from the first film like Marty,Doc Biff,Loraine and others and takes the concept of time travel from the first movie and gives it a clever story line on a much larger and bigger scale playing with the very serious consequences and repercussions of time-traveling with Marty and Doc going to the future,the present and then the past showing that while time traveling can be fascinating and interesting time traveling can be dangerous if used in the wrong way with Marty and Doc finding out the hard way. When Marty and Doc travel to the future in 2015 to help with Marty's kids Hill Valley's future is optimistic and bright with advanced technology and flying cars while Marty's future isn't so bright. But when the duo go back to 1985 they discover that they are in an alternate Dystopian 1985 where violence and crime is up in Hill Valley and Biff is running the town. The scenes in the alternate 1985 give BTTF II a dark tone that is sinister showing that even the smallest events can change anything. I love the fact that in Part II that Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to repair 1985 as they remember it and as viewers we see some of the events from the first film showed in this one with some minor alterations. The story for BTTF PT II may have the most complex story of the three film but the movie won't be hard to follow. The ending of Back To The Future Part II is a terrific and memorable cliffhanger ending that has surprises and thrills which sets viewers up for the final chapter in the series in Back To The Future Part III. AN amazing ending.The cast is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent and brilliant once again as Marty McFly(and multiple roles)and Doc Brown,with the two bring laughs and wonderful chemistry. Lea Thompson is terrific as Lorraine,Marty's Mother. Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as Biff and Griff,Biff's grandson. Elisabeth Shue(replacing Claudia Wells)is good as Jennifer,Marty's girlfriend. James Tolkan is great once again as Strickland,the hard nose teacher. Casey Siemazko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),J.J Cohen(Skinhead),Charles Fleischer(Terry)and Flea(Needles)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by a young Elijah Wood as Video Game Boy.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is fantastic with Zemeckis bringing the same energy and style he brought to the first film. Amazing direction,Zemeckis.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding with Silvestri's score being epic and intense matching the movie greatly. Fantastic score,Silvestri.The Special effects by Industrial,Light and Magic are dazzling and mind blowing once again. Nice job,ILM.In final word,if you love Robert Zemeckis or the first film,I highly suggest you see Back To The Future Part II,an excellent and unforgettable sequel that will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Character Relationships

"O.K, so the second part is always considered the weakest, and from a general standpoint it probably is, but there is still many admirable qualities about part 2.  For a start, the special effects and the visions of the future were imaginative and carefully planned.  Michael J Fox and Christopher lloyd are still adorable in their respective roles.  Although the rest of the cast, with the exception of Biff have little to do.  The scenes for 1955 are just a rehash of the first, but there is very little that they actually could have done to prevent that.  I thought they integrated the new characters into the old scenes quite well, in keeping with the original story from part 1.  Obviously well planned.  Because the end runs directly into part 3, part 2 was necessary for part 3 to occur.  It is a filler in a way which was made into a film of a sort.  My Conclusion, although its not as engaging as 1 or 3, it's still a worthy part of the trilogy.",Visual Effects

"I just loved Back to the Future (the original) when it was released in 1985, and was suddenly struck with the urge to see Part II.   This time the 1985 teen hero travels to the future of 2015, then back to 1955, then to a new alternative, Bladerunner-like present (1985), then back to 1955 before..... Although ok (we gave it a 7 on the 1 to 10 scale) it had some rather serious problems. 1. It's confusing, and would be hopelessly so if you haven't seen the original. 2. It lacks the whimsy of the first installment.  Things seem grimmer, there is even a murder (luckily only heard and read about but nonetheless incongruous to this type of film). 3. Very cutsey commercializations of products like Pepsi, and they are all over the film.  Very obnoxious. 4. An unanticipated problem is their portrayal of how hip and cool the present is (1985), is aging badly.  While in 2015 a scene is filmed in the Club 80s, a 1980s nostalgia club...and now you can't tell what is intentionally or unintentionally camp. And the movie ends with a cliffhanger ""to be continued....Part III.I hope they wrap it up better than Part II.",Sequel Comparisons
"After the duo uselessly bring a recast(surprising, as everyone else returned) Jennifer(forcing them to reshoot the ending of Part I) to a pretty cool, futuristic 2015(where's my hoverboard? Those things rock) purely on account of her being in the car in that scene, 1985 gets a memorable dark twist on it and to rectify matters, Marty and Doc travel back to 1955. Again. Meaning there's now two pairs of them there. And we see several bits of the first in relation to this one, and it's really put together quite well. This is much more complex than the original(so if you haven't watched that one or it's been a while, refresh your memory before starting this one, or you'll be immensely confused), and it's also, a bit of the way, fanservice to it. And is anything wrong with that? If you're watching this, presumably you love that one, those are the people who wanted more, and this is one of those follow-ups that actually hold up(and in some ways, surpass their predecessor). It does have a bit of sequelitis going on, thinking that bigger is better, but most of the time, it proves itself right, because it never does go overboard. The 80's vibe is still very much present, and the humor tends to be silly(though there are definitely some clever lines and such, as well). Lloyd mugs, Fox annoys and entertains, and a lot of the acting is deliciously over the top. Biff is again the bad guy, and he is a fun foil for our hero. The FX are larger and more detailed, and the majority of the time, they look good. While no longer a high school comedy, this has the same tone of the '85 one. The climax is tense, the time travel is used well to create more plot, and the whole thing is exciting. There is some moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who loves Back to the Future 1. 8/10",Visual Effects
"""Back to the Future 2"" is at least as engaging, entertaining and compelling as its predecessor, and that's already a praiseworthy accomplishment when dealing with sequels and/or second installments of a trilogy. Part two is perhaps slightly less regarded as a cinema classic than the 1985 original, but that's merely just because the surprise element has gone and because all the characters already feel familiar, as the screenplay is equally solid and eventful �� arguably even more so. The story lines here are admittedly more hectic and convoluted, but returning director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale never at one point lose their grip on the story that is literally stuffed with paradoxes, time loops, inside-jokes, subtle references to prequel and sequel, clever hidden trivia and accurate time details. The first film merely just featured one major journey through time, but the splendid DeLorean time machine sets off no less than three times now. Barely returned and recovered from his first time-traveling adventure, Marty as well as his girlfriend Jennifer get picked up by Doc Brown to prevent something from happening in the year 2015, before it tragically affects Marty's private family life. Everything goes more or less according to plan, except for the aging Biff Tannen �� the McFly family eternal nemesis �� borrowing the DeLorean and traveling back to 1955 to hand over an almanac with sports results to his younger self and give instructions on how to make easy millions. With the alternate 1985 being a hellish wasteland to return to, Doc and Marty have to go back to 1955 as well and prevent young Biff discovering the truth about the almanac he received from old Biff. Meanwhile, they have to pay close attention in order not to interfere with their other selves who're there to fulfill the mission narrated in part one. It's honestly far more complex to give a brief description of the synopsis than to actually watch the film, because then the whole story simply seems to unfold automatically. All the different and hugely diverse themes neatly merge together, as if the screenplay wrote itself! There are some mild changes in comparison with the original film �� released four years earlier ��what a long waiting period that must have been for the impatient fans �� like the absence of Crispin Glover as Marty's dad and Elizabeth Shue taking over the role of his girlfriend (and apparently future wife), but generally speaking the most vital aspects and cast members remained. The humor is still incredibly effective and the action sequences are impressively staged and performed, notably the final showdown between Biff and Marty in the tunnel. Obviously the story lines are more absurd, the plot twists more grotesque and the use of special effects more plentiful, but basically this still remains a Hollywood sequel and they simply have to be bigger, louder and extra spectacular. At least here it's never at the expense of ingenuity.",Visual Effects
"I remember I had watched the first film a long time before I saw this film. The first one was phenomenal, and I remember I caught a tiny bit of this one on TV, and really wanted to see what they thought 2015 would be like. I also wanted to see Marty's kid.The film picked up several seconds before the first one ended, and the movie kept going like nothing. I loved seeing Marty's kid, even though it was only brief; then things got a little weird.When Jennifer was at her future home, I felt the whole scene was weird. She was unconscious, blah blah blah. Back to the real story: they pick up an unconscious Jennifer and return to 1985. However, Hill Valley has become a ghetto, and the scene is pretty funny. Things build up for awhile in this new 1985, until Marty must go back to 1955.Now we are following Marty on the day in which the Enchantment Under the Sea dance takes place. Marty needs to get something from Biff that will affect 1985 and return them back to the normal future...At the end is another twist and it ends. Now read a review for the first film. Then read this one again. You'll notice how calm and spectacular the first film sounds, and in a way, how lousy this film sounds. Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful film, but it lost it's magic. The first film had something so deeply special, and once the story becomes complex, time consumes the humor and magic of this film (except for some moments in 2015 that will remind you of the first film!!) See this film, see the whole series, but afterwards, watch the first one again and you'll know what I'm talking about.",Sequel Comparisons
"Picture it: Phoenix. Saturday, November 25th, 1989. It was early evening at the old UA Theater at Metrocenter. There I sat at the far right of the largest theater, next to the wall since the place was packed, and on the edge of my seat, for the entire length of 'Back to the Future Part II.' See, I was a huge fan of the original, and was thrilled to see the continuation. I wasn't let down. It had action, adventure, 4x the time travel (which originally I was disappointed in #1, since I was a kid that wanted to see time travelers actually time travel), comedy and suspense. I guess the only thing I didn't like, though I did want to see even more when it finished, was the long preview of 'Part III' and the only reason I wasn't thrilled was I didn't like westerns and that's all it looked like to me. This was probably the best movie going experience in my life, before and since ��� due to the anticipation and excitement of a 15-year-old boy. Fast forward almost exactly 20 years, and after re-watching the entire trilogy, I was kind of disappointed. Sure, it's still a good movie, still had great adventure and comedy, but gone was the original's magic and heart. Too many scenes, characters, events and clues were given specifically to be solved or revealed in 'Part III.' I know it's a classic bridge movie, but it really got tedious attempting to take mental notes of what's to come. The special effects were almost laughable (the first movie came out 4 years prior and still topped this one) and Fox certainly showed his age. Nevertheless, it's a must see for fans, especially since it's required viewing (bridge) to the finish off the series.",Western Genre
"It's an exciting sequel to one of the most iconic movies in cinematic history, where Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) this time journey to the future in 2015 to prevent Marty's son from being thrown in prison. However, Marty's nemesis, an elderly Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), got a hold of the time machine and used it to change his past in 1955, sending the course of events to spiral out of control, leaving Marty and Doc to journey back to 1955 to prevent what Biff created.The special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean, and the futuristic look, with the flying cars and skateboards, in 2015 was a great touch.The direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film captivating throughout, from Marty seeing his son in the future to him chasing Biff around to steal a sports almanac which Biff stole from the future to use to change his past. Seeing the transformation from the characters in present time to the future and back to the past was just entertaining. And, Doc's notion that no two of the same persons must run into each other in the same time dimension adds onto the suspense of the film - great fun! Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson and James Tolkan. They all made the film engaging and intriguing. As a time travel film, the race against time plot makes this movie an edge-of-your-seat experiences and is one of the best sequels I've seen! Grade A",Visual Effects
"It's still fun especially the future part, I love seeing the auto-size-adjust shoes and clothes, the hoverboard and 3D movie ad etc.However, I can't help but notice the story is forced to create more events and arcs. The whole thing could have avoided if Doc goes back to the future when Marty buys the sport statistic magazine and just burn it or stop Marty before he buys it. I know if they did that, this movie would have ended there, but then I wanted the writers to sell me harder why Doc couldn't choose the path.Some choices that characters make seem way too questionable and sometimes contrived and it may have convinced the audience back then like I was as a child, but it maybe cringy to watch if you don't take into account that this film was made more than 30 years ago.Another thing is that many characters coexist with themselves at the same moment although that's the last thing you want as a premise. In Biff's case, he even interacts with himself, yet the incident doesn't mess with quantum physics at all.Lastly, Biff is just so horrible as a human being. I mean he's clearly a sociopath. I can't believe how he manages without going to jail. His character should be a bit more redeeming to be entertaining.Fans of Back to the future franchise will enjoy this sequel forever, but if you usually don't enjoy cheesiness of classic films, you may find it just okay.",Character Relationships
"This is the most disappointing sequel I've seen since Living Free (sequel to Born Free). There is no energy, no commitment, nada. What a letdown. Did Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, et al. show up just because of contract requirements? I almost asked for my money back; now I wish I had. Thankfully, Back To the Future III was very good and revalidated the trilogy. I haven't seen such a depressing fantasy since Neverending Story. When filmmakers commit to a film as wonderfully entertaining as ""Back,"" anyone working on a followup should somehow be required to achieve something as joyously memorable. This was just bad and sad, and better off forgotten.--arnie113",Sequel Comparisons
"Yesterday, my best friend and I rewatched this trilogy of Back to the Future in the movie theatre he works at. This second of the series took place partially on October 21, 2015-exactly the day we watched these again.

We then also go back to 1955-where there are now two versions of the lead characters present. There aren't as much laughs but it's still fun to watch due to many chases. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are still enjoyable enough and seeing Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson reprise their roles as Lorraine McFly and Biff Tanen also added to the fun. So on that note, Back to the Future Part II is still a worthy sequel. P.S.

The story is simply great, and the acting was great, Honestly If I've had to choose between this movie or any of the Matrix Trilogy, I would choose this, just for having such a complex topic and how it goes across the story. I believe I've seen this movie like 50 times, and I've never get tired. Michael J.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching this sequel. This is a brilliant film for all viewers to watch. The storyline is great. The cast selection is mighty and incredible. They continued to commit and connect from the first instalment. The chemistry between them is strong. This film makes viewers really think about their lives and the world that they live in. It makes viewers wonder about the multiple possibilities of what a parallel universe of their world would look like and what that would do to their lives. Another thing that it makes viewers think about is the pathways and possibilities that the future may hold for them. It makes viewers wonder if they need to change their lives for the better. This is a tremendous film for all viewers to watch and enjoy.,Sequel Comparisons
"After re-watching the original with my young son (I watched it with him--we both loved it of course) we rented this sequel, which I had never seen. It was *really* painful to watch.Most of the problems seemed to be traceable to the writing, which is strange as it's the same Gale/Zemeckis pair that wrote the original. The humor had a tiresome elbow-in-the-ribs obviousness to it, the dialog lacked any charm or style and seemed largely devoted to (re-)explaining what was going on right in front of us on the screen (perhaps an aid to the visually impaired?), and the conceptualization of the future never rose above kind of warmed-over Jetsons idiocy (flying cars, video-screen robot waiters, self-tying shoes, hoverboards instead of skateboards, etc.).The fine cast seemed to be almost uniformly phoning it in, making the few who seemed to actually be working at it (Christopher Lloyd, for one) seem incongruous and pathetically out of place, as if they were in a different movie.Incoherent, un-amusing, and utterly pointless.",Sequel Comparisons
"It happens a lot: you get a wonderful, original movie that's both funny and exciting, and then you get a sequel that tries to be as good as the original, but it tries too much, and turns out to not even come close. ""Back to the Future Part II"" isn't an exception, but it's definitely an improvement.Here's the story: literally starting off where the original ended, Doc takes Marty (and Jennifer) to the future (2015, to be exact), where Marty has to correct a terrible incident that would result in disaster to his family (his future family, that is). And he more or less succeeds in doing that. However, what happens next is where the plot really takes off: Marty buys a sports almanac with statistics from 1950-2000 in it, simply to take back with him to 1985, and use it to 'place a couple bets'. But not if Doc has anything to say about it! Doc throws it away immediately, reminding Marty that that's not what he built the time machine for. So what's the problem? Seventy-seven year old Biff Tannen overhears that whole conversation! So what does he do? Exactly what 17 year old and 47 year old Biff would do: he takes the book from the trash can, steals the DeLorean, goes back in time, and gives the book to young Biff and tells him exactly what to do with it. How Doc and Marty find out about all this is far to interesting to reveal. And there are still a few surprises after that, but I think I may have already gone too far.So the bottom line for ""Back to the Future Part II"" is this: no, it's not as good as the original. The primary reason is the fact that the first 30-40 minutes or so are just too 'gimmicky', with too many little jokes about what the year 2015 will be like in Hill Valley. However, it's the second half of the movie that's really worth watching, as Marty and Doc travel all over time, trying to put Hill Valley and everyone in it back to normal. Another reason to see this is simply so you can watch ""Back to the Future Part III"", which is even better than this one (really).",Sequel Comparisons
"Back to the Future Part II reunites us with Doc and Marty McFly as they get up to more shenanigans. This time the story is of Marty McFly having to go into the year 2015 to correct his kids' wrong doings. But he makes a mistake and must go back to the year 1955 to prevent the mistake having a disastrous effect on 1985, without disturbing anything he did in the first one. I liked the first one, I also liked this one. I actually like this one more. The special effects are amazing and it's filled with ""how did they do that? When the hell did this film come out? The 80's? God damn that's amazing."" But for all its glorious sets and special effects there is few plot holes and lots of things which are just plain stupid. But to enjoy this film, you pretty much have to just shut off your brain. For the time it was great, and I'd imagine so many people were dazzled by the special effects that they didn't notice the stupidness that was all over it. Also, the acting could've been improved but aside from that. It's an enjoyable little film and you really just have to enjoy it for what it's worth. It's not amazing, but it was in the 80's.",Visual Effects
"Yikes!Back to the Future Part II sees Marty & Jennifer coerced by Doc into travelling forward in time to correct the future. But Biff is still around and spies an opportunity for untold riches; which he takes. Meaning our three time travelling wonders have to find a way back to the past to stop Biff from changing the course of history.The gargantuan, and deserved, success of Back To The Future ensured {demanded} that a sequel would follow. So taking the bull by the horns, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gray crafted not only a sequel, but a trilogy, of which part two is ultimately a sort of interim plot filler for the finale to come a year later. There's no doubt about it, part two is at first a puzzle box of a picture, one that had this particular viewer back in the day venturing in for multiple viewings to unravel the deft, daft, but intricate plot.I have grown to love part two very much as I have got older, with each viewing tending to reward me just a little bit more. Directed with absolute keenness by Zemeckis, the film moves at such a pace there is barely time to catch breath, something that hardly helps one to follow exactly what is going on. But it does make sense under scrutiny, and as we lurch from one magnificent set piece to another, we find a dark undercurrent of bleakness in amongst the froth.The makers offer up two visions of the future, one is all colourful and swamped in glorious 80s nostalgia, yet it's knowingly enveloped in consumerism and hi-tech reliability. The other is bitten by greed and almost under despotic control, it's food for thought and rather wry in its telling. Not content with that, the makers whisk us back to 1955 just to remind us that a time of innocence and hope did exist; and simultaneously with skill they repeat the ending of part one with the additional story of part two! Clever eh? The returning cast are again uniformly strong {Michael J. Fox, Thomas F. Wilson & Christopher Lloyd} while Elisabeth Shue confidently steps into Jennifer's shoes after Claudia Wells {Jennifer in part one} fell ill and was unable to continue the role. Alan Silvestri's score still packs a cross dimension's punch and the effects crew again come up trumps {it's ace in HD}. It now can be seen as the bridge between two better movies, that's for sure, but I liken it to Spielberg's Temple Of Doom-more darker than the more favourable films in a series; but one that is crucially still having fun. It may be a high-tempo ball of funny confusion at times, but this one, courtesy of it's ream of homages and sly observations, is one of the best trilogy sandwich fillers going.Munch it. 8/10",Visual Effects

In some ways this better than the original in my mind because the plot has more anticipation than either of the others. It's a great extension to the original story. Great way of turning a 2 hour film (Back to the Future Part I) into a 5 hour film. I love how this one has such an involved plot. Gale and Zemeckis really found probably the best to expand their original story.

"The original Back to the Future is a perfect movie. Brilliantly written, paced, acted, directed, and edited. There's never a dull moment, the story is great from start to finish, and the fantastical elements are never so far fetched as to break the suspension of disbelief.Not so with the sequel.Taken as a stand alone film, it's complex, very silly, but still entertaining. However, taken as a sequel to such a masterpiece, it's a borderline mess. The story is all over the place, needlessly complex, and incredibly silly. Michael J Fox plays himself and his kids in multiple ways, rendering several scenes as little more than ridiculous farce. The lack of the brilliant Crispin Glover as George McFly is obvious throughout too, with the various out of focus stand ins looking just awful. The movie also fails to build to any sort of climax, with it feeling throughout like a collection of random, often bizarre and unrelated sequences which seem to exist purely to show off prosthetic or split camera effects. Compared to the perfect storytelling and character arcs of the original, it's truly staggering that this script ever got approved.If for some reason you've never seen the Back to the Future films, just see the first and skip the awful sequels.",Sequel Comparisons
"I know this may get a lot of flack, but I actually like this movie more than the first one. Now don't get me wrong, the first one is a BETTER FILM. It is objectively better than this movie, but man this one is just so much fun.OK, yes, some of the special effects didn't age well, and some errors between this and the first film may exist. Plus why is the daughter played by Micheal J. Fox, wouldn't it make more sense to have the actress playing Jennifer play the daughter.But man this movie is fun, it completely takes full advantage of the idea of time travel. Having alternate timelines, going both back and forward, and making the future, a future that isn't bleak and depressing. The future is just plain awesome, overblown in the way people dress, but awesome. The hoverboard chase scene in my opinion is even better than the skateboard chase in the first film. It has some pretty damn great effects for the time. I still can't believe that putting Micheal J. Fox as three people in the same shot was possible in 1989. It's still extremely funny, and I like how dark it gets in the second half.Is the first film technically better, yes it is, but I enjoy this movie more, it takes full advantage of it's time travel premise, and is just a lot of fun.",Visual Effects

And when I say good-looking, still seeing the futuristic Hill Valley today still looks amazing, even though it was 1989. The plot, on the other hand, relies on repeating the third act of the first film over again. But it has fun with it, so it's somewhat forgivable. But where the film really shines is in it's writing, especially with the one-liners, the long over-complicated speeches and warnings from Doc, and of course, Biff's screen door on a battleship line.

"Back to the Future Part II picks up from the exact point where the original film left us, with Doc Brown coming to fetch Marty in order to take him into the future. And from that point we get an exhilarating story worthy of the first one. This is also the film that gave us most of those Back to the Future clich��s and tropes, with hoverboards, self-tying shoes and ridiculous Jaws sequel banners. The future this film imagined was an awesome place, and even though the exact date they travelled to has already passed, it's still a fun to see what the 80s thought the next millennium was going to look like.It's also a great film in terms of keeping up what worked in the original. All the actors reprise their roles, and they're as talented, great and into it as before. Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is still easily the biggest showstealer, but both Fox and Wilson give very good and suitably over the top performances as Marty and Biff, respectively, as well.The only problem I have with this film is the fact that it goes over much of the same ground that we already covered in the first film. In many cases we even go over the exact same scenes, only from slightly different perspective. They do it cleverly and I applaud them for their ingenuity, but it still means that we for the most part already know what's going to happen, which makes certain scenes boring to watch. It doesn't really ruin the film, but it was a nuisance, at least for me.But, overall, this is an amazing sequel, one of the best the industry has ever produced. It's fast, loose, filled with laughs and even though it doesn't quite capture the flow and grace of the original, it's still more than worth checking out. Far more.",Sequel Comparisons

The first (future) part of the movie is great , filled with amusing things, such as Jaws 19 and antique shops, selling vacuum cleaners from 1985.
But the second part of the movie...I just couldn't get rid of a deja vu felling. And that's why, i just couldn't rate this one so high as The first Back to the future (9 out of 10). But hey, no matter what, this movie still deserves a hall of fame, and that's why still a high grade of7 out of 10.",Sequel Comparisons
"This is a good follow-up of the original movie, which I love. While this isn't as good as the first one, it's still a worthy sequel. It's a fun and entertaining way to spend a Saturday evening with your family.",Sequel Comparisons
This is one of the best sequels of all time and i think it's even better than the first one.,Sequel Comparisons
"A wacky, crazy, very fun kind of movie with only some remnants of the kind of heart the first movie had. That said though, it is immensely entertaining. It may even be more fun to watch at this point than the first one, and maybe that's because so much of the first one is included in this one anyway, it's sort of like bonus edition. There are some genuine thrills here too as the sports almanac Biff vs. Marty plot device really pays off nicely. The only sad thing about this one is that it turns ends with a cliff hanger and a preview of part three. A terrible way to end a film (I think). This plus the zany multiple universe-time-travel-happiness of this movie gives it a sort of schizo feel, but again, it's super fun to watch again. A great, probably underrated series.",Sequel Comparisons
"In my opinion, this is the strongest Back to the Future film in the three part trilogy. The highlight was undoubtedly the 2015 future sequence, as the visual effects and costumes used to create the realistic and vibrant setting were just awesome and so cool to watch. From the auto tying shoes, to the hoverboard, this sequence was just so ahead of its time and is still a blast to watch today. Micheal J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's bond is without a doubt one of the greatest film duos ever created, and as if they didn't entertain us enough in first film, the second instalment only shows us more of their quirky and fun relationship, providing plenty of laughs along the way. Whether you are revisiting the film or watching it for the first time, this is truely one of the most enjoyable and entertaining films I have ever watched and I couldn't recommend it enough!",Visual Effects
I liked this movie better than the other 2. People say they can't understand it so maybe they should pay more attention to it or go back to school cause when I first saw this at 7 in the theater I understood it perfectly so I have no idea why people don't understand it now. BTTF1 I liked but this one blew the first one away. It was well written and had a lot of special effects. This movie is perfect and as a matter of fact I think I'll bring out the tape and watch it all over again.,Visual Effects

"The film starts just before the end of the previous film so we see Marty, the Doc and Jennifer take off for the future, this time however we see that Biff has witnessed their departure. Once in the future Marty must intervene to prevent his son from getting involved with a robbery being planned by Biff's grandson. Things might have gone well if that was all that he did however he has an idea to make a bit of money on his return by taking a book of future sports results back with him. Doc tells him to destroy the book but he leaves it it the DeLorean. Having overheard this conversation Biff steals the car while they are picking up Jennifer and returns it before they notice it had gone.When they return home to 1985 everything has changed, the town of more like a war zone, somebody else is living in Marty's house and Biff is a millionaire living in a casino with Marty's mother. Marty confronts him and finds out that Biff had been given the future sports book by somebody claiming to be a relative back in 1955, using the results inside he had amassed a fortune. The only way to set things right is to go back to 1955 once more and retrieve the book before Biff can use it.I enjoyed the darker tone of this film although some of the special effects in the future scenes looked a bit ropey by today's standards.",Visual Effects
"The first part of this movie is way too good. And Hollywood is good known for creating stupidest sequels. The first part is about the protagonist travels to past, gets stuck and tries to get back into present time. When it comes to the second part the story completely changes, the protagonist and the doctor (who found the time travel) travels to the future to save his child from a terrible situation. They didn't even try with the screenplay properly. Was way too boring. I'd highly choose the first part, rather than this.Not much highly recommended but best entertainment for family audiences.",Sequel Comparisons

I think that Back to the Future Part II is the best out of the trilogy. They are all awesome but number 2 is my favorite out of them all.  It is funny to see what people back in the late 80's thought that 2015 was going to look like.  Everyone does a great job with there rolls changing and having to take on a different scenery with each movie.  From going from the 50's to the future and then to the old west.  Robert Zimeckis did a great job with this.,Western Genre
This movie is a classic. One of my top ten movies of all time. The whole trilogy is great. I could never figure out why they never made a trilogy box for this series. This is definetly one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion and in other opinions. Who would've thought a Deolorian could take you so far. The whole trilogy is well thought out and the effects are excellent even for today. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the best. I choose the second one over the rest because in a way its sort of like two movies in one and the plan was very well thought out.,Visual Effects
"Being a big fan of the original, I was quite happy with this sequel. The intrigue of time travel into the future is one of the biggest allures for science fiction, and Part 2 makes it look very clean and fun. Granted, there are some major plot holes that result from the ""cause and effect"" paradox of time travel, but for the sake of entertainment, we have to push that away. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fun the second time around, with the continuum of time at stake this time. After journeying into the future, they discover they have to go back and fix the past again - the 1955 that they'd already visited. The movie is fun, fancy, and it keeps you hooked to the end. I don't know what problem the critics had with this one; I liked it, because it took the spirit of the first one, and transformed it into a dynamic story, enjoyable action scenes, and respectable dialogue. Not to mention the special effects were very well done for the time-frame of the film. If you liked the first one, you will like the sequel. Don't listen to the naysayers; you have to experience it for yourself.",Visual Effects
"Back to the Future II isn't as good as the other two, but it is a necessary middle act that bridges Parts I and III. The best part, the part that I grew up with is the 2015 sequence, when Marty uses the hover board. And it was really fun when there were two Marty's and two Doc Brown's in 1955 and how they happen to run into each other. Alan Silvestri's music for this film is pretty much what it was from the first film (a fitting continuation of the first film if not inspired - wait until Part III for Silvestri's best score of the trilogy!) I really again enjoyed the performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, their on-screen interactions are stuff legends are made of. Even though I consider Part II the weakest in this trilogy, it's still a worthy entry, worth an 8 out of 10. Enjoy!",Soundtrack Quality
"I just got done watching Back to the Future Part II (1989) for the first time ever and while this movie was an great way to continue the trilogy.Positives for Back to the Future Part II (1989):
It was fun to once again step back into the world with these characters and their shenanigans. The movie does touch on the concept of the consequences of time-travel and how it can drastically effect certain events in time which I would hope doesn't happen at any point. I still really enjoyed the movie's cast here and you get some new additions in there. Michael J. Fox is still charming and captivating as Marty McFly as he was in the original. Christopher Lloyd is even more ecentric and crazy as Doc Brown here than he was in the original and he manages to make that work. Thomas F. Wilson is still great as Biff Tannen and he is somehow even more despicable here than he was in the original which makes his failures here even more satisfying to watch happen. I also really liked Elisabeth Shue as Jennifer Parker even if she's not in the movie for that long. It was really cool to see a cameo from a young Elijah Wood. Alan Silvestri's musical score is still awesome here as it was in the original. There are still some amazing special effects in this movie with the time-travel sequences. You get some fun little action set pieces here with the hoverboard. And finally, I love the way how this movie ends while also setting up things for the next movie in this trilogy.Negatives for Back to the Future Part II (1989):
The only thing that I can say about this movie is that it doesn't feel quite as fresh or unique as the original, but that's very common with a lot of sequels.Overall, Back to the Future Part II (1989) is a fantastic continuation of the original and I can't wait to watch Back to the Future Part III (1990).",Soundtrack Quality
"Back to the future II is a science fiction movie starring Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson. The movie is directed by Robert Zemeckis and it's second part of the trilogy.The movie is as good and entertaining as it's first part and it's looks good to see 2015 from the perspective of 1989(1985 in the movie). The plot is very well orchestrated and will not be very difficult to understand. The climax of the movie is little stretched and can be little irritating.The acting is great. The background music gets little louder at some scenes but mostly supports the movie.Overall a great and enjoyable sequel which sets the plot for the third part very beautifully.",Soundtrack Quality
"I actually liked this follow up to Robert Zemeckis's 1985 hit better than the original.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are back as time-traveling Marty McFly and his mad-scientist companion, but this time they bounce back and forth between past and present in a convoluted plot. Admittedly, the plot is more complicated than it needs to be, but because so much time is spent years into the future, the film provides more opportunities for nifty special effects.The series would continue with one more sequel set in the wild west, which I have not seen.Grade: B+",Western Genre
"All trilogy is associated with my chidhood. Also it's great sci-fi movie that made a lot of trends. Firstly, the plot continues the story of first film and shows us future - 2015.

Thirdly, the visual effects is amazing (for that time - outstanding). Also, it has beautiful soundtrack.So, it's one of the best sci-fi movie.",Soundtrack Quality
"This sequel to the 1985 hit was a bit of a miss for me. We still had the great soundtrack, and the subplot of the almanac , but found the film lacked the energy, fun the first had. You would only ever watch it to complete the series. Good use of CGI, and the actors playing against themselves look flawless. Middle age Biff could pass of as Trump, followed by a vastly superior sequel in 1990. I didn't think the story flowed as well in this, and Jennifer's character seems pointless. Whoever replaced Crispin Glover had the right look but the voice was a bit too high. 3/5. Looking forward to rewatching the third .",Soundtrack Quality
"The end of the first film gave an unambiguous answer - to continue to be. And now in the new film, the plot sends the characters into the future. At the time of the film's release, it was incredibly cool to see 2015, which is shown to us in the film. I remember every viewing of this trilogy and a clear feeling that has remained to this day - Back to the Future 2 is the best of all three films for me. Precisely because you see the future there. Excellent visual solutions, by the way, allowed the film to be nominated for an Oscar for best effects. The scriptwriters and the director perfectly saw what their world of the future would be like, paying attention to details. And the legendary pink skate that flew straight through the air will forever remain a childhood dream for millions of children of that time.The actors' acting is on top again. It doesn't matter that the actress playing Jennifer was replaced, it didn't affect the perception at all. The actress perfectly fit into the team, making her heroine a part of the universe Back to the Future.Marty McFly appears as an older copy of himself. Makeup helps to show age. After all, it's been 30 years. But the main thing that I noticed for myself, the actor's acting is his eyes. Fox did a great job with the image of the father of the family, who has already lived a life, has seen a lot. I think it's the actor's merit to convey the age of the hero in this way.Dr. Brown is in his repertoire. Still wild and purposeful. Lloyd shines on the screen, not letting you take your eyes off him for a second. He is here on a mission to save the future of his younger friend's family, once again showing friendship what it should be.Tanons are colorful as always, unpleasant, as befits antiheroes. Thomas Wilson more than copes with several roles at once, giving each character its own uniqueness.The movie is quite dynamic. Adventures switch from one event to another, and the explanation of confusing moments with time travel allows you not to lose the thread of the narrative. And of course, the sequel was obliged to raise the bar, which was done when, in the interweaving of storylines, the heroes of this film were not supposed to meet themselves from the past. And every scene that was almost frame-by-frame reproduced is a pleasure when you realize how responsibly the creators of the picture approached this work.The music is back on top. To this day, Alan Silvestri's melody makes you smile mentally when footage from the film pops up in front of your eyes.The movie is bright and interesting. It is perfect for family viewing, giving an excellent couple of hours in the piggy bank of life.9 out of 10.",Soundtrack Quality
"Back to the Future is one of the most influential films in cinema history, marking a generation and expanding its success to this day. Owner of an original plot and revolutionary effects for the time, the plot's popularity reached levels rarely seen in cinema. Originally, the idea of screenwriters Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis was just to close the film with an anecdote, a way to end the story by implying that the adventure continued. With the resounding success of the feature film, Universal Pictures saw the joke as a great opportunity to make more money at the box office, thus giving the go-ahead for a continuation, which would generate two more sequels. The film was produced with a budget of forty million dollars and was shot together with its continuation; filming began in February 1989, after two years of building the sets and writing the scripts. Two actors from the first film, Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells did not return. Wells abandoned her career in Hollywood and Crispin was replaced by Jeffrey Weissman who received makeup to look like Glover, so that some scenes from the original film could be reused. Except that the actor had not allowed the reuse of his scenes, he sued Spielberg and won (since then, new laws have been created in the USA on image reuse).The script presents the same structure that we saw before - the interaction between generations different at the same age - but only in the future / present and in a much more frantic way. The script is very agile, but never exactly confusing, although it may depend a little too much on expository dialogues. All this, because this adventure in the future is only the first of three in the same film. With the various comings and goings in time, and the alternative reality of 1985, some say that the plot of Back to the Future 2 is too confusing. But Doc Brown is there to explain in a very didactic way - including a blackboard and drawings - what is happening in the plot. Nothing to mess with anyone's brain.In this second part, the comedy and innovative situations proposed by the first film are replaced by unbridled, breathtaking action. Point for the duo of screenwriters Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis: knowing that the freshness of the original story could not be matched, the two came up with an intricate adventure, full of twists and references to the series pilot. So, when we look back at the adventures of Marty McFly in 1955, a little of the emotion that we felt previously comes back to us. An interesting point of the script is the variation over several scenes from the original film: there is a sequence just like the one in which Marty runs away from Biff on a skateboard (here the skateboard is flying, and old Biff comments: 'This seems familiar '; another in which he thinks he dreamed of everything and his mother brings him back to reality; and so on. Other scenes have been fully recreated in order to include the characters in the second film (like the one where Marty plays Johnny B. Good while another Marty sways on the scaffold over his head).
Revisiting the original film gives the audience a chance to take a different perspective on scenes we've previously seen. In addition to demonstrating the whimsy of the production, which manages to recreate scenarios and sequences in detail, we have a rare opportunity to see in another angle key moments of the original feature, such as Marty McFly's show at the Encanto Submarino ball, the clash between Biff and George in the parking lot and, of course, the best scene in the whole trilogy, the lightning bolt hitting the clock tower, the only one that is repeated in the three films. Although they took several precautions to make the visit to the original film perfect, the absence of Claudia Wells as Jennifer Parker (replaced by Elisabeth Shue) and Crispin Glover as George McFly (now replaced by Jeffrey Weissman, now appearing with archival images)) ended up undermining the success of the attempt. Anyway, nothing that spoils the fun, being a more noticeable detail for fans than for the general public.It is incredibly fun to imagine that a second Marty observed almost all the adventures of the first Marty and that the two Docs even talked in 1955. The idea of addressing the same events raises the potential for a temporal paradox to the tenth power, creating a real speculative source of blow the head. If the first third is fun, but flawed and the second is more flawed than fun, the third almost completely redeems the sins of Zemeckis and Gale. Merging recreations of iconic sequences with the reuse of passages from the original film, Zemeckis and Gale give a narrative show while Harry Keramidas and Arthur Schmidt simply innovate in the complicated task of assembling the work.As in the first film, the city of Hill Valley itself is an important character: it is the changes that occur in it that give the dark tone to the alternative gift created by Biff. It is worth, once again, the comparison with the small town of Happiness Is Not Buying, Bedford Falls (see the review for Back to the Future): the alternative Hill Valley would be the Bedford Falls that would exist if James Stewart's George Bailey did not had been born. Also worth mentioning is the Hill Valley of the future, a fantastic creation by the people of art direction and stage design (always together, of course, with Dean Cundey, the series' competent director of photography).There are, of course, some problems in the script, which are totally forgivable compared to the final set. For example, where did the change in Doc's behavior come from since the future is unknown? After all, he almost died, in the previous film, from not wanting to know what would happen to his future self. In Back to the Future 2, however, he takes Marty McFly to 2015 to shamelessly change the course of events. However, shortly afterwards he makes a speech about maintaining the continuum of the universe. Also, it seems that Gale and Zemeckis didn't quite know what to do with Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer: she spends most of the movie asleep. But, after all, who is she? Why did you marry Marty? (There is a hint that the wedding was not quite what she wanted, but only).According to Bob Gale and Bob Zemeckis, it was never the intention of the writers to take the story into the future - simply because it is extremely difficult to get it right. Therefore, the two decided to extrapolate when they had to follow the original joke and send the characters for 2015, thirty years in the future. For today's audiences, it's fun to watch what hit and miss the film's producers. Screenwriter Bob Gale, director Robert Zemeckis and the entire technical team, especially the art direction and costumes, had to imagine their own future and which, over time, proved capable of predicting future trends in fashion and behavior.
No flying cars, floating skateboards (hoverboards), pizzas that grow in seconds, self-adjusting and self-drying jackets, self-tie shoes. However, we can notice biometrics (several scenes in the film show people using digital to access some place or document), holograms (the one that scares Marty at the beginning of the film), drones (like the ones that take dogs for walks in Hill Valley - although not quite what we see today), video calls (another very common feature today but that was practically unthinkable in the 1980s, which we would have today technologies like Skype, Whatsapp and Facetime, for example), tablets ( at one point, Marty is introduced to a ""digital clipboard""), giant televisions (several houses and businesses have televisions with large screens), games (in his traditional cafeteria, Marty plays with some kids in a video game that captures movement and uses peripherals , similar to the current Kinect and Wii). A few years ago, Nike announced the arrival of Marty McFly's Nike Air Mag (although it lit up and had the look of the film, the shoes did not have the main characteristic of their cinematographic counterpart: the automatic laces). All the exaggerations and situations imagined in 2015 make everything even more fun so many years later.The special effects are fantastic, as is the makeup. There is a scene, for example, in which Michael J. Fox plays three different characters who interact with each other (he plays the role of Marty at 47 and his two children: a boy and even a girl). The sequence is brilliant and innovative for the time. In fact, this type of 'encounter' happens several times during the film: the two Biffs (the one from 1955 and the 2015 one; the two Doc Browns (the one from 1955 and the 1985 one) and the two McFlys (both from 1985). It's a great exercise in visual effects, with the use of the VistaGlide camera developed by IL&M, but the end result, which still has a new George McFly upside down and full of prostheses to disguise the actor change ends up becoming a sequence strange, not very well developed and cluttered with information and that would only really end in the epilogue of Part III. Gale and Zemeckis took advantage of all the opportunities they had to create scenes in which visual effects were fundamental. car details in the scenes that take place in the future, that blend wonderfully in scale with the actual footage, being put together in virtually imperceptible transitions.In a very clever way, the script ends a cycle, attenuating the impression of ""middle film"" which is a very common feature in trilogies, for obvious reasons. This second part is a far above average experience, appropriating the original's concepts and ideas to literally expand its own universe. With visual effects even better than the original and with a roller coaster rhythm, it may not be as good as the original, but it has many qualities that make it very close. Its ending is an open one, with the end of the adventures of Marty and Doc Brown taking place in Back to the Future 3 (1990), an unsuspected comic western.",Soundtrack Quality
"This is a good movie. It's funny, it's imaginative, the cast is lovable, and the music is great. A classic adventure, and a lot of fun.",Soundtrack Quality
"Since Part II and Part III of this franchise were shot together does that mean we can refer to it as Back to Back Back to Back to the Future?The paradoxes don't end there. They've not even begun yet. The fact that Part II contradicts the laws of 4-dimensional physics laid down in the first movie is not a problem unless you want it to be. There are a lot of wannabe smart-asses out there who think they are overnight geniuses for picking plot holes in Part II. Robert Zemeckis has said that it is the most complex film he has ever made. I think that the complicated nature of the story, the dark middle act, and abrupt cliffhanger perhaps alienate some of the more simple viewers and that has led to Part II being the most underrated and misunderstood of the series.It's also my favorite for those exact reasons, and more.Like the first movie Part II is an icon of a now past future. It may have got some predictions laughably incorrect but it did get many frighteningly accurate. Video phones came true, hover- boards entered pop culture, and a madman with bad hair became the most powerful man in the world. But since this all exists in a timeline manipulated by Marty and Doc it is all in its own universe and therefor plausible. Who's to say that it wasn't Doc Brown himself who invented the technology of flying cars.With the distractions of visual effects, action scenes, and complex stories it is easy for one to forget that the Back to the Future movies are comedies. It is my personal opinion that Christopher Lloyd and Crispin Glover were robbed of Academy Awards in 1986 (does anyone give a crap about William Hurt in Kiss of the Spider Woman or Don Ameche in Cocoon?). They were not even nominated. Doc Brown and George McFly are characters that stay with you. However, Part II is Thomas F. Wilson's time to shine and he absolutely dominates this movie. Biff Tannen is my favorite character of the series - a lunkhead bully, cruel just for the sake of being cruel, who is so dumb that even his older self is bemused by his stupidity. While Marty and Doc are the leads it is Biff who is the comedic heart of the series.There are weakness though. Silvestri's score for this entry is the worst of the series - full of underscoring and tension with very little in the way of excitement outside of the opening and closing credits. I'm not entirely satisfied with Doc's silly ""it's just a big coincidence"" explanation for old Biff going back to November 5th 1955 either. I know it' supposed to be a joke but I think a smarter reason would be that the date would have been stored in the time circuits and Biff simply selected it because it seemed appropriate. But I'm being far too pedantic.The best scene in all of the Back to the Future movies is without a doubt the lightning striking the clock tower while Marty and Doc struggle to send the 1.21 gigawatts into the flux capacitor. The editing and timing of this is absolutely perfect down to the last frame. Not only do we get to experience it again in Part II but it even continues with the other Marty interrupting Doc's celebration. I first saw this movie in Summer 1990 while on a long plane journey so the trailer for Part III at the end wasn't so much a tease for me. I only had to wait about a week before I was sitting in the cinema watching it.Fun times. If only I could go back and relive it again...",Soundtrack Quality
"A good script, above average special effects and likeable characters. We can use this review when we evaluate the movie on its own, but this is a sequel, so we should also consider the first movie. I have to say that it's the same movie. Is it bad? No, but it's the same. Let me put it this way, it's like watching a version of the first movie with a different theme. If we agree on that, let's talk about the movie: All the comments I made about the first movie apply to this one (gripping script, sympathetic characters, iconic soundtrack). So there's no need to go on too long. I offer my respect to everyone who contributed to this work.",Soundtrack Quality
"Back at 1985, Robert Zemeckis brought us Back to the Future, a story about Marty McFly who travels back to 1955 in a Delorean his nuclear physicist friend Dr. Emmet Brown made. In order to get back to 85, he has to seek the help of Doc Brown's 1955 counterpart and help his father fall in love with his mother. It became a worldwide box office phenomenon both critically and financially. Later, in 1989, Zemeckis and the other crew planned to make a film trilogy starting with Part 2.Taking place in the cliffhanger from the first movie, Marty McFly, Jennifer, and Doc Brown travel to the year 2015 to prevent Marty's future son from sabotaging his family's future. Meanwhile, their arch nemesis Biff Tannen (his future self) steals the time machine and uses it to alter history for his benefit, creating an alternate version of 1985. So, it's up to Marty and Doc Brown to travel back to 1955 and restore the timeline.Now that it's been thirty years, Part II is an example of a sequel that is very good. Before I give this a lot of praise, yes, it does retread the first film in some ways (which is the only reason why some people don't like this sequel very much), but that's my only nitpick. Everything else is done very well. The story expands on the first movie going into full detail on the whole concept of alternate timelines. It also gives a character backstory to Biff Tannen on why he's been a bully to George McFly back at 1955 due to his wealth. Not to mention it left another cliffhanger (which I'll get to in my review of Part III).That being said, the production design is fantastic from the futuristic 2015 setting to the alternate 1985 setting. The directing and editing is superb and the pacing is very good. Alan Silvestri reprises the themes from the first film in spectacular fashion while introducing some new themes. And the acting from everyone is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to shine in their chemistry as Marty McFly and Doc Brown while Thomas F. Wilson gives some complexity to his role as Biff Tannen. Other actors including Elisabeth Shue and Jeffrey Weissman (who replaced Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover as both Jennifer and George McFly) and returning actors including Lea Thompson and James Tolkan as Lorraine McFly and Mr. Strickland do a good job too.Overall, Part II may not be on par with the original, but it's a good sequel in it's own right. Go check it out to those who haven't seen it yet. :)",Soundtrack Quality
"Great Scott! Buckle up, flux capacitor charged, because we're hurtling back to 1989 with Back to the Future Part II! As a fellow BTTF fanboy, I gotta admit, this sequel holds a special place in my DeLorean-shaped heart. But does it capture the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of the original, or is it destined to fade into the dusty corners of cinematic history? Let's hit the gas and find out!First things first, the good stuff: This movie is a time-traveling joyride, packed with even more mind-bending twists and turns than a Doc Brown invention convention. Zipping between 1985, 2015 (a future that feels eerily prescient in 2024!), and an alternate 1985, the story is a wild, imaginative romp that keeps you glued to the screen. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd reprise their iconic roles with effortless charm, their comedic timing and on-screen chemistry as Marty McFly and Doc Brown never missing a beat. Plus, Biff's transformation into a power-hungry tycoon in the alternate 1985 is deliciously villainous, adding a healthy dose of peril to the fun.Even with its minor flaws, Back to the Future Part II is a timeless classic. It's a testament to the power of imagination, friendship, and good old-fashioned fun. It might not be as groundbreaking as its predecessor, but it's still a hilarious, heartwarming adventure that will leave you grinning from ear to ear (and maybe even humming the Power of Love theme song).Verdict: 8 out of 10 plutonium rods. Back to the Future Part II might not be as groundbreaking as the original, but it's still a time-traveling triumph fueled by humor, heart, and the enduring legacy of Marty McFly and Doc Brown. Just remember, even if the future isn't exactly what we expected, the power of friendship and a good DeLorean can still take you on an unforgettable ride. Now, where's that flux capacitor...?",Soundtrack Quality
"After the gigantic success of Back to the Future in 1985, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale reunite for the sequel Back to the Future Part II. It received mixed reviews upon release, but it has gained a cult following in the years since release. Personally, I always enjoyed the movie. Yes, it does have an extremely complicated plot with many different time frames and paradoxes and whatnot. But if you want to avoid a headache and be take in for a wild ride, it may be best to shut off your brain for two hours. The movie had enough jokes to take the film into screwball territory at times. I still find the interactions between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd to be gold. What surprised me and the audience in 1989 was how dark the film became when our heroes ventured back in the '85 world. I thought they entered the world of Blade Runner but no, that is just part of the plot. I liked their depiction of 2015. Gale and Zemeckis weren't trying to predict the future, but they got some things right. They admitted that they knew there would be no flying cars by 2015, but you gotta have them, right? I dug the positive vibes that were seen in the film's version of 2015. Have y'all seen Jaws 19 yet?The original picture never meant to get a sequel. It had so much success at the box office that there was no choice in the mind of the studio. Zemeckis would not return unless Fox and Lloyd were back. Funnily enough, Fox was not aware of the sequel until he saw the end credits which said the team would be back. Gale and Zemeckis came up with idea of time paradoxes which would allow them to go back to 1955 and see those events from a different light. There were some stumbling blocks. Crispin Glover did not return over money issues, so they decided to use Glover's likeness. He was angry and sued the producers. Now there are clauses in the SAG collective bargaining agreement that bans movies from using likenesses of actors without permission. That is a shame Glover could not return because he was part of the first film's magic. In addition, Claudia Wells who originally played Jennifer was replaced by Elizabeth Shue. They had to reshoot the first film's ending with the different actress. These are slight blemishes the team faced trying to get the film produced. In order to be more cost effective, they shot this and the third film back-to-back. It was not a wild success at the box office, but it was still made some decent financial returns.The film truly excels with the production design and visual effects. Rick Carter wanted to give the film a darker look, something deeper than the typical Blade Runner look. I loved how they created 2015 and the alternate 1985 world. For this particular film, ILM entered digital compositing and using the motion control camera system for the first time. This allowed camera movement in one of the more complex scenes where Fox portrayed three characters at once (in a really humorous sequence). In the 2015 world, we can play that game ""was it invented or was it not?"" I think they have a good track record in what inventions the film displayed when compared to reality.The sequel picks up right where the original film ended with Marty (Michael J. Fox), Doc (Christopher Lloyd), and Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) going to 1985 to help Marty's and Jennifer's children. When they completed what they needed to do, they return to their time...but it is not quite how they left it. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) owns a bigshot casino and is married to Marty's mom, Lorraine (Lea Thompson). Marty finds out that his dad died years before. Doc concludes that Biff used a sports almanac from the future to bet on sports scores to amass his fortune. Apparently, future Biff stole the DeLorean and went to his younger self with the almanac. Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to the school dance to retrieve the book. Marty cannot be seen by Doc's younger self. But if Marty is called a coward, even more trouble may arise.The film is paced by Fox's and Lloyd's frenetic energy. There is more screwball comedy, but they keep the same energy possessed in the first film. I love when Chris Lloyd goes over-the-top as Doc. If you find yourself lost by any plot points, the performances should at least keep you grounded. I was very interested in Wilson's portrayal as the many Biffs seen throughout. One thing for sure, he knows how to keep Biff an unlikable character.I'm glad Back to the Future Part II is getting more love today. It is not a great nor original as the first film. Does it have it to be? It was nice just being back in the same world as these beloved characters. The plot can be borderline incomprehensible at times, but the characters make up for that especially with an added screwball element. The visual effects and production design take advantage of the latest technology to create memorable images. Robert Zemeckis created a magical franchise. And do I need to say anything about Alan Silvestri's fantastic score?My Grade: B+",Soundtrack Quality
"The BTTF movies, I think, should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of ""time travel."" BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ""defines"" a role as few have been defined in films. Plus Thomas Wilson as the various Tannen characters, his great characterizations are too easily taken for granted.The Delorean time machine Doc created is the ""vehicle"" that supports three unique stories in the Trilogy. Most of the ""science"" in the 3 films is ""bad science"", which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a ""science"" explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.In part I, while helping Doc test the time machine in an empty mall parking lot at 2AM, Marty quite accidentally goes back to 1955, to a time where Doc had just discovered the flux capacitor and Marty's eventual parents were to get together at the big high school dance. When Lorraine, again accidentally, gets a crush on Marty he has to repair things to keep from changing his future.In Part II Marty and Doc have to travel to 2015 to keep the future kids out of trouble but a 78-yr-old Biff gets a sports almanac and steals the time machine to give it to his 18-yr-old self in 1955. The resultant gambling and wealth changed history for the worse and Marty and Doc had to use detective work and cunning to set things straight.In part III Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate.To me, thre is no value in judging which of the three movies is ""better"". Each one uses the main characters to create three distinctly different stories. I like to look at them as one long 3-part movie and we periodically watch all three on successive nights. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.In 2015 I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound.",Soundtrack Quality
"I know it's hard for any sequel to live up to the original. Yes, the first 'Back to the Future' film is definitely the best, but - come on - as far as sequels go, 'Parts II & III' are still pretty impressive. I know they may not have the same 'original feel' to them, but they at least to a fantastic job of expanding the original concept/mythology and growing the much-loved characters we met in the first outing.I doubt there are many people who will decide to watch 'Part III' of a trilogy first, so my advice is watch them all in order. Then you can experience the full magic of watching a young high school student (Marty McFly - played perfectly by Michael J Fox) get caught up in with his friend 'Doc Brown's' (played by the only person seemingly capable of upstaging Michael J Fox here - Christopher Lloyd) exploits with a time-travelling DeLorean carThere's a brief recap at the beginning of the film as to how our heroes have become stuck in the past and now they have to go further back to the Wild West in order to get home - don't worry, if that sounds confusing - it all makes sense if you've watched all three.What you have here is a movie that feels totally at home in the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, but this time is set among cowboys and spittoons. It delights in poking fun of the time period and genre, plus gives us familiar faces/enemies in the form of series antagonist 'Biff Tannen's' long lost grandfather as a murderous outlaw - naturally hell-bent on causing all sorts of problems for our heroes. Plus we even have a love interest for Doc - which does add a new dimension to the story. Normally if a new character is introduced so late it feels a bit jarring - I'm glad to say that here the insertion of 'Clara Clayton' feels organic and a necessity to the overall story.You may not love it as much as the first, you may also consider this (or the second) to be the 'weakest' in the series, but even if that's true - it's still fantastic family entertainment. There are few films that can be considered 'timeless' (especially those made today), but the 'Back to the Future' trilogy can still be enjoyed by the whole family and holds up as it ever did (even if it did fail to predict what 2015 would look like and many of us are still waiting for hover boards and Nike self-lacing trainers!).'Rick and Morty' may be cool, but they'll never be as well-loved as those they are spoofing. Long may the 'Back to the Future' trilogy never be remade/rebooted/whatever. 'Part III' may only be an 8/10, but overall the series will always remain a 'perfect 10.'",Western Genre
"Having set a new standard in time travel films with Back To The Future and Back To The Future Part II, it was with eager anticipation that I looked forward to seeing if Robert Zemeckis could bring his trilogy to a satisfying conclusion.  To conclude any trilogy in a successful manner some of the key ingredients you need are:  1. do something in your wrap up you haven't done before 2. keep the main characters true to what they have been previously 3. tie up all the loose threads and 4. give us a satisfying ending.For this third outing in the series, Zemeckis takes us where we have yet to tread, that being 1885 Hill Valley.  With Marty trapped once again in the year 1955, he enlists the 1955 Doc Brown to help him return home.  As we know by now, things are never that simple when it comes to Marty and Doc. Marty has no magic ruby slippers to click together three times and say, ""There's no place like home.""  It seems Doc ended up in the Old West, but hid the DeLorean in a cave for Marty to find some 70 years later so he may return home back to 1985 and destroy the time machine.  After discovering that Doc met with some misfortune shortly after arriving in 1885 Hill Valley, Marty decides to travel back in time to rescue him. 
While BTTFIII does not have the break neck frantic pace of Part II, it is a good film on its own.  For the first time, Zemeckis slows things down a bit, making this third film straightforward, yet just as delightful in a lot of ways as the other films.  The first thing he does is throw us a little change up.  Zemeckis and Gale decide to center the complications of this third film around Doc Brown by having him fall unexpectedly in love with a school teacher by the name of Clara(Mary Steenburgen).  In essence, Doc loses his head over a woman and loses his scientific reasoning in the process.  It is left up to Marty to become the voice of reason when Doc begins to let his emotions rule his reactions.  Yet, Marty seems as a amused as we are by the whole thing.  This is one romance that could easily have been the downfall of this film, but thanks to the performances of Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd, together they develop a chemistry that makes it all work and work to perfection.  So by having the majority of the film take place in the old west, then introducing something to the plot we didn't expect, Zemeckis takes care of the first point I mentioned above. 
There's also the matter of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. The meanest, grimiest, filthiest, most ruthless outlaw to ever inhabit Hill Valley.  If you liked Thomas F. Wilson's portrayals of Biff, you'll be amazed at his rambunctious portrayal of Mad Dog.  He even somehow manages to top his villainous portrayals in the first two films which is not an easy task.  So yes, all the characters from the first two films are here in some form or another, and though Doc Brown may be in love, he is still the Doc.  This solidly takes care of my second point about keeping the characters true to what they have been before.Zemeckis and Gale have been absolute geniuses in writing these films.  In each film they have taken little pieces from the previous films and make them essential to what's happening.  For instance, if you've seen the second part there is a short scene that is extremely relevant to what goes on in the finale.  When originally viewing it in Part II, I'm sure you never gave it a second thought.  When the pay off comes in this film, you can't help but chuckle and say, oh I see.  As for my third point about tying up loose ends, they do that and tie up some things we didn't even know were loose ends.In Part II, it was necessary for several of the actors to play different roles.  This one is no different.  Besides being Marty Mcfly, Fox also portrays his ancestor Shamus Mcfly, who is Irish, and again Fox shows his versatility as Lea Thompson does as his wife Maggie.  Of course James Tolkan is back as Strickland and theres a couple of good jokes about his character that will surprise you...well at least one of them will surprise you the other will just leave you laughing.  As if all this wasn't good enough, Zemeckis also gives us several old western character actors, Dub Taylor, Pat Buttram, and Harry Carey Jr. Another great touch thrown in just for the fun of it.In reviewing the fist two parts of the trilogy, I failed to mention Alan Silvestri's terrific score.  All three films owe a great deal of their success to it, and the fact that he was able to keep the same theme, yet do variations on it that perfectly fitted each film deserves as much credit as all the others responsible for making this film received.So what about point 4, a satisfying ending?  Of course, you'll have to see the film to find out for yourself.  I can only say that when Part 3 was over I felt a certain amount of sadness that the trilogy had ended.  Even now when I watch the three films, I wish there had been a fourth, and a fifth. This was not because the ending of the third film left me unsatisfied in anyway, quite the contrary in fact.  It was because I would miss not only the films themselves, but most of all the rich detail and characterizations brought to life for us by a wonderful cast, director, writers and the rest of the crew responsible for enabling us to enjoy one of the most memorable series of films ever. And when you live in my memory forever, you get my grade.  For Back To The Future Part III it's an A+. As for the trilogy, there is no grade high enough, no rating high enough, for me to give it the award it so richly deserves.",Soundtrack Quality
"Picking up where #2 left off, Marty is stuck in 1955 again and has to explain to the 1955 Doc why he's back and uses a letter Doc sends him from 1885 to explain what happened. After fixing up the time machine (hidden in a from 1885 cave), they find out that  Doc is murdered in the past by Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (played by Thomas F. Wilson) ""over a matter of $80 dollars."" So Marty decides to go back and rescue Doc before the murder can occur, but he is bedeviled by a rip in the fuel line - meaning they have to find another way to get the time machine to hit 88 miles per hour - and Doc falling in love with school teacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). Along the way, he gets advice both from Doc and his 1885 ancestor Seamus McFly (also played by Michael J. Fox) that he should really learn to control his temper.Fox and Lloyd are fun to watch as always, and I give my hat off to the studio for hiring Mary Steenburgen as Doc's love interest and not some super model type; it's more fitting of who Doc is. Wilson's Biff Tannen officially became a traditional ""villain"" in #2 with him murdering George McFly, and now Wilson plays an even bigger villain in Buford Tannen, whom he makes both funny and menacing.Ironically, Wilson is said to be a very nice man in real life. Leah Thompson makes the most of a thankless dual role as both Lorraine McFly and Marty's great, great grandmother Maggie McFly, and James Tolkan plays his Principal character's soft spoken law man ancestor (killed in a deleted scene by Buford Tannen; ""Remember son... discipline."")It should be noted that originally there were no sequels planned with the first movie; that bit with Doc taking Marty and Jennifer to the future to help their kids was just another gag. But the film was such a hit that the studio couldn't NOT do sequels, so this one and part 2 were filmed back to back, which is becoming more of a craze these days.Although on the surface it's a lighthearted comedy about time travel, it's also about what it means to be a man. The first film defined being a man through violently standing up to your tormentors, while this film and #2 go with the theme that being a man also means you have to reign yourself in when people start annoying you. Marty' willingness to fight back was his strength in the first film but here it is his flaw, as people in both 2015, 1955 and 1885 continually get his goat. The message of self-control is bluntly stated when Doc says to Marty ""You can' t keep going off the handle every time someone calls you a name, that's why you get into that accident in the future!"" (referring of course to the car accident mentioned in part 2). It is not until Marty realizes his error when he's about to meet Buford in the gun fight that he achieves this ideal and, much to Seamus's glee, says of Buford and the opinions surrounding him ""He's an asshole! I don't care what Tannen says, and I don't care what anyone else says either!"" Because of this, he is able to avoid said accident.Also loaded with gags, references to other great westerns (""My name is Clint Eastwood."") and Doc's response to being asked if his hijacking the train is a hold up: ""It's a science experiment!""",Western Genre
"Underrated doesn't deserve the hate. Back to the Future Part III is so unappreciated. I keep hearing from people how bad this film is. Am I the only one who enjoyed this film? It is not a masterpiece like the first one is but it is a tied with the first one and it is a great sequel a great end to an excellent trilogy. Back to the Future is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I love the first film to death and it is a masterpiece and I love this (the third film) to death. Back to the Future Part III in my opinion it is tied with the first one and it is one of the best sequels of all time. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy in my opinion it is better than Part II I have enjoyed it more than Part II.Michael J. Fox , Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen are excellent at acting I have enjoyed their performances. Robert Zemeckis writes and directs excellent this sequel. Alan Silvestri writes a beautiful score for third film which it was shot back to back with the second film. I Love the new score for this movie. Back to the Future Part III (1990)I love that this film was set in the Old West back in 1885. I love the rescue mission in which Marty goes back in time from the year 1955 back in to the past in to the Old West to save his best friend Doc Brown from getting killed by an outlaw Buford Tannen. I love western movies and Marty McFly was naming him self as Clint Eastwood in this film which it was brilliant. They even make similarity from A Fistful of Dollars (one of my all time favorite western films) in which Marty wears a boiler plate as a bullet proof vest in which Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) shoots Marty. This movie has comedy, adventure, action, bank robbery, train robbery, gun fights, fist fights and one explosion. Great acting from the actors, great direction and great writing, great score. This movie shows group of Indians, followed closely by Cavalry men who are chasing them. Doc saves Marty just before he would be hang by Buford and his men. I did like that the film was more focusing on Doc and Marty the characters that we care about. Rather then Loraine and Biff like Part II did. The movie wasn't dark like the second was. I love how Doc and Marty pushes the DeLorean along the spur line, on the tracks attempting to get it up to 88 miles per hour. DeLorean then reaches 88mph and disappears...with the locomotive barreling over the side of the ravine, and exploding in a huge fireball, brilliant and well done special effect. I love that the movie does not messes with the first two movies and it is an original film I appreciate that. It is Rated PG for language, sensuality and violence. It is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy I love, love this film to death and doesn't deserve the hate. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval a perfect score for me.",Western Genre
"And here comes the conclusion of one of the finest and most likable cinematic trilogies: ""Back to the Future Part III"", more than a sequel, a resourcing in the spirit that made the first film such an endearing classic, with an even more escapist value in the setting, the Far West during the 1880's. As a Sci-Fi Family Romantic Comedy, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is already a winner, but the Western is the defining aspect of its originality. ""Back to the Future Part III"" was directly made after the second, basically recycling the same material, and using the same team, the same casting etc. The continuity between the two films is so determining that there's no way watching the second without getting immediately to the third, it's like keeping in touch with the same family. Indeed, as much as I can watch the first one alone, because it's a class on its own and a film I consider slightly independent from the two sequels, on the other hand, I consider the sequels too connected to each other not to be seen in a row. This continuity helps to appreciate the second part that feels more like a link between the two other films while ""Part III"" resurrects the spirit of the first one by focusing on the emotionality rather than the eternal ""back to the future"" mission.This has always been Marty's preoccupation and the thrust of the trilogy but the travels also had the merit to solve some familial issues and help a beloved character to improve something in his life, if anything, the trilogy defines the notion of 'coming-of-age' as the inspirational aspect of the film, its encouragement for success through self-improvement. But since people were facing less materialistic issues than during the 80's, I guess there was a need to take some distance from these so-called philosophies of successes and a huge step back one century earlier when the 80's followed the Secession War and preceded the Industrial Revolution that would lead to demise of the frontier spirit. The Far West is less a setting or an era, than a state of mind, embodying the roots of the American spirit in its purest form, before greed and profit perverted its meaning. The Far West setting perfectly fitted the tormenting desire of Doc Emmett Brown for retirement and a tacit existential quest for love.Consequently, while the central character of the first film was George McFly and the second part focused on the McFly Family, Gale and Zemeckis took the last film as a great opportunity to enrich the character of Doc Brown and close his story's arc through a love story in order to replace the ""mad scientist"" label by a necessary element of three-dimensionality. On the surface, Marty's mission is to prevent Brown from being killed by the villain who ���for our greatest delight- is Biff's ancestor, Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, but while Marty and Doc try to find a solution to push the DeLorean to 88 mph, destiny puts them in Clara's path. So Doc meets Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), a teacher whose fate was to fall in the Shonash ravine canyon and give it a posthumous name.At that point of the trilogy, we're all aware of the time travels' mechanisms, we can even be surprised by Marty's incapability ""to reason fourth-dimensionally"", who he traveled so much. But here, the film invites us to put all the scientific stuff into perspective and think of the real elements that predefine our fates. There's a strong philosophical material hidden behind the love story as the film concludes its approach on time travels with the idea that nothing is written except by our free will and our capacity not to let external elements direct our lives. But I may make the film sound too intellectual when it's also a great comedy and one hell of a western.The film is the opportunity to rediscover and say goodbye to the wonderful characters of Hill Valley, to see the first McFlys in American land, to witness the inauguration of the clock tower which, as Doc said, was fitting that he and Marty could witness, not to mention Marty pretending to be named Clint Eastwood, at the risk of tarnishing this name by becoming the biggest yellow belly in the Old West. And the delight on the comedic level is in the way the humor works on a meta-referential level as if the film was breaking an imperceptible fourth wall, playing on its own trademarks. I can't resist to the scene where Marty, realizing that he might be killed instead of Doc utters a ""Great Scott"" followed by Doc's comment ""I know this is heavy"", when Marty wonders why they always have to ""cut these things so damn close"" or when, in the most dramatic situations, he reacts by an ironic 'perfect'.And speaking of dramatic, the film also provides great thrilling moments you'd expect from a Western, and probably the most heart-pounding climax from the trilogy with the train sequence, so suspenseful, I remember I had to pause for seconds the first time I watched it. This was one of the few times, I needed to take a break because it was just too suspenseful, but what a fitting and rewarding conclusion. Action, escapism, duels, stage, rides, Indians, cavalry, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is also an independent homage to the Western genre with some exhilarating moments, served by Alan Silvestri's terrific score, probably his best work in the trilogy.And this is why I consider ""Back to the Future"" as the greatest trilogy after ""The Godfather"" with a slight advantage that remains the consistency in terms of spirit, thrills, laughs and emotional value. So thank you Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and all the team for these three unforgettable classics!",Western Genre

"Other than Doctor Emmett Brown's character development, and it having some relevance to the previous films, it's pretty fair to say Back to the Future Part 3, was a cash grab. The concept is pretty strung on, with a story pulled out of left field, to keep the series going for one more round. Part 3 was supposed to be apart of Part 2, but they figured with the duration, and content, they had two films on their hands. Maybe because I'm not the biggest western guy, but other than Part 3 being the funniest of the bunch, it didn't pack the punch the other films did. The story may come off a little light, but Part 3 finds it's footing, coming off a jumbled Part 2. Zemeckis, Spielberg & Gale didn't add as much time traveling, keeping the narrative focused, like the first.Michael J. Fox continues his bold, yet charming role, but he didn't have much character development, due to the fact that he didn't have much to do in this film. The standout of the film was Doc! He got the most screen time as of yet, getting some interesting pieces added to his character. The greatest thing about this film, was the chemistry Fox & Llyod built over this short, five year span. Mary Steenburgen was a rare pleasure of someone who plays a sudden love for a main character. Clara was a great compliment to Doctor Brown, helping expand his character. Thomas F. Wilson returns once again, to be our antagonist, but his role is pretty outplayed already.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale, had the same charm, and familiar lines from the films prior. With the western spin on it, it helped make this film the funniest out of the trilogy.The production design by Rick Carter, who also did the design for Back to the Future Part 2, looked great, while really capturing that western feel. Part 3 was less reliant on the effects, other than the time travel scenes, really. The costume design by Joanna Johnston & Chuck Velasco had that great western feel, but the costumes stood too clean, for a dirty, dusty film.",Western Genre
"Marty and doc are back, but in another time. They go to the West in 1885 in order to save Doc's life and from then on the Western adventure takes place. It's a pity that so many people disliked the third movie because, in my humble opinion, it's a great finale to this fantastic trilogy. It is very well written with rich characters and clever dialogues. This third part does differ in the sense that it's set in the West and has less of the futuristic gadgets and gizmos (obviously, since it's not set in the distant future but you'll still see a few including a time-travelling freight train) but it still retains the same energy, a different kind of action and it pays a nice homage to Western classics. Fox and Lloyd continue their roles of the teen hero and the crazy doctor (and it never gets old) but this time there's a new female lead. Mary Steenburgen delivers a hilariously wonderful performance as the ditsy Clara. She and Lloyd are funny and sweet together. Clara is the perfect lady for Doc and Steenburgen fits the part like a glove. This time, Lea Thompson appears as an Irish settler. Zemeckis has brilliantly picked up from where the second one ended. The film ends on a delightful note and I would have liked to see more 'Back to The Future' movies. But, I'm still very pleased with the way it is. There have been only very few trilogies that have impressed me overall. My list includes names like Ray's 'Apu Trilogy' and Coppola's 'Godfather' trilogy and of course Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' movies.",Western Genre
"When I first saw Back To The Future part 2, I was really looking forward to see the third part because it's the exact sequel of the second. In fact, Back To The Future part 2 has no end in itself. You have to see the last part of the trilogy to know the end of the adventure. That's why I saw the third part just after the second =D.In this movie the main character, the young Marty McFly (Michael J.Fox), has to go back to 1885 in order to find his long-time friend and eminent scientist Emmett Brown. Doc has been accidentally sent to the old Far West at the end of the second movie and this film tells Marty's journey to find his friend and go back to the present.I am really fond of the first two movies so I had a little apprehension about this one. I was afraid I might be bored or disappointed. But this is a really good film too. The universe is kind of different because the action takes place a century before so it isn't boring at all. Moreover, even if the characters are involved in a cowboys story, they're still themselves and I am still crazy about them. They fit perfectly in their role and, as in the other movies, Marty meets some people of his family. He meets some bad guys too, and the worst is part of Biff Tannen's family, as usual.My favorite scene happens at the end, just before Marty and Doc finally go back home. They really are in trouble because Buff Tannen, Biff's ancestor, wants to shoot them and Marty uses a trick he learned in the previous movie. I like this sort of links between the parts of the trilogy very much.I really love this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who saw the first ones. Not only is the plot as good and funny as usual, but there has been a really good effort in the camera-work to make the film look like a classic western.This is really a cult movie in the Sci-Fi world and in my opinion, it's a shame there haven't been other sequels. There's never too much Back To The Future and you never get enough !",Western Genre
"With this passing month, I have seen all three ""Back to the Future"" films for the very first time in my life. Now, I have seen many tiny pieces (I believe everyone has), enough to the point that if another film or show references ""Back to the Future"", I completely catch it. I must say, however, that there are very few trilogies on the planet that add up to such mesmerizing films as these. There are only four trilogies I love, and the list goes along like this: ""The Lord of the Rings"", the original ""Star Wars"" films, all three of ""The Matrix"" films, and now this. Believe me, readers: you will never find something as excellent as these three films about the curiosity of time travel being invented. I must admit that I was quite reluctant by the trailer for this film at the end of ""Back to the Future: Part II"", but I admire this one to an extent that surpasses the second film by far.For this third chapter in the saga, Marty McFly heads back in time to pick-up the Doc. At the moment, the Doc is trapped in a western time period, thus forcing Marty to create a new identity; Clint Eastwood. That's right. For the third time in the series, Marty and Doc must head back to the future . . .The first noteworthy thing to tell you is that this film may also be one of the greatest science-fiction AND western films ever created. It was definitely a brilliant idea to carry the story to the past this time round; otherwise, ""Part III"" could have been a failed re-treading of the first two ""Back to the Future"" films.The acting in this film is--simply put--heartfelt and endearing. The audience could swear that all three films were shot back-to-back, and that adds so much more to the series. We have also acquired the same charm of humor and action blended that the prior films had presented us with. There is not one single performance in the entire film that is lackluster; all of these actors shine brightly in these roles, much as they always did previously.The writing of dialogue and action setpieces in the film are so enveloping and epic, especially towards the close of the film. It's extraordinary in so many ways. I think the most appealing thing about the film is how it self-references itself continuously throughout the films. Self-referencing, as I stated earlier, is very charming, and it makes the audience feel so much more at home with the tale and characters. This film gives us a well-executed message about life, and I think this is one point of a plus that makes the film so joyful and welcoming. This film, besides being set in the past (nearly a hundred years before the eighties, to be exact), is more about our individual futures as human beings. This idea, in turn, is so very rare to see in filmography that you cannot help but praise the film with applause. Phenomenal.One very shocking revelation is the set itself: it looks like a real town in REAL western time periods. I actually had a double-take at how detailed some props and areas looked in the film. It is absolutely beautiful, especially when we see the many mountain ranges of this desert.As always, the soundtrack adds a childhood feeling to the film; that feeling you get when you are so familiar with a certain object that it brings this deep joy and empathy to your heart.With one last major compliment in the film's favor, I have to mention that when the film closed, I had the biggest smile on my face than I have had in quite a while. It is the kind of smile I believe everyone gets at the end of ""Star Wars"", or ""The Lord of the Rings"", or ""It's a Wonderful Life"". This film deserves every title of excellency it has received over the many years since its release.My rating for ""Back to the Future: Part III"" is a nine-out-of-ten stars.Merry Christmas, and God bless!",Western Genre

"I call The Back to the Future movies a trilogy set that was something a lot like the original ""Star Wars"" movies, and they made ""Back to the Future Part III"" a great part in all of this. ""Back to the Future Part III"" was practically an old-west situation with a good amount of science-fiction and humor through the whole thing.Through all of this, you're expecting to see someone get shot and killed in the old west, yet Marty is constantly beating the bad guys. I especially like the ending in the old-west, where Marty has everyone thinking he has been shot and killed by Biff Tannen, then he gets up and simply beats him up having him unconscious, disgusted, and even inadvertently helps with Tannen's arrest. This is a dream for nearly everyone to do to a bully at some point.Watch the whole set of ""Back to the Future"" movies side by side and you will find all of them, fun and amusing.",Western Genre
"It seems that a lot of people rate Part III quite low, even those who like the underrated Part II. This may be because the break-neck pace of Part II is gone and this last entry mellows out and takes its time to develop its own story while also fully resolving the huge 130-year adventure of the entire trilogy. If it were a 90-minute cash-in I would understand why some people are indifferent towards Part III, but it's so much more than that.You could argue that Part III is almost a remake of the first movie. In several ways this is true, but it also has the appeal that makes the first so endearing. Instead of being nostalgic for the naive 80s or innocent 50s, Part III makes us long for the wide-open spaces of the old west, when the US was still in its infancy, before skyscrapers, shopping malls, and Starbucks lined every horizon. A time when there was still real freedom. But with freedom comes anarchy, this time taking the form of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen - fastest gun in the west.I will admit that there is a noticeable lack of excitement as Doc romances Clara Clayton which goes against the ever-escalating disaster suspense of the series and might not interest viewers who are not keen period love stories. The action and adventure takes a back seat here while romance, comedy, and clever plotting get their own space. On the flipside Alan Silvestri delivers his most exciting score for the series, fusing the BTTF theme with a rousing western melody which is especially fun during the climax on the train. Plus, it's always fun to see 1955 Doc, who I always thought was more eccentric and closer to insanity than his older counterpart.We also get to see the ""birth"" of the clock tower which is a nice counterpoint to it's ""death"" in the first movie. Part III also opens with the brilliant lightning strike and Doc's rudely interrupted celebration, which is just awesome.Yes, it does have its shortcomings, I won't deny that. Why doesn't Doc just syphon the gasoline from the DeLorean he came to 1885 in? It would save them the effort of hijacking a train. But I am being pedantic again. I always felt that Part III was a definitive and fitting end to the series and I never thought that a Part IV would be necessary.

"Marty gets to 1885 to save Doc, but they may be stuck there and the clock is ticking on getting back. This one does follow the other two, but it doesn't relate that directly to them(except for tying up loose ends Part II left for it so it'd have *something*), other than referencing the first one somewhat(much less than the second did). It's not at a high school comedy, nor a carefully written homage to the original, it's a Western adventure with time travel. The core concept remains the same, if messing up the time-line seems less dangerous this time around(and in general it doesn't feel as exciting as the others). The focus is on Emmett now, and with little story left to tell, they give him a love interest. Tannen remains the villain, and is the only one left to really overact(except for Lloyd, the mug-master), not to mention one of the only to return. We do get the trilogy treatment, with this returning to the roots and revealing information we didn't know before and a sense of closure. The humor is again pretty silly, in fact maybe moreso than earlier. As a period piece, it really works, you believe that you're seeing early US. I recommend this to fans of the franchise. 7/10",Western Genre
"This is the point where the dam breaks for the BTTF trilogy. Without the innocent, loose grasp of reality present in the first film, nor the amusing, campy glimpses of the future seen in the second, there's really not all that much to look forward to as this bad western lolls its way toward the finish line. Marty McFly and Doc Brown still make for strong core characters, ones we desperately want to see come out ahead, but they've got their arms full here with a stale set of recurring gags, a base premise that's thin at best and a hammy love story that doesn't really bring anything meaningful to the table. Where the original was able to effortlessly skirt the holes that speckled its plot, the saga's grand finale bowls straight through them with no regard for the repercussions, leaving audiences skeptical. A needless leap across both genre and era, at least it has the dignity to close the door behind it when the credits queue.",Western Genre
"After the Doc is sent back to the old west Marty (Fox) finds the 1955 Doc for help to travel to 1885 to save his future self from assassination.The third and final instalment to the time travelling trilogy brings around a western adventure for the coolest time traveller of all Marty McFly as he attempts to save the Doc's life.In 1985 back to the future brought around a sensational new concept of travelling back and forth and altering past events and with the coolest car on the market was a worldwide smash and rightly so. And only being 2 when this was released, I feel I missed the appreciation to the climax of a truly brilliant series.Still praised to this very day the conclusion has more action, drama and adventure than the previous two parts and adapting a western styled genre gives the series diversity whilst still maintaining a powerful segment devoted to science.As Marty and the Doc contemplate returning back to the present in 1985 numerous factors arise to cause problems for their future. Mad Dog wants their lives whilst a love interest for the Doc appears, deflecting his attention from the present as he contemplates his own future.Having focused purposefully on Marty's family for the previous two films it was a nice gesture to focus in more on the doc's life and outlook and as a result this feels more rewarding and the entire trilogy benefits from spreading its emotions through its main players. Even Tannen has some purposeful and meaningful dialogue in this script which is also beneficial as the film winds up.Encoding more action sequences than ever Part III adds the intensity and power to give the western scenes extra spice. From shoot outs to a splendid train/car experiment this feels none stop and your heart will pump for more, yet sadly the fun and adventure had to finish somewhere and is the case with life, it is always good to go out on a high.Michael J Fox once more generates a slick styled protagonist with his clever mimics of Clint somebody and though the first costume design is far-fetched he somehow carries it off. Lloyd's Doc is once more exceptionally intelligent and knowledgeable and having extra dialogue and on screen time we see a more human side to his personality.This trilogy reinvented the concept of travelling through time with a complex intent but never degrading the audience with its basic yet eccentric styled discourse and with such superb characters and intent of action with humour this trilogy has astounded many and will do for all of time.",Western Genre
"The third & final instalment in Back to the Future Trilogy, Part III is by all means a much welcome improvement over Part II, and manages to regain the fresh vibe & riveting quality of the original by bringing the delights of a different genre into its sci-fi premise. Picking up from the cliffhanging ending of its muddled predecessor, it is closer in tone to the first film and concludes the trilogy on a satisfying note.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film takes Marty & Doc further than ever before and features a better structured & more refined storyline with a finale that brings the journey full circle. Although there are a few empty stretches in the middle, its Old West setting, homages to western classics & deft use of humour derived from merging the two contrasting genres results in an entry that feels new yet familiar.The time-travel antics are as fun as before while the century old timeline actually suits the story more than the poorly rendered vision of the future. The finale also unravels with same thrilling, nail-biting intensity as the climax of the first feature. And detailed set pieces, dynamic camerawork, steady pace, deftly choreographed action & excellent performances from the cast keep the adventurous aura alive n kicking.Overall, Back to the Future Part III is a fitting conclusion to the adventures of Doc & Marty, and aptly ties up all the loose ends before turning off the lights. The last scene does feel unnecessary to the equation but its presence does not undermine the emotional impact of what occurred before by much. It's pretty much the same ending either way. Expertly crafted, intelligently told & finely acted, Part III wraps up the Back to the Future saga on a memorable note.",Western Genre
"While it doesn't have quite the same ingenuity and vitality that made the first two parts such great entertainment, the third and final part of the excellent Back to the Future trilogy still offers two hours of solid entertainment. The first part saw our heroes go back into the past slightly, and the second part saw us travel into the future; so to be different, this one finds us massively in the past, in the great Wild West. What follows is a mixture of various western tributes (some of which are blatantly obvious, others less so) combined with a fun, if slightly predictable, plot line. Marty McFly has had to travel back to 1885 in order to save Doc Brown, whom Marty has discovered will die on Monday if he doesn't do something about it. With the space time continuum in disarray, Marty must struggle to save Doc Brown from a notorious gunman known as MadDog (who looks suspiciously like Biff from the other two films) while also making sure that he doesn't change anything as it will have serious repercussions on his future. That's the future from 1985 onwards, not the 1895 one. I think.For a trilogy of films predominantly aimed at children, this has one hell of a confusing plot. Luckily, however, through tight scripting and a nice plot pace; Robert Zemeckis tells his story well, and even if you're not sure of the plot line on the whole, it's always obvious what's immediately going on. The film features a number of nice set-pieces (much like the other two) and there honestly isn't a moment of down time in the entire film (or trilogy, for that matter). As you might expect, the best set-piece has saved until the end; and the train chase climax blends tension, suspense and humour to ensure that the film ends on a high. The characters are well done and entertaining throughout, and both the leads; Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd were born to play the roles that they play in this film. Both have made other movies, but neither one has even come close to being as memorable as they are here; and that reinforces my point. On the whole, this is a worthy climax to a very fine trilogy and it should please everyone who sees it!",Western Genre
"I loved the first film, and while a step down I enjoyed the second as well. The third film is tremendous fun from start to finish, and contrary to what the other reviewers say I prefer this over the second. Yes the storyline is mediocre in places, but Doc's romance was touching and the steam-train finale was phenomenally staged. The film is set in the Old West and gives the stars a chance to revel in the situations that made the matin��e western serials such a delight for so many people. The script is as witty and clever as the ones in the first two films, the direction is once again excellent and I loved the casting of the old western favourites such as Harry Carey Jnr and Pat Buttram. And as always Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are on cracking form as Marty and Doc. Overall, despite the occasionally mediocre story, this is a worthy end to a great trilogy. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Western Genre
"The first movie, Back to the Future, had successfully blended Sci-Fi and high school drama to give us a heart-warming little tale. This movie does an equally good job of taking Sci-Fi to the wild west. The previous movie had ended with Doc being accidentally transported to 1985. Marty takes the help of 1955-Doc again, to bring 1985-Doc back to the present day(1985).What follows is a fun-filled adventure. Marty meets his ancestors. Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, an ancestor of Biff's, is a dreaded outlaw. A forefather of Principal Strickland is the town Marshal. There are gunfights, duels, Indians, Fedoras, chasing trains on horses, rescuing of a damsel and romance. The film pays tribute to the great westerns of the past. Marty adopts the name Clint Eastwood when he meets his ancestors. Like in some of the classic westerns, this film too has the plot-line where an outsider (time-traveler in this case) comes to a lawless town and teaches them, by setting a example, that violence is no good.The trilogy on the whole does a great job with time-travelling and alternate time-lines. There are a total of fifteen known time-journeys, three alternate 1885's, four alternate 1955's, four alternate 1985's, one 2015 we see and one which is yet to be made and zero plot-holes, in all the three films combined. What makes it even more special is that none of it is complicated. That is how story-telling ought to be.It is a one-of-a-kind time-travel trilogy. A must watch for film aficionados and casual movie-watchers alike.",Western Genre
"Seeing as how the science-fiction and the Western are my favorite genres, one would expect ""Back to the Future: Part III"" to be my personal favorite of the entire trilogy directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. It has some very fine moments and some great ideas in its form, but unfortunately, ""Part III"" comes across as being the weakest of the entire trilogy for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it lacks the zest and gusto that so wonderfully induced the first two movies.After Doc (Christopher Lloyd) is accidentally whisked back to 1885, Marty (Michael J. Fox) discovers the flux capicator-inhibited DeLorean buried in Hill Valley's soil, buried by the Doc years ago before he was murdered by a notorious gunfighter (Thomas Wilson). Marty recovers the DeLorean and travels back to the Old West to rescue Doc, who has become smitten with a frantic schoolmarm (Mary Steenburgen), who was supposed to have died until they interfered.I think you can see what my first real complaint about ""Part III"" is. I suppose it was only a matter of time before the screenwriters made the mistake of throwing in a sappy love story for Doc when one was anything but necessary. The first two movies dealt with their romantic subplots with care and tender brilliance, but best of all, they strayed away from Doc. This character needed anything but a love interest. The romantic subplot is sappy, boring, uninteresting, and makes one roll one's eyes and look toward his watch, begging Zemeckis to move along with the more interesting stuff. And also, I'm sorry to say, Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen are a very awkward screen couple.""Part III"" also suffers because it simply does not have the same inexorable timing and suspense that made the first two movies so magical. Instead of whipping along, it plods along like a man dying in the heat of the sun. And the climax, which is once again drawn-out with suspense intended to build, comes across as dull and routine with tensions everywhere but on the rise. There is also, I'm sorry to say, a lot of hokey dialogue in the screenplay.Now, however, there *are* some good elements to ""Part III."" In fact, some of them are brilliant. The idea of Marty assuming the name of Clint Eastwood in the Old West is a fantastic idea and the obvious homage to the climax of ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is fun and smile-inducing. Performances are once again good. Michael J. Fox's performance is buttoned up and solid; Lloyd is funny when he's not being sappy as Doc; Thomas Wilson is once again sinister and convincing; Mary Steenburg turns out a solid, if whimsical performance, as the schoolmarm; and there are a lot of fun Western cameos by names such as Pat Buttram and Harry Carey, Jr. who can be seen playing poker in the saloon that plays prominently in the movie. All of these good, fun elements do save the movie from being a complete failure, but unfortunately they also make your heart sink as you realize that the rest of the movie falls short of them.Perhaps the change of direction was the fatal flaw of ""Back to the Future: Part III."" Perhaps the blend of the Western and science-fiction genres was too patchy and whimsical for it to work. And maybe Robert Zemeckis and his crew were running out of steam with this franchise. In the end, ""Part III"" is not really a very bad movie, but it is uncharacteristically dull and dry for a Robert Zemeckis movie and unlike the first two movies, is rather forgettable save for its few brilliant elements.",Western Genre
"This time McFly goes back to 1985 to save the Doc.It is my least favorite of the three movies but still very entertaining and a great ending to the series.I will first say what makes me like this movie less than the other two. It is mainly because in the first two movies I liked the interaction of him with his family and how it affects the present. This is missing in the second part. We still get to see his ancestors and get the first McFly born in America pee on Marty, but it is very short. It is also less of a sci fi and more of a western. Which is also what makes it the favorite of the three for my father who loves westerns since he was a kid!.But aside from this the movie is very good. We still get to see a lot of Marty and the Doc. Doc even gets a little romance in this movie. Mary Steenburgen was great as Clara and they had a good chemistry. Biff's ancestor is of course the villain here and again he is on wonderful. ""Clint Eastwood, what kind of a stupid name is that?!"". Also great action towards the end with the chasing of the train, was very exciting. The final scene is also awesome, just a right quotation to end this great series with.",Western Genre
"Bttf was the perfect balance between Action/Comedy/Sc-fi/Romance that I guess couldn't be replicated, so it almost feels like they split it up for to sequels, so Bttf 2 is an Action/Sci-fi and Bttf 3 is an Comedy/Romance and surprisingly, it works despite the cowboys.",Western Genre
"In an era where sequels often fall short of their predecessors, ""Back to the Future Part III"" stands as a delightful testament to creativity and storytelling. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, this final installment in the iconic trilogy transports us not just through time, but also to the rugged landscapes of the Wild West, where the charm of 1950s nostalgia meets cowboy grit.The film opens with a somber note as Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) learns of Doc Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) plight in 1885. Driven by a sense of loyalty and adventure, Marty embarks on a journey to rescue his friend from a fate he cannot escape. The narrative expertly intertwines action, humor, and heartfelt moments, establishing a rich tapestry that captures the essence of friendship and the weight of choices made across time.One of the most captivating aspects of this film is how it revitalizes the western genre. From the dusty streets of Hill Valley in the 1880s to the classic standoffs and saloon brawls, the film pays homage to the spirit of westerns while infusing it with the trademark comedy and cleverness of the franchise. The characters, from the relentless outlaw Buford Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) to the spirited Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), offer a refreshing take on the archetypes of the genre.The film shines with its stunning visuals and captivating score, maintaining the high production values that the series is known for. The juxtaposition of the futuristic DeLorean against the backdrop of horse-drawn carriages sparks a nostalgic yet adventurous yearning for simpler times, all while cleverly commenting on progress and innovation.At its core, ""Back to the Future Part III"" delves into deeper themes of love, sacrifice, and the human experience. Doc's burgeoning romance with Clara and Marty's determination to save him highlight the lengths to which we go for those we care about. This emotional depth resonates with audiences of all ages, making the film not just a thrilling ride but a profound experience that lingers long after the credits roll.In the grand tapestry of film history, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is often overshadowed by its predecessors, but it stands as a unique and vital piece of the trilogy. It boldly steps into uncharted territory, blending genres and enriching its characters in a way that feels both fresh and familiar. With every twist and turn, it reminds us that while the past is a fascinating place to visit, it's the connections we forge and the adventures we embark upon that truly define our journeys through time.Overall, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is more than just a closing chapter; it's a celebration of creativity, friendship, and the complexities of love-an unforgettable ride that proves that whether in the past or the future, the spirit of adventure never dies.",Western Genre
"I loved the previous two volumes of this series. Especially the second one surprised me by being able to keep the quality at the same level as the first one. Unfortunately, the third one didn't impress me personally as much as the previous two films. This is probably due to the change of setting to a western, which I didn't enjoy as much. With the previous films I was entertained all the time, but here unfortunately I was a bit bored at times and mostly I felt that it was not worth it. I didn't have some huge sense of closure to the trilogy when it was over. Unfortunately. I'm just giving my opinion. I wasn't that interested in the third installment and didn't have as much fun with it. For me, the weakest part of the trilogy. The change to western didn't suit me and I didn't find the plot as interesting as the previous films. Despite all that, it was a good movie. It was. I'm just saying that compared to its predecessors, it was weaker from my perspective.",Western Genre
"It's fair to say that BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III is the third and least of the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy; it's merely an average Hollywood comedy adventure movie with sci-fi flourishes, while the first two films in the trilogy were bona fide classics.The problem with this film is that the science fiction material is really limited to just the first twenty minutes. For most of the running time, this film is merely an ordinary western adventure which seems happy to run through all of the clich��s in the genre: there's the duel on the dusty screen, the gang of horse-riding villains, the showdowns in the saloon, the chases, and the unwanted romantic sub-plots. The inclusion of the Mary Steenburgen character was a particular reason I remember for disliking this film when I watched it as a kid.It's certainly not a bad film, although it seems worse when you compare it to the earlier films. Michael J. Fox remains good value even though he's only required to go through the motions this time, although Christopher Lloyd's acting goes beyond the boundaries of ham and becomes quite ridiculous. Still, at least the movie picks up for the extended train sequence at the climax, which doesn't disappoint and recaptures some of the old movie magic.",Western Genre
"the past has new aspect. and this fact is real seductive. because it is a special homage to the westerns and, in same measure, perfect scene for a nice, amusing and charming love story. the old clich��s of a classic genre are reinvented. the atmosphere of saloon, the malefactor, the innocent , the old maid and the hero , the sheriff and the friendship, the roots of the great Marty McFly who, from Calvin to Clint does a long travel , the energy and the humor and ZZ Top as the ideal spice , all as bricks of the most inspired final chapter of a series who remains memorable for its public. Robert Zemeckis , in the case of Back to the Future has the gift to be more than model of Emmett Brown because, after 25 years from its final shot, after 31 years after its born, the series remains the most comfortable and fast time machine.",Western Genre
"A fairly disappointing finale to the Back to the Future series. Being a big fan of the original I was interested how they would tie it all up. The film basically does two things to try and keep things fresh, firstly a return a change of location to the wild west and secondly introducing a love interest for Doc's character. The structure & some of the dialogue is nearly identical to the original, to the point it made me cringe at many times, I won't list all the things that were the same. The effect is the film does start to feel a bit repetitive & tired in places, as though they had found their formula and wouldn't change it. The original also tapped into the nostalgia of traveling back to 30 years ago, plenty of audience members from the 1980s could probably relate to and remember the 1950s. Obviously setting this film in the 1880s doesn't really have that same appeal. This isn't the real wild west either though of Red River and High Noon but a parody version. In the 1990s some real powerful westerns came out, Unforgiven, Tombstone, Dances with Wolves, in comparison this film just feels weak and whimsical.For me too there's also something a bit sad about seeing beloved characters age because the actors playing them have, both Elisabeth Shue & Michael J. Fox were approaching 30 when this came out but both are still meant to be the younger high school characters they were when the original was released. I'd have preferred if they could have matured the characters a little bit to catch up with the actors playing them.The fact that it made less money than either of it's predecessors was probably a sign it was the right time to end the franchise.The film has a few other flaws too, Marty must yell out everything he's thinking at every moment, Indians!, Cavalry! Bear! The Irish accents are not very good and there's really no point including these characters in the film, in the original Marty had to fix their relationship which was the heart of the film, no such luck here though, they're just kind of there. The jokes are also quite bad, Marty steps in horse dung, pee jokes, there's also so much that's unexplained like how is Marty suddenly such an expert horse rider? The love story is extremely cheesy too, it worked in the original because of the age of the characters you might believe they were that awkward and wide eyed but it doesn't work so well with the older characters.",Western Genre
"Once I saw each of these ""Back To The Future"" films on VHS, after viewing all of them earlier in the movie theaters, I wound up only keeping one: this one.This film - the third and final one in the ""Back To The Future"" series, didn't have the annoying bully ""Biff"" (except in a subservient role at the very end) and it had a nice western look and flavor to it. Yes, it's a little loud and the two main characters - ""Marty McFly"" (Michael J. Fox) and ""Dr. Emmetr Brown"" (Christopher Lloyd) mainly shout to each other (probably to hear over the noisy soundtrack!), but it's generally an enjoyable two hours of film with fun-type characters and a cool Old-West theme.Even the bad guy is kind of fun to watch. It also offers good humor and two pretty women, Mary Steenburgen and Elisabeth Shue. I loved the train scenes, too, which were beautiful.",Western Genre
"I enjoy groups of films, in a sort of ""mix tape"" way. Of particular interest are sequels and series where different writers and filmmakers are involved. I find the first three Frankenstein films differ in amazing ways for instance, ways that deepen the experience for each film.Here we have Spielberg clone Zemeckis in control of all three in the group. The first was apparently intended as a single project which had a risky creation, involving many changes. Some lack of coherence was introduced because of major changes introduced by the curse of test screenings.The second and third, however were written and filmed together. This was the first big Hollywood project designed in response to questionnaires. You can see it in the recipe. Need more love interest? More actual action? Less Biff? Costumes? Chop, chop, chop.There is a clever thing this movie has that the others did not. It knows it is a movie. It sends our travelers back in time not into an earlier version of their world, but into a movie world. Specifically, it is the most stable genre of all: the western. As soon as Marty arrives, we have the most common trope in westerns: wild Indians yelping as if it were 1955, chased by the cavalry. There are a few jokes about being not in the real world but in a movie world, including the requirements for what happens next.It is not enough. By this time, we are tired of the whole thing.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",Western Genre
"A bit of a riff on the what's up doc quote/line you may know from a completely different place. And a completely different place is where the movie goes. Because after the immediate past and the immediate future (30 years more or less can be considered that in my book), we get to the old West. And we pay tribute to the Westerns in many ways.One of them being Marty calling himself Clint Eastwood. A name that is synonymous with Westerns like almost no other (there's also the Duke of course). Again the chemistry between Doc and Marty is amazing and the backbone of the movie. This being shot back to back after the second one was finished really helped. Getting a trailer at the end of part 2 to get crowds or rather give them a taste was also very well thought of. Marketing wise it may have been a new milestone, a new way and path for others to follow.But money aside (and the trilogy made a lot of it), it seems we do end the movie series here. Even if there are always talks about sequels, I cannot imagine the original crew (or cast for that matter) to return for another run. Especially considering the health issues Michael J Fox has to handle. Having said that, this is a high note and a good way to end it all. A series that brought us or gave us very early performances in small roles by Billy Zane, Elijah Wood and Elisabeth Shue, to name a couple. But a series that especially made us fall in love with Doc Brown and Marty McFly ... knock knock: McFly, anyone home? Yes also a lot of memorable quotes too - Great Scott!",Western Genre
"Back To The Future Part III is an excellent and unforgettable finale to the Back To The Future Trilogy that combines wonderful direction,a terrific cast,a fantastic script,an amazing score and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future Part III a memorable conclusion to the Back To The Future Trilogy and a classic.Taking place after the events in Part II,Back To The Future Part III has Marty(Michael J. Fox)traveling back in time to the Old West to Hill Valley in 1885 to rescue Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)and get him back to 1985. While there in the old west Marty and Doc have to deal with outlaw Buford Maddog Tannen(Thomas F. Wilson)while Doc falls in love with a woman named Clara(Mary Steenburgen).Back To The Future Part III is a brilliant and entertaining finale to the amazing Back To The Future Trilogy and basically proves that all good things must come to an end. Making a final film in a movie Trilogy is tough but Director Robert Zemeckis has created a conclusion that brings things to a fitting end that brings the Back To The Future Trilogy full circle. For 118 minutes Back TO The Future Part III combines different movie genres such as SCI-FI,Comedy,Western,Action and romance giving viewers a genre mash-up of 10 different movies in one but the movie never becoming uneven or confused. Whereas the first film went back in time to the 1950s and the second film went to the past present and future in 2015,Back To The Future goes back in time to the Old West with six shooters,Cowboys and stagecoaches. While the concept of a time traveling movie set in the West won't appeal to most viewers speaking for myself as a Western movie fan I loved it. There are plenty of references to Classic Westerns in Back To The Future Part III mostly to Clint Eastwood Westerns(Marty calls himself Clint Eastwood and wears a poncho resembling Eastwood's in the Spagetti Westerns). Don't expect a realistic or gritty vision of the Wild West because the way the West is depicted in this film is all in great fun. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF PIII are funny,over the top and go with the energy and style of the film which is lighthearted and humorous. The screenplay by Bob Gale is fantastic and memorable with dialog that gives this movie a nice energy and pace that keeps the movie going. While all three BTTF films are character driven Part III is probably the most character driven and introspective especially with our Heroes Marty and Doc Brown. With each of the three films we see Marty becoming more mature but still dealing with issues(Marty doesn't like being called a chicken). But as the film goes on he learns to grow and deal with the problem in an interesting way. With Doc Brown we see a different side to him we didn't see in the first two movies where we see Doc Brown firing a Western style gun,falling in love,showing romantic feelings or dancing with a woman which adds to Doc's character. We also see Marty and Doc friendship at a crossroads because while Marty wants to take Doc back to 1985,Doc is debating whether he wants to stay or go and dealing with their futures. It's the examination of Marty and Doc Brown's characters in this one that make Part III so watchable. The ending of Back To The Future Part III(which is the final 20-30 minutes)is fantastic,thrilling and will leave you with a smile and an unforgettable conclusion to the Back To The Future saga and for Marty and Doc. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent and brilliant as Marty McFly(and Shamus McFly)and Doc Brown once again showing great chemistry. Mary Steenburgen is wonderful and beautiful as Clara,Doc's love interest. Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as Griff Tannen,a Western outlaw and once again as Biff. Lea Thompson is great in a duel role as Maggie Mcfly and Lorianne Baines-McFly. Elisabeth Shue does a good job as Jennifer,Marty's girlfriend. Matt Clark(Chester The Bartender),Pat Buttram(Saloon Old Timer),Harry Carey Jr.(Saloon Old Timer),Dub Taylor(Saloon Old-Timer),James Tolkan(Marshal James Strickland),Marc McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Spencer(Linda McFly)and Flea(Needles)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is outstanding,with Zemeckis bringing the same energy and style to the Western setting. Great direction,Zemeckis.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding,thrilling and fits in well with the Western atmosphere. Fantastic score,Silvestri.The Special Effects by Industrial,Light And Magic are incredible and visual stunning once again. Amazing effects,ILM.In final word,if you love Robert Zemeckis,SCI-FI Films,or the first two Back To The Future films I highly suggest you see Back To The Future Part III,an excellent and unforgettable finale to the trilogy. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Western Genre
"""Back to the Future Part III"" is often considered the weakest entry in the trilogy, with some critics feeling that the film's Western setting is a letdown compared to the more inventive time periods explored in the previous films. The plot is also criticized for feeling predictable and formulaic, with many of the jokes and plot points feeling repetitive or recycled from the earlier films. Some reviewers also felt that the film's pacing is sluggish, with too much time spent on exposition and not enough on character development. While Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are once again excellent in their roles, the supporting cast is generally seen as weaker than in the previous films, with few standout performances. Overall, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is still an enjoyable movie, but it falls short of the high standards set by the earlier films in the series. I personally don't like it.",Western Genre
"When Part 2 ended with one of the best cliffhangers in 80s movies history, no one would've expected part iii. But come summer 1990, this is what we got. Underrated sequel taking place in the old west and ending on a high note, this film (the first to use the 75th anniversary logo for Universal's studios in California) is a great ending to a great and original trilogy. ZZ Top makes their cinematic debut in this film and Mary Steenburgen makes her franchise debut along with a few new faces as well as Alan Silvestri's iconic score. There have been rumors of a part iv, but it's not true. Like the previous two movies, it's rated PG.",Western Genre
"Back to the Future Part III' is the weakest installment of the series, though still produces a good, solid film to wrap the trilogy up.The western theme was nice, while the two stars again produced excellent displays. However, the plot began to wear thin a little bit - part III was an ideal time to end things.",Western Genre
"Without a doubt, 1985's ""Back to the Future"" turned out to be a massive hit. After that movie, it took four years for the first sequel to finally come, but then the final installment in the trilogy was released the following year. Neither of these sequels have generally been considered as good as the original smash hit sci-fi comedy, and it seems that quite a few ""Back to the Future"" fans have been disappointed by them, but in my opinion, they are both only slightly inferior.Marty is stuck in the year 1955 again, while the Doc Brown of 1985 is stuck in 1885. Marty has received a letter from Doc from 1885, telling him where he is, and giving him instructions on where to find the damaged time machine so the Doc of 1955 can help the 1980s teenager get back to his time. Doc has also told Marty in this letter that he is happy in 1885 and Marty is not to attempt to rescue him. However, just after Marty and the Doc of 1955 find the time machine, Marty sees a tombstone with Doc's name on it! It turns out that the scientist was shot in 1885 by an outlaw named Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (an ancestor of Biff Tannen), not long after he wrote the letter to Marty! So now, despite Doc's instructions, Marty must use the repaired time machine to travel back to the old west and save his friend! If you look at the IMDb ratings and votes for the three installments in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, it is clear that each one is less popular than the last. Each film has a lower rating than the last, and has less votes. In fact, the original 1985 blockbuster has a significantly higher rating than its two sequels, as well as a significantly higher number of votes. However, parts two and three still have reasonably high ratings, and both have over 40, 000 votes, which means they are fairly popular. While I agree that neither sequel can match the original, both of them have enough qualities to make them worthy sequels.Of the three movies, ""Back to the Future Part III"" definitely bears the most differences from the others. Since so much of it takes place in the old west, this final installment in the trilogy is partially a western, which is not something that can be said about its two predecessors. So, for fans of the previous two installments (or at least the original) who strongly dislike the western genre in movies, this conclusion in the trilogy would obviously be disappointing. However, unless you detest westerns in general, ""Part III"" could be very enjoyable for you, with lots of excitement, as well as some laughs (just like parts one and two). While ""Part III"" may not be as consistent as the original, it's still a job well done, and if you want to see how the story ends, I highly doubt you want to miss it.",Western Genre
"""Part III"" is just as good as ""Part II"", both worthy follow ups but can't quite touch the original. It's got less sophisticated special effects and plot lines than the second film. I'd say the ending sours a lot of it for me too. Not the entire ending, just the very ending. I'm glad that it wasn't spoiled by a fourth part, this movie ends the trilogy at the right time, any more and they would have completely jumped the shark. The Wild West setting is awesome and I love a lot of the deja vu sequences in the second and third film that mirror a lot of things from the first.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are both great once again, as is the rest of the supporting cast. Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) is a welcome addition to the cast. And we get to see Thomas F. Wilson return once again as Biff's great-grandfather Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, which is awesome to see.There is a slight decline in my personal preferences throughout the series, but some hold ""Part III"" as better than ""Part II."" I like the western theme, but the future and the alternate 1985 really seal the second film as my second favorite. Of course, you should obviously watch the preceding films before this one, but once you get past the first two this one should be soon to follow. I recommend a day-long movie marathon; it's fun to watch these movies back-to-back and watch the time traveling adventure unfold all before your eyes.",Western Genre
"The stage curtains open ...Only six months after ""Part II"" came out, we got the final entry into the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy. It helped to kickstart a fun movie summer in 1990. Many have touted ""Part III"" as the weakest of the three movies. I beg to differ, I felt that it was the 2nd best one with ""Part II"" being the weakest of the bunch. It was very strong and a great finish to what started back in 1985. I was newly married by this time, and life was good - so, maybe I'm a little bit biased, but I loved this movie.This one picks right up where the last one left off, with Doc mysteriously disappearing having been struck by lightning while inside the DeLorean. Marty receives documents that had been sealed and saved for him for the past 70 years - and to his amazement, he finds that Doc is alive and well in the old west, in the year 1885. However, when he finds out Doc's demise, he knows he must once more travel through time to save his best friend leading to a climactic finish to our story.This was such a good movie with delightful performances. It was not only a great nod to western films, but to Clint Eastwood himself. The character of Clara Clayton (played by Mary Steenburgen) was a welcome addition. We also get a nice cameo from the band ZZ Top. This film ties up all the loose ends effectively, and it was a fond farewell to characters we've grown to love over the years. As the final credits began to roll, I felt a tug at my heartstrings. I was going to miss my friends.I highly recommend, not only this movie, but the entire trilogy. It should be watched back-to-back-to-back (1, 2, 3) ... and enjoyed again and again. When they came out on VHS tape (yes, I am that old), I purchased them and have watched them over and over through the years and loved it just as much with each viewing. Now, they grace my collection on Blu-ray. This gets a very strong 9 stars out of 10.",Western Genre
"Back To The Future part III was an improvement on part II, but still had a feeling of deja vu, and when they would try to do something different with the characters, familiarity with the setups fills the air, and the pieces would fall into place and we were watching a Western remake of the original. The DeLorean was clearly on its last leg, the wheels had quite literally fallen off, the fuel pump gone, no fuel, it's up to Marty and quack Doc Brown to get it up to 88 MPH, to get their happy asses back to the future, again. But then love rears its head in the form of Mary Steenbergen, and the Doc's plans might be changing. The leads are all as good as they ever were, but the formula was wearing thin. Still, this has more heart and charm in it than its predecessor, and the lighting in the Doc's stable was beautiful (as odd of a compliment as that may be) Another round of applause from the audience when this one ended was a great way to end the evening, Back To The Future day, 21 October 2015, as a good time was had by all.",Western Genre
"It's back to the past in this last sequel of a great epic time- traveling trilogy. In Part III Fox and Lloyd are joined by Steenburgen. The Doc finally solves the other great mystery of the universe; women. It's great to see his character grow and have a romance in an unexpected time period. I believe this plot element was beautifully handled.Once more the duo have a problem returning to the future, which is their present time, which is now the past. Gasoline of all things is now the culprit. But that doesn't stop the genius Doctor Brown from coming up with a plan to get home.I saw this in my teens at my local cinema as a double feature. This movie has it all: cowboys, gun showdown, romance, science fiction, and a train robbery...or was it just a science experiment?The future is what you make of it.",Western Genre
"Back To The Future III' finally shows that this most successful and popular movie series has come to a disappointing end. Made back to back with BTTF 2, BTTF 3 loses the magic that the first two movies captured, to its detriment. Marty McFly, the hero of the first two movies is now in a bit of bother as he is left stranded in back in 1955. When he receives an urgent letter from his good friend Doc Brown, Marty is told to leave him alone where he is. Marty is dumbfounded as to what he should do. However, more devastating news is about to be discovered by our junior time traveler.
Fulfilling a long-time fantasy, Doc Brown has decided to live in the old West of the 1880s. But when he is in danger of meeting an untimely end, Marty travels back in time to rescue him. There is just one problem: Doc Brown is smitten by a school teacher Clara Clayton that he can't think straight! Now, it is up to Marty to keep Doc out of trouble, the DeLorean running, and the past, present and future on track so they can all get back to where - and when - they belong!Again the story of BBTF 3 is a highlight to this film. Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale cleverly interweaved love and time in such a sweet and romantic way in all BTTF films. In the first it was Marty's parents, in the second it was Marty's own romance that needed help and the third focuses on Doc Brown and his love at first sight with the beautiful school teacher Clara Clayton. This movie is also placed in the old west of the 1880's, showing Hill Valley in the olden days. While I feel I have seen better western settings, the way the actors went about creating the 1880's feel, seemed accurate enough.
The cast was back once again, to finish off the BTTF story. Michael J. Fox is one great actor. He once more shows why he was the perfect choice as Marty McFly. Marty has been through so much as a character that in no way would his character have been boring to portray. Again Fox had to learn how to do many of the talents that his character has to show off in the old west. Such things as Gun shooting and horse riding are just two of the new editions to the long bow that Fox had to learn. I feel for a guy like Fox who has succumbed to the horrible side effects of Parkinson disease. He has stopped doing full-time acting, which is a great shame.Doc Brown was once again performed grandly by Christopher Lloyd. He is so involved as the Doc, always warning of the dangerous effects that could go wrong if they interfere with the past or the future. Putting on his old west shoes in this movie, Lloyd does a good job in showing that he is not just able to be a wacky 1950s or 80's scientist. The way Doc gets Marty back to the future here is clever and one of the movies high points. The Doc's love interest is the local school teacher Clara (Mary Steenburgen) who was again well suited to her role. I have recently seen Steenburgen in the new release movie titled 'Life as a house', a movie that I really enjoyed.
Other cast members include regulars such as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who was another actor who made the transition from the first two movies into the old west beautifully. The rivalry that Tannen and the McFlys have on this film is one of the highlights of the entire series. I love it when 'Mad Dog' says to 'Clint Eastwood', `Nobody calls me 'Mad Dog', especially not some, duded up egg sucking gutter trash!'  Lea Thompson is back as Marty's aging Mother and long lost relative of the west, 'Maggie McFly'. With all of these actors taking on various roles making them incredibly interesting to watch, as you want to know how different they will be next. There is one another character I want to point out to you that I find interesting. Although he only has a minor role, Chester, the palace saloon bartender (Matt Clark) and I, have somethings in common. We share the same name oddly enough, in addition to the fact that I one day want to be a bar tender as well. Is that ironic? I feel it is!Overall the 'Back To The Future' series was and is still a delight to watch, 'time and time again'. The only problem I have with the second and third movie being made back to back, is that they each take a bit away from each other. I would have preferred a small gap between each one, so they could have both been given the attention they deserve. Robert Zemeckis is a great director and I am sure gives most of the credit for his success as a director to the BTTF trilogy. I am another fan of Zemeckis' work. I would love to have gone through the experiences that Marty McFly did with time-travel into the past and the future.  Yet I will always remember what Doc Brown says at the end of this movie `You're future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.' That is good advice that I feel everyone needs to listen and do!CMRS give 'Back To The Future III': 3 (Good Film)",Western Genre
"The Back to the Future trilogy is now complete and we have now seen time travel from the current 1985 back to 1955 then fast forward to 2015 and then slingshot back to the old cowpoke days of 1885 in Hill Valley. Don't despair though because that dastardly badman Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen / Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) is back in the saddle to wreak havoc on not only the town of Hill Valley but to challenge quick draw Marty McFly to a draw.Marty travels back to 1885 to try and save his good friend Doc, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) after his name appears on a tombstone after drawing against Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. Good old Doc the scientist also finds a fellow book lover of H.G. Wells time travel in the pretty Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) and rather than have the romance aspect revolve around Marty McFly this time their are hearts a fluttering with Dr. Emmett Brown so the third time around is in fact a charm.It was a great way to end the trilogy and a western to boot!I give this third chapter a steady 9 out of 10 rating.",Western Genre
"Robert Zemeckis's fantastic time travel trilogy ends with a whimper. Well, all right, that may be a little harsh, but I don't feel it lived up to the fun of the first two. The finale finds Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) trapped in the wild west of 1885 and Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is determined to bring him back when he discovers Doc is murdered by local outlaw Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). It's got some fun moments but my favorite aspect of the trilogy, time travel, isn't as prominent this time around.After Marty arrives in 1885, the time travel element is put on hold for the duration of the film, as the DeLorean is temporarily out of commission. This is unfortunate, as the DeLorean is probably my favorite ""character"" from the trilogy. Watching as Doc and Marty bounce around time to fix the paradoxes they create was always a blast; this time it's just a matter of getting back to the future before Tannen kills either one of them. We're also treated to a new love interest for Doc, in the form of Mary Steenburgen as schoolteacher Clara Clayton. It's nice to see Doc getting attention but it's still not what I was looking for in a BTTF film.The movie plays out like a generic western/fish-out-of-water comedy and is good for some laughs. Marty's reaction to antiquated life in the old west is funny enough and I loved the final act with Doc and Marty's final confrontation with Tannen and race against time to get the DeLorean up to speed. Still, of the three films, this film finds itself as the weak link in the chain. The cast is phenomenal as we've come to expect, and it really helps with the mediocre storyline. On the off chance you haven't already since this, don't expect the final installment of one of cinema's most memorable series to leave you completely satisfied, but at least you know you can count on an entertaining two hours.",Western Genre
What was the time-travel charmer thinking? A trip to the old-west and 1885 please give me and all other movie fans a break. What a terrible way to end a great trilogy. Instead of ending Back to the Future with an 1885 era why not keep the drama unfolding in the modern 1985 era or the baby boom 1955 era it would have had more interest with an audience in 1990. Sure this film like the previous two from the trilogy has excitement and good performances I must once again admire the work of Michael J. Fox. Yet things just don't seem the same I personally felt the final focused to much on the life of Doc (Christopher Lloyd) as in the end he is happy that he finally found his mate for life and returns to the old-west of 1885 more happiness should have been directed at Marty as the film could have ended showing him happy with family and wife Jennifer in the future. Believe I happen to be right about part III it clearly does not get the same numerous showings that the first two Back to the Future movies do as I continue to see Back to the Future get numerous airings on TBS and Back to the Future II get numerous airings on the USA cable network or Sci-Fi network when part III is rarely shown it just goes to show which movies in the trilogy had the best quality and most popularity. Watch the first two Back to the Future movies anytime you will get the best entertainment of your life avoid the third and final it simply just lost it's luster and ran out of gas. Then again you might enjoy if you like the western genre of film but I doubt it.,Western Genre
"...but just a taste mind you, then its back in the wrapper and on with the now unbelievably complex story in this final bit of time jumping good time, 'rum pum pum, bang the magic drum' entertainment. Better plotted than part II because it has a simpler, more character focused story, it's really Doc Brown's film in which Marty plays an lesser role and thats fine with me because he was always my favourite of the two anyway. I'm not a fans of Westerns, though they've grown on me in the last few years, but the third portion is a affectionate pastiche which plenty to enjoy and although a love interest sub-plot is about as welcome as freight train careering into your life's work, Mary Steenburgen, drippy and a little bit kooky, just about cuts the mustard though given her tendency to cause problems for the time travelling duo perhaps letting her fall to her death might have been the safest course of action. Its all tied up in a fairly moralistic, 'everyone gazes lovingly into each others eyes' fashion which makes us cynical Europeans groan a bit and I'm fairly sure steam power isn't quite a viable substitute for plutonium but in a series with flying cars and a Libyan terrorist cell chasing a teenager with a rocket launcher in the middle of a Californian shopping mall car park, thats just niggling. A terrible waste of a Delorean too, you can't just walk into a showroom and buy another one y'know!",Western Genre
"To fully enjoy Back to the Future Part III, you will have had to seen and remember the first two Back to the Futures. They reference and allude to them so many times; you have to remember everything fully. Of course, the first one is the real one, so they go back to that one more often.Michael J. Fox is back for his third outing as Marty McFly, time traveler. Christopher Lloyd is Dr. Emmett Brown, mad scientist. In the first one, Doc made a time machine and Marty went to 1955 and made his parents not meet. In Part II, Marty went to 2015. Now, because Doc from 1955 went back to 1885 and he's going to get himself killed, Marty goes there. Believe me, the plot is a whole lot crazier than that. Speaking of crazy, Doc looks a lot crazier than in parts I and II.Not as good as the first, way better than the second. Fox and Lloyd are quite good, with comedic timing, real chemistry, and making sure the movie doesn't have one dull point. Also, Lloyd has superior chemistry with a teacher in the Old West, Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), who comes in. Of course, because Doc wasn't supposed to be out there in the first place, it causes a paradox in the time-space continuum, meaning that what would happen in the future won't happen. You can discuss the technicalities and the plot holes/paradoxes, but really, you're not supposed to.Not really being a fan of the Old West, I wasn't really looking forward to this. However, I do like futuristic movies, I didn't really like the second one. Basically, it's a flip-flop. Many times, it looked like a stereotypical Western, with its gunslingers and its facades.Going back to the technical aspects (besides Doc saying `Great Scott!' many times), if you think closely, the three movies take place in one day. The fun of these types of movies should be put into a TV series. Most movies-to-TV-series don't work, but if they keep going to different time periods, it would be fun.There's not really much more to say, except that it's funny and extremely entertaining, a must for any casual sci-fi, adventure, western, or comedy fan.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for profanity, action violence, and sticky situations.",Western Genre
"I'm sorry to say this is the third best of the trilogy, which means it is at the bottom.  So I recommend to see either one of the first two if you want. But, that doesn't mean this film is a waste of time compared to other films.  For instance, this is a way to keep from watching CNN.  But seriously, this isn't all that bad, because for fans of westerns who want a chuckle, this is for you.  Or if you want to see Christopher Lloyd drunk. Sometimes funny, sometimes cute, usually overdone.  B+",Western Genre
"Not sure why this film is a 7.4?Also 'Karate Kid' (original) is 7.3? Maybe take the votes away from the illegal teenage stealers who rip these films off and then vote '1's - mean-spirited little peopleThe film works very well on a technical level, with some good Western-style variations on Alan Silvestri's memorable theme score. There is a strong continuity, in plot and references, to the previous films. The over-the-top, cartoonish style of the second film has been replaced with a more relaxed, romantic tone that eases the series towards it's conclusion. Special effects are as spectacular as ever, particularly in the train chase finale.The old-style Western setting allows for a lot of funny nods and references to Western films, particularly 'High Noon', 'My Darling Clementine' and, most memorably, 'A Fistful of Dollars'. Marty passes himself off as 'Clint Eastwood' and when he refuses to face Tannen in a duel he's told: 'Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood is the biggest yellabelly in the West.'The acting, on all fronts, is much better. Fox completes his character's arc begun in the second film, as he finally learns the value of self-control and restraint. It's interesting how in the first film he resolves his parents destiny, in the second his children's, and the third film he finally sorts out his own. He also appears, with Lea Thompson, as his own ancestor. He has a cheesy Irish accent, but he still pulls the part off.",Western Genre
"The ending of Back To The Future Part II left most audiences a bit disappointed. That is however the true fans embraced the fact that Back To The Future would soon become a film trilogy.Picking up where we left off from the original sequel, Marty is stuck in 1955 with no Delorean. Doc Brown has been sent off to 1885 from a freak accident.Marty Mcfly is determined to see Doc Brown home to 1985. That is however when a charming Clara Clayton, (Mary Steenbergen) comes to town, Doc suddenly finds himself head over heals for her. While this is going on, Marty's short temper lands him a staged fight with the notorious Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. Not only that, but the Delorean time machine is still not functioning correctly.The original theatrical release landed on Friday, May 24th, 1990 - Memorial Day weekend. Limited places around the United States were showing all three films back to back to back.What makes the third film exciting in it's own way is that this was a first chance to go into the wild west from the perspective of a time traveler, not somebody who was already there. This had never been done before, let alone having a time travel series reach a second sequel. The only other storyline that is remotely like this is A Yankie Doodle in King Arthur's Court, which is a plot that has been a bit over-exhausted.True fans of Back to The Future will no be disappointed. All of the main actors from the first two films returned, (minus Crispen Glover who had a few problems with the way his character was portrayed). Tom Wilson who plays Biff Tannen in the series made history by taking on multiple roles of the Tannen family members, Griff Tannen, Old Biff, Biff in 1985 and Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.Rumors of a fourth film have gone across the web and back. It is in the contract with Universal and Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have stated that it ends with the third film. The only other versions were the Saturday morning cartoon that ran from 1991 to 1993 and the Ride at Universal from 1991 to 2007.",Western Genre
"Back to the Future is a great movie and it is part of a great trilogy.Many people may not like the time travel movies but I do and BTTF trilogy is the movies for ME.I just love the fact that one of MY favorite actors Christopher Lloyd is in all three of them and I just love the way he is in them.And not to mention Michael J. Fox,Thomas F. Wilson and most of the others are in the three films.Part III continues where part II left off perfectly! This takes place in the old west and I`M not gonna spoil the rest.This is a good film and it is the most different of the three. The Back to the Future trilogy is one of the best trilogies there is in MY opinion and I hope everyone gets to see this great film series!",Western Genre
"I'll admit that probably the reason why I find this movie to be the lesser one of the three Back to the Future movies, has all to do with the reason that Western has never really been my favorite movie genre. This movie is almost set entirely in the Wild West of the late 19th century.The movie features all of the Western clich��s but at the same time it doesn't ridicule the genre. Pistol fights at dawn, hanging, robbing the stagecoach, typical villains, a sheriff, you name it and its in this movie. You may say that Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale pay a great homage to the longtime gone genre of classic spaghetti Westerns, with using all of the typical clich��s and small references.""Back to the Future"" and ""Back to the Future Part II"" were two brilliantly written movies, with ingenious connected plot lines, moments and characters. ""Back to the Future Part III"" is also well written and is definitely fun and entertaining but just not as clever or ingenious as the previous two movies. ""Back to the Future Part III"" surely does still offer plenty of enough entertainment and cleverness. It makes sure that the movie overall is an entertaining one, that is also definitely helped by its characters and good, quick, fun directing from Robert Zemeckis, who with the Back to the Future movies made himself immortal as a movie director.Besides the Wild West concept the movie also differs from the other previous two Back to the Future movies in many more ways. Of course the Wild West already provides the movie with a totally different atmosphere and premise than the previous two Back to the Future movies but also the storytelling and approach makes this movie a 'different' one. You can really say that perhaps this time the real main character of the movie is the Doc. The main plot line (a love story) of the movie involves him. Not much room for Marty and his family this time in this one, unlike had been the case in the previous two movies. I liked the previous two movies so much because Marty clashed in his past and future with his own relatives, that were alive at that time period. It always resulted in some comical- and brilliant written and constructed moments. ""Back to the Future Part III"" doesn't really have enough moments of that. It still has some fun moments involving time traveling and of course mainly the cultural differences that show what happens if characters from this time period are being set back in the early 19th century. It makes some of the moments in the movie still hilarious, such as Marty's clothes, his choice to name himself Clint Eastwood, Frisbees and the opening ceremony of the well known clock from the Back to the Future movies.The movie of course also future 'distant' relatives of characters that are alive in 1985, the real-time, time period of the entire trilogy. Some play a more prominent role than others. Again the main villain is a Tannen. Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, to be exact. A typical stereotype example of a dumb but ruthless Western villain. He is perfectly portrayed by Thomas F. Wilson. The entire cast is basically great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have really grown into their roles and the chemistry is still there. They are being helped this time by the great Mary Steenburgen, as Doc's love interest.What I love about the Back to the Future movies is that they always pick things up were the last movie ended. It makes the movie really a trilogy that can also be perfectly watched as one movie, just as the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars movies.The movie is really great looking with great sets, costumes and make-up effects that suit the time period of the movie just right. What the movie also does well is blending in the different atmospheres of the different time periods with each others. When the movie is set back in 1985, you don't have the feeling like you're watching a totally different movie. Dean Cundey's cinematography of the movie is great and he also plays a small cameo role in the movie itself by the way. Alan Silvestri's musical score is also great but again also the lesser of the three in my opinion. But it's still great, so what am I really complaining about...The early special effects are also quite good, considering its period this movie was made.The movie is really great, fun, clean, adventurous entertainment to watch from start till finish, with fun characters, settings and directing. A fitting conclusion of perhaps the most entertaining movie trilogy of all time.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Western Genre
"This film is a rather lacklustre conclusion to the Back to the Future trilogy. I'm not really interested in the Western genre although it does add to the challenge faced by the protagonists. It's not bad, it just doesn't live up to the rest of the series.",Western Genre
"Not only do whole sequences from the original movie reoccur, but situations as well as when the manure falls on Buford Tannen. No doubt this is intentional. But there is very little new in this third of the series except for the western setting and the romance of Emmett and Clara.I thought the first film was fine in it's way and both sequels were not needed, especially this one.",Western Genre
"Why? The question we all asked when the last scene was over, and before the end credits, when it said ""the end."" It is true that the stories of Doc Brown and Marty McFly didn't necessarily end (as they continued in animated form and a Universal Studio ride), but I think we all hoped for Back to the Future 4.The western themed Back to the Future 3 was pretty great. Not only does Marty use Clint Eastwoods name as his persona (Which tickled Clint). But celebrated western character actors had small roles as well, like Dub Taylor, Pat Buttram and Harry Carey Jr.The end of the greatest franchise in cinema history, in my opinion.",Western Genre
"The first Back to the Future film was absolute genius. What a brilliant story, Marty McFly stuck in the past having to ensure his parents get together lest he be erased from existence. In Part II things got a little complicated and convoluted. Back and forth we went, from 1985 to 2015 to the hellish alternate 1985. And ultimately back to 1955, in fact right back into the first movie, Johnny B. Goode and all. Maybe it was at times a little hard to follow, maybe it wasn't quite as much fun as the original. But Part II was still an excellent film with a very smart, albeit complex, story. And that set us up for Part III which would prove to be a worthy conclusion to one of the greatest adventures of all time.When last we left our heroes Marty McFly was stuck in 1955 (again) and a bolt of lightning had just sent Doc Brown careening back to 1885. Doc is quite content to live out his days in the Old West. Through the magic of Western Union he has told Marty to go to 1955 Doc (keep your Docs straight) for help in returning to 1985. But Marty and 1955 Doc make a terrible discovery. Just six days after writing that letter to Marty the Doc stuck in 1885 will be shot and killed. ""Shot in the back by Buford Tannen, over a matter of eighty dollars"" reads Doc's tombstone. As 1955 Doc puts it, ""What kind of a future do you call that?"" There's only one thing for Marty to do, fire up the DeLorean and head back to 1885 to bring Doc home.From there it's a rather simple story, much simpler than either of the first two films. No more bouncing around the space-time continuum, no paradoxes to unravel the universe. It's basically just a Western. But as Westerns go it's quite a fun one. Seeing the Hill Valley of 1885, and its cast of characters, is quite a treat. There's another generation of McFlys for us to get to know. There's another Strickland, always the disciplinarians in that family. And of course, as in any good Western, there's a vile, odious villain. And in a Back to the Future film that villain just has to be a Tannen. Buford Tannen, call him Mad Dog at your own peril, makes his descendant Biff look like an innocent choirboy. Mad Dog more than lives up to that nickname he so despises. And there is one more important new character. Clara Clayton, a schoolteacher who greatly complicates Marty and Doc's return to 1985. Because Doc Brown, always the pragmatic man of science, has fallen head over heels in love with this woman who died decades before he was born. Seems maybe we'll have a paradox after all.So Doc decides rather than go back to 1985 he wants to stay in the past with Clara. Of course there's the small matter that he's days away from being killed. It all makes for great entertainment. No, it's not as brilliant a story as in either of the first two films. But this simpler story has so much charm. It's great to see Doc in love and Clara makes a perfect match for him. They're like two lost little puppy dogs, the connection between the two instantaneous and incredibly endearing. What kind of a woman could fall in love with Doc Brown? Mary Steenburgen does a great job in portraying Clara, the kind of woman who could do just that. With Steenburgen having the key female role Lea Thompson has only a bit part this time around. But it's great to see her, you can't imagine a Back to the Future film without her. Thomas F. Wilson is simply terrific as Mad Dog Tannen, a nasty villain whom Wilson infuses with wonderful personality. But of course, as ever, the headliners are Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as Marty and Doc. One of the all-time great film pairings. Two great actors who were absolutely perfect for their respective roles. What a journey those two characters went on over the course of these three films. This third installment may not be as frantic as the first two. It's not bursting with excitement, it's a little slower, suiting its Old West time. After the grave consequences of Marty and Doc's actions in the other films the story here can seem a bit mundane by comparison. But it still entertains, it really is great fun. Maybe the fact the consequences weren't so grave allowed the film to let loose and just enjoy itself a bit. We get one last look at these characters we've come to know and love. And this film gives them the rousing sendoff they deserve.",Western Genre
"Back To The Future Part Three is a fantastic movie with an amazing story line,terrific characters and a great cast.Fans of the previous two installments wont be too disappointed,I do think that the previous two are better,but this is still terrific,especially for a third installment,but I just found the the previous two,jumping around from past,present and future,more interesting and exciting than the Wild West heme in this,but its still very enjoyable with a good Western parody and wraps up the trilogy perfectly,you wont be wishing they made a fourth one,because they started and finished this trilogy too well to take any chances with a new version.Back to the Future is definitely the weakest of the trilogy,but its still both an exciting and pleasing conclusion.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travels back in time to 1885,where his friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher Llyod) is enjoying a more peaceful wild west atmosphere there,but Marty must save him,because judging by his gravestone that Marty discovered in 1955,he will be shot and killed in one week.",Western Genre
"The third part of the series passes in year 1885. The Wild West is very nicely constructed. There are some cowboys, outlaws and a sheriff. The accent and behavior of people are hilarious. Marty McFly goes back from 1955 to 1885 to save Dr. Brown who was supposed to be killed in a week. Once again, screenplay and acting are great. After having finished all three parts of the movie, I can say that this trilogy is a must-see for all ages due to its unique fictional elements.",Western Genre
"""Back to the Future Part III"" is a great last part of a classic trilogy. ""Part III"" is funny and very exciting. It's the love story, however, that makes this movie so good. Doc Brown and Clara are one of my top five movie love stories. Biff (I mean Mad Dog) is great as always. As a western movie fan I enjoy how ""Part III"" plays by all of the western rules. It's not a spoof. It's a western with a time machine thrown in. Great fun all around.",Western Genre
"The final installment in the Back to the Future franchise once again picks up from where the previous film left us, with Marty (Michael J. Fox) trapped in the past and with a letter in his hand from Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), now living in the 19th century as a village blacksmith. And thus, it's once again the job of our heroes to get, you guessed it, back to the future.The first Back to the Future is undoubtedly the best in the franchise, there's no arguing about that. It is the most original, gets to do the best jokes, flows the smoothest and has the tightest narrative. But, many would claim that the second film is also the second best. A fair point, as it has some of the most memorable scenes and is arguably the most creative of the three. But, personally I do think that it jumped around a bit too much and that the third one is the better movie because it tells its story better, contains all the good sides shared by the two previous films and is a magnificent end to one of the best movie trilogies ever made.Plus I'm a sucker for good western comedy, which this movie has tons in it. That might have something to do with it.Once again all the actors reprise their roles and do it magnificently. Thomas F. Wilson shows a whole new side from himself as Mad Dog Tannen, a Wild West outlaw with a grudge to settle with Doc. The new characters, most notably Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton, also do a good job of being both sympathetic characters as well as hilarious parodies of the western stereotypes. Just like in the previous films.Definitely do check the film out if you haven't seen it already and liked the previous two films. It continues the story flawlessly and is an exciting end to our tale of Marty and Doc.",Western Genre
"Sometime after the release of the second part, the viewer can say goodbye to one of the best trilogies in the history of cinema. Circular, well-finished, with great performances. Seen as a whole, it is easily one of the best trilogies ever made, although Part II suffers from the dizzying speed of its script. Directed again by Robert Zemeckis, the film featured Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson in its cast of actors. The film continues the story left open in Part II (1989): while arrested in 1955 during his time travel adventures, Marty McFly (Fox) discovers that his friend Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Lloyd), who finds himself arrested in 1885, was killed by Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Wilson), Biff's great-grandfather; Marty travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return permanently to 1985, but things get complicated when Doc falls in love with Professor Clara Clayton (Steenburgen).Filmed simultaneously with the second part, this final part had its scenes shot in the American states of California and Arizona. The origins of the western theme of Back to the Future Part III go back to the production of the first film in the trilogy. During the filming of the first part, director Robert Zemeckis asked Michael J. Fox what time frame he would like to see; Fox replied that he wanted to visit the Wild West and meet cowboys. Zemeckis and writer-producer Bob Gale were thrilled with the idea, but held it until the production of part III.Despite being a spectacular film, the second part presents some inconsistencies in the script and is considered by many to be a bit confusing, with several comings and goings in time (past, present and future), in addition to having a frantic pace. These aspects do not get in the way of the experience, which proved to be extremely efficient, doing an incredible job of recreating scenes from the original film, pleasing the audience. Here in this third part, the rhythm of the story maintains a precise cadence, with a narrative much less frantic and without clippings with time jumps. It is a substantially linear story that, like the second film, makes use of viewers' familiarity with the mythology of the franchise, in addition to playing with Western gender stereotypes, from the first scene in the old west, with the conflict between white men and Indians. We have, for example, the saloon, with prostitutes on the first floor and the traditional whiskey served to the bad-looking men on the ground floor, men riding horses, carts, the railroad, a train robbery and, of course, the duel between the good guy and the bad guy. Zemeckis also takes the opportunity to make several references to classic films such as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Fulminante Impacto"" (when Marty plays with the gun in front of the mirror) and, mainly, to the star Clint Eastwood and the western spaghetti (note how the traveling that reveals the city of Hill Valey refers to the same camera movement of Sergio Leone that reveals the city of ""Once Upon a Time in the West""), in addition to also making references to pop culture, such as Marty's dance in the hall clearly inspired by Michael Jackson .The characters remain great, the friendship between the protagonists is closer than ever, but the truth is that the essence of the trilogy is missing a little more: time travel. After watching the first films, the feeling we have is that the comings and goings of yore are missing. While Back to the Future II was a roller coaster, full of events and twists, the third part of the trilogy is not so exciting. Except for the scene of the locomotive theft and the whole preamble of the return to the future on the train tracks, the feature film lacks memorable moments. The absence of DeLorean and the possibility of new time travels end up taking from Back to the Future III the best quality of the saga: the potential to be anywhere in time. As he invested in the western, Zemeckis did not think that he could alienate fans of science fiction or adventure and, by not building a pure western, also failing to deliver what admirers of that genre would like to see. The film is halfway there.The script by Bob Gale and the direction of Zemeckis play and open space for many games with the western in general. There is the reproduction of the famous final sequence of Por Um Puhado de Dollars, the first film in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, a film that is watched by the 1985 Biff of Back to the Future Part II in a beautiful foreshadowing. There is also the great satire done to classic westerns in which the heroes dressed in complete disagreement with reality, through the ridiculous pink cowboy outfit that Mary wears. There are natives hunted by the cavalry. It is a delight to look for references of the genre.
Once again we are introduced to Hill Valley and again we stroll through the most characteristic points of the city in formation. The great point of convergence is the famous clock that, for the first time, we see outside the fateful tower that would be struck by lightning in 1955. But we are also introduced to Marty's ancestors, the good-hearted Irish immigrants Seamus McFly (the Fox himself) and Maggie McFly (Lea Thompson reprising his role) who welcome Marty - or Clint Eastwood, as they prefer - on his farm. The characteristics of Irish immigration and the ""conquest of the West"" are all there, with the couple struggling to maintain the farm, not being accepted by the locals and functioning as we expect from characters like that in classic Westerns. Mad Dog Tannen is also the stereotype of the movie villain of the genre, with his huge mustache, dark clothes and tough guy's pose. Thomas F. Wilson plays an extremely amusing villain. It is amazing how Gale and Zemeckis work naturally with each character, presenting them to the viewer without any continuity solution.The novelty is due to the introduction of Professor Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) in the narrative structure as romantic interest of Doc Brown, who considers love illogical. The interaction between the two is excellent, with a Doc without words and taken by the girl who saves from death, potentially changing the future. Steenburgen's role in the story is organic and truly important, starting a chain of events that flows into the tape's epilogue. The plot of romance between the two works well because we care about the scientist, because we want him to relate to someone on a higher level than the intellectual.In addition to constantly referring to the characters' striking characteristics, such as Marty's untimely reaction to being called a coward, the script also reveals several actions that would reflect on the future of families in the city, such as when Doc and Clara talk about the geography of the moon, which would inspire the name of the doctor's dog many years later. The script is still full of comic relief, as when Doc says ""I'm glad I didn't end up in the Middle Ages"", because there he would be burned at the stake or in the funny joke about what is produced in Japan. We can still quote the joke about the origin of the ""frisbee"", the origin of the ""Clayton"" ravine that turns into the ""Eastwood"" ravine and the ending of Tannen that refers to the previous films.Zemeckis also shows talent in creating subtle and symbolic moments, as in the plan where McFly plays with his great-grandfather, still a baby, while Seamus McFly talks with his wife. The McFly family's future depended on the child's survival and Marty knew this, as is evident when he tells Seamus ""take good care of the baby"". When Marty informs Doc that Deloren was out of fuel, the close-up on the scientist's face exposes the seriousness of the situation and, at the same time, reveals the image of Marty in the mirror, now quite concerned. And finally, Zemeckis perfectly drives the exciting back-to-future sequence on the railroad, alternating between plans showing Marty in distress inside Deloren, Doc trying to get to the car and Clara trying to reach Doc, in a great scene that also has special effects from Industrial Light & Magic, which, for example, allow Doc's final flight to look credible.The feature also features a great ambience work that throws us into the atmosphere of the old west, starting with the director of photography by Dean Cundey, who uses the sepia tone characteristic of the western and, together with the general plans of Zemeckis, explores competently the beautiful landscapes of the region. The excellent art direction of Margie Stone McShirley and William James Teegarden and the costumes by Joanna Johnston also help to acclimate the viewer, through the wooden structure of the city's buildings, the traditional saloon, men's hats and boots, impeccable dresses women and the train that runs along the railroad.With Alan Silvestri's unforgettable score and the ZZ Top bearded special participation (appearing at the party in the old west and with a song on the soundtrack), Back to the Future III may not be the best chapter in the trilogy, but it entertains the enough with its range of memorable characters. The end result balances action with romance and visual accuracy as efficiently as the original classic. A cinematic pleasure like few others. When we see the vehicle that transported our dreams being completely destroyed, the feeling of sadness is inevitable. The end of Deloren also symbolizes the end of the trilogy and, at this moment, nostalgia takes over the viewer. Not even the happy ending, with the happy return of Doc and Clara aboard one of the most incredible time machines in cinema, avoids this sensation. On the other hand, we feel fulfilled by being able to follow three films with such quality, that they never fall into the repeated repetition of formulas, seeking to reinvent themselves in different ways. With a lot of creativity and inspiration, Zemeckis and his cast gave us a real gift that, unlike Deloren, can never be destroyed.",Western Genre
"For my comment on the 1st ""Back to the Future,"" I mentioned how there aren't too many time travel movies because all the good premises have been used up in a select few sf films (""The Time Machine,"" etc.)... This is never more evident than here, the 3rd & final chapter of the McFly clan and Doc Brown, where-in new cast member Steenbergen essentially duplicates her role from ""Time After Time"" of '79. Once again she is visited by a time traveler (the Doc in this case) and gets swept away by him in grand fantasy fulfillment. Or was this all a sly nod to her earlier film role and that film? In any case, some of the stuff with changing photographs and repetitive motifs (Marty/Fox waking up as Lea Thompson hovers over him) begins to get stale and it's just as well this was the finale. Most of the film takes place way back in 1885, where our heroes need to figure out a way to get their 'time-vehicle' up to 88 mph without fuel.Halfway through, I began to compare this effort to low-end time travel movies such as ""Timerider"" (also a plot involving going back to the old west), which is not a good thing. However, this benefits from the engaging characters we've come to know in the previous 2 films and a lot of silly wordplay on the 'Clint Eastwood' name, which is worth a chuckle. To me, one of the more clever scenes was a pay-off on the foreshadowing of a famous scene from an actual Eastwood movie (""A Fistful of Dollars"" I believe). But almost all the interaction with the western characters was like from some average TV episode, including all the dumb conflict with yet another incarnation of Biff (Wilson), here a foul-looking gunslinger. The romance angle is sort of sweet and the climactic action on the hurtling train is well done, as expected. The final little whammy with Doc & his bride is not too surprising, but I found it interesting no explanation was offered for Doc's triumphant return (wait, that hover-board from the previous film - is that how he did it? - great scott!). The end could have been a set-up for a series titled something like 'Adventures in Time with Doc Brown' but maybe it's just as well nothing like that happened.",Western Genre

"It vexes me no end just how many people are in the habit of calling this the weakest of all the 'Back to the Future' movies �� I'm not going to claim that it's any real patch on the 1985 original, of course, but then again the original was undeniably one movie of a special kind �� innovative, fast-paced and sharply-written, words cannot describe the kicks I still get out of watching it after all these years. Try as they may, neither sequel was quite able to match this golden standard, but at the very least 'Back to the Future Part III' is on equal par with the second film (and at most it's heaps better). While you can look back on 'BTTF Part II' as a loud, flashy and perfectly enjoyable theme park ride of a flick, oozing with thrills and spills but of the somewhat more superficial sort, 'BTTF Part III' has succeeded in toning down all the hyperactivity by a notch, devoting a bigger thrust of time to plot and character and thus making it the superior follow-up all-round. Here, the real backbone of this trilogy �� the friendship between Marty McFly and Doc Brown �� is given a lot more weight than in the previous round, throwing the unlikely duo into all sorts of perilous situations to test their loyalty to each other, and earning it points for warmth and heart. As before, both Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd have tackled their roles brilliantly, and the best laughs continue to come from Marty's sweet na��veness in contrasting the present with the past (if that moon-walking sequence doesn't do it for you, you seriously need to order a new sense of humour �� go try your luck on Ebay). Plus, Doc Brown's new love interest in Mary Steenburgen doesn't serve this movie badly either, even allowing the screenplay a couple of quiet and reflective moments to finally consider some of those philosophical musings that might just cross your mind when you mess with the space time continuum.So although a massive improvement on the 1989 instalment, there are reasons why this never manages to pack quite the same punch as its big father film of 1985. The biggest problem that 'BTTF III' has in setting itself primarily in the Wild West is that it's virtually impossible to pedal clear of the standard clich��s (not to mention forced Western accents) you'll find attached to any level of parody of this genre. And while the vast majority of parallel scenes from the other BTTF movies that are echoed fondly throughout work to good effect, I for one was getting a little tired of Thomas F Wilson always having to crash head-first into a pile of horse manure (it was funny the first couple of times). There's also the rather messy subplot concerning Marty's personal future that had to be carried over here from the previous flick, drilling in a good few extra plot-holes as it goes �� but I'm a big enough fan to turn a blind eye for the most part. In the end, the overall air of this film is far too breezy and good-natured for any of its flaws to have any lasting detriment - it's very entertaining, you can warm to and understand the characters, and with action-adventure movies like this that's all that really matters.Everything considered, in concocting a fun and thoroughly feel-good final chapter to close this adventure and do the original movie justice, they succeeded well enough, enabling you to walk away with pure satisfaction in your heart. After all this time, this still emerges as one of the most memorable and enjoyable cinematic trilogies ever conceived. Godfather what?Grade: a very strong B+",Western Genre
"Back to the Future Part III is so much fun. It is a sweet and entertaining finale to one of the best science fiction trilogies to exist. The first two films have similar ideas and themes, but Robert Zemeckis and company switched things up here. They created an homage to old-school Westerns, a very risky movie considering how westerns were not popular with moviegoers at the time. I loved the references to the westerns of old. Of course Marty would have to say the line, ""uh..Mar..Clint Eastwood."" That line gets me every time. There is a really sweet love story between Doc Brown and Clara Clayton. It surprises me that people seem to dislike their romance. I thought the chemistry existed between the two characters. Furthermore, the film took risks with this romance because it involved middle-aged characters falling in love, and that is never seen in movies. All things considered, Zemeckis took filmmaking risks and they all paid off. In addition, the visuals and special effects stand out. Cinematographer Dean Cundey used the bright desert colors to his advantage. The final action sequence was exhilarating. Marty and Doc had to come up with a way to get the DeLorean to 88 mph without using gasoline. That made this sequence very fun to watch. Even though I believe Part II to be a fun, entertaining film, Part III is better made and a great sendoff.Part II and Part III were shot back-to-back, which was a rarity in the late 80's, early 90's. Filming was a grueling process for Zemeckis. He would be shooting scenes for the third film on location (in places like Monument Valley) then would fly to California to edit the second film. He would repeat the process day after day. While most of the crew found the shoot exhausting, the cast found being away from civilization mostly relaxing. Cundey was also excited about shooting scenes in the barren Western landscape because he was able to take advantage of it. It is not like Zemeckis and screenwriter Bob Gale ran out of time travel ideas when creating the movie. Michael J. Fox actually told the director he always dreamed of making a western. Alas, here we are. There are homages to Westerns everywhere. There are three veteran actors from these films like Harry Carey Jr. Making appearances. The set design, of course, is beneficial to creating the Western landscape. There are even cowboy and Indian scenes! My favorite part is seeing the ancestors of modern-day characters during this era, such as Marty's ancestor, Seamus. Zemeckis's approach was to think about the film as a spiritual human journey. He did succeed.When Marty (Michael J. Fox) destroys the sports almanac, all seems to be well. But that is really not the case. Dr. Emmett Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) and the time machine were struck by lightning leaving the doctor in 1885. Marty receives a letter from Doc essentially telling Marty he is okay and to leave him alone. Marty and Doc's 1955 version find the DeLorean still able to work. Marty finds a gravestone with Doc's name engraved on it, apparently killed by Biff's great-grandfather, Buford Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). Marty takes the DeLorean to save his friend, but the car's gasline is ruptured leaving them both stranded in 1885. They have to figure out how to get out of 1885 which will be very hard considering gasoline did not exist, and by the fact that Doc has his eyes set on the pretty schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen).Through three movies, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to have a natural chemistry with one another. I love their characters so much, so it was cool to see them work magic in a different setting. Lloyd likewise had great chemistry with Mary Steenburgen. Steenburgen took the role because she was hounded by her kids. Her character had such a sweet romance with Lloyd's character. Believe it or not, their kiss was Lloyd's first onscreen kiss. Thomas F. Wilson became a true villain when he stole the almanac last movie, so he made sure to embellish that in Buford. Buford is the best ""Biff"" villain. Lea Thompson did return in a rather thankless performance as Maggie McFly.People generally claim that Back to the Future Part III is the worst of the franchise. It really is not. It has a lot of heart, yet it takes risks. In a time where westerns were not popular, Zemeckis created one...and a good one at that. The romantic scenes between the middle-aged characters are believable. The ending is fantastic. Be prepared to have a tissue or two because tears may be shed. It is clear how much Zemeckis loves this franchise. He went all out on the visual effects to cap the series with an exhilarating end involving a train trying to power a DeLorean. In addition, Alan Silvestri created another powerful score. This is a poignant ending to a monster franchise.My Grade: A-",Western Genre
"Before I get into everything let me say this. I don't hate this movie. I just thought it was a great disappointment to the rest of the trilogy. This movie's more like western mixed with comedy, then a back to the future movie. If you've read my comments on the first two back to the future movies, you can realize how much I loved them. The acting was superb, and the plot outlines and the script... It was wonderful. This movie I felt was just slapped together a bit at last moment. I was waiting for YEARS to see this movie, but my video store never had it. You see I had seen BTTF part2 on tv, before I saw no. 1, and then when we rented out the original BTTF, it didn't ruin it, but... I knew what would happen, yet no. 2 had confused me greatly because I was a little kid, and I couldn't understand why two Michael J. Fox's were running around in 1955, and what the time machine was. It was all very confusing. So like I said I rented no. 1 out, and it all started fitting together. So then I saw number 2 again, and seeing the ""To be concluded"" message, was a bit saddening, but yet I couldn't wait to see the grand finale. So for years the video stores I went to, for some reason never had it. Finaly one day I went there, and they had it, but no copy behind the box cover. SO when I finaly rented the movie out, about 2 weeks after that, the years of waiting had come, I popped open the box slid in the movie, pressed play AND...it got stuck in our VCR. Apparently they must've gotten it second hand, and it was about 6 years old. So then we took our VCR in for them to fix, since it was their film's fault. Lots of things happened, and they ended up forgetting to fix it or something like that. So about another 2 weeks went by, and I forget if they paid for a new VCR for us, but whatsoever, we had to get a new VCR because the other one was unfixable. After that I waited for them to get a new copy in, rented it out. I did the same thing as before, and it got stuck. NO OTHER MOVIE HAD DONE THIS BEFORE..ONLY PART 3 TWICE IN A ROW. This time, i was able to pry the movie out, and took it back, explained, again....and they said the film must've been so dirty inside it just got stuck when it started running. After that we tried different video stores, I was now desperate to see this movie. We finaly found another store with it, and this time the movie worked(GASP!). The beginning of the movie was great, but once he was in 1885...All I can say is this film is ok, but it does not live up to it's predecessors. I'll give it 8 out of 10, in the way of a good movie, but in the way of a sequel...no... a CONCLUSION yet..only 6 out of 10 stars. If you disagree with me, all I can say is you must not of enjoyed BTTF part 1 and 2. Because those, my friends are classic storytelling, at it's very best.",Western Genre
"This 1990 sequel was shot back to back with Back To The Future 2. Again, it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and starred Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. In this, the third and final chapter in the series, Marty McFly (Fox)is transported, thanks to the DeLorean, to the year 1885. The Old West. Alan Silvestri is back and he adds a ""Western"" flavor to the music score. Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox work great together and the story of time travel is a topic I love in science fiction.""Back to the Future 3"" is a well-written, well-directed, well-balanced piece. With an incredible musical score, brilliant acting and excellent composition, the movie reminded me that ""Back to the Future"" was never about action. The effects and everything are mild and tame in this one. Not as exciting as the previous ones. Still, it is a wonderfully made and put together film. It is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. A very satisfying end to the whole saga. All in all, good characters, story telling, and workable effects and acting.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Western Genre
"Continuing the tradition of the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy, Michael J.

The second film saw introduction of Marty's girlfriend Jennifer and the finale saw Clara Clayton, a love interest for Emmett ""Doc"" Brown.The film was set in the 1885 old west, which was a great change. I don't think I would have liked it as much if it was set in 1885 and a regular setting as the viewers witnessed in the first two films.I'm glad I saw this film because it continued to have the same great elements as the first two with the same dialogue and scenes but crafted in such a way that was unique to the trilogy.I was sad to see this great trilogy come to an end but as the cliche goes all good things must come to an end. I can only wonder what would have happened if there more films.If there is anyone who has not seen any of the films in the trilogy, they are missing out on a great piece of nostalgia.",Western Genre
"This is the third and final film from the iconic trilogy ""Back to the Future"", one of the most notable of the 1980s. In this movie, Marty McFly finds himself arrested in 1955 due to the accidental departure of DeLorean after being struck by lightning. But at that very moment, he receives a letter with instructions that ""Doc"" Emmett Brown sent to him from the distant year of 1885, where he himself was imprisoned due to the time machine breakdown. The discovery of the machine and its repair eventually allowed Marty to move to 1885 to try to rescue his friend and to travel safely to the present in 1985.The film is clearly the continuation of its predecessor and has direct connection with it. The mix of sci fi and comedy continues to be successful but this movie is more of the same, the big difference being the trip to the Wild West and the way the movie made humor at the expense of the old westerns. The striking figure of Clint Eastwood, one of the greatest western actors ever, is clearly honored.About Robert Zemeckis's direction, or the cast, I can only restate everything I have said in the reviews of the two previous films. The director did a good job, leaving us in these three films, perhaps one of his most impactful works. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to dominate the film and provide us with excellent dialogue and humorous moments. Thomas F. Wilson, who brought Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (and his descendant Biff) to life, is also performing flawlessly, and Mary Steenburgen is also very good in her role, making a romantic match with Lloyd.Special effects, visuals and sound are an inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie, but they are also important when the task involves recreating a long-time historical epoch, such as the Old West. Here they work quite well. Although not an expert in the field, I think the way the Wild West was recreated in this movie is minimally credible, although things are unlikely to be as the movie shows. The film sought to recreate the old Western, and that was largely achieved.Thus ends the Back to the Future trilogy. Personally, I think this movie is a worthy end for her. The movie is not perfect, could have been improved on some things, but it honored the predecessors and gave the plot a logical close. Like the other two films, this movie has been shown to age well, and we are likely to continue to see it, even on TV, for a few more years.",Western Genre

Never did I imagine, that the last movie of this franchise would hit me right in the emotions in such a profound manner.Albeit I did have a couple of reservations in the previous part but thankfully in this continuation most of those issues have been taken care of. This time around, we got back the innocence, warmth as well as the charm of 1985's original, therefore making it another delightful watch.

"""Marty"" (Michael J Fox) is stuck in 1955 when he learns of the untimely demise of his mentor ""Doc. Brown"" (Christopher Lloyd) back in 1885. Luckily, the DeLorean is on hand and back he goes - to the wild west - to try and prevent this calamity. Once there, he has no idea how to get back; a task not made any easier by local bully ""Mad Dod"" (Tom Wilson) who has it in for this meek city boy from day one. Spielberg is at his best with stories like this, and borrowing heavily from the Western film genre - and quite a bit from Clint Eastwood too, we have a quickly paced an amiable adventure film as Fox and Lloyd have to stay alive whilst figuring out how to charge the flux capacitor and get themselves home. Wilson is super as the ""baddie"" and Mary Steenbergen gives the ""Doc"" a little bit of love interest as the story ticks along nicely. These three films fit nicely with each other, and happily they all decided to hang up their stetsons after this one. It's still great fun 30 years later, with fun pithy dialogue; loads of great action photography and strong entertaining performances all through. Good fun.",Western Genre

"The makers of the BTTF trilogy accomplished their goal: they tie up the McFly/Brown saga very entertainingly with this Old West scenario.Another review mentioned the 'studio look' of the Old West sets, but I didn't see that; they're actually not too bad for this type of movie--especially when compared with Universal comedy-westerns from the 60's and '70's (where everything from the costumes to the horse troughs in front of the saloon looked spotless and brand new, and the women all had perfect, lacquered, teased hair.)
Fox and Lloyd continue their unique chemistry, and the supporting cast is fine: the writers, wisely, didn't overuse the talented Mary Steenburgen and kept the character of Clara from intruding too much into the Marty/Doc dynamic. Thomas F Wilson gets to give a new spin as the antagonist Tannen -this time Western style, and it's my favorite of his 3 villain appearances. All this put together with whiz-bang special effects and deft direction, it's a fine conclusion to a timeless trilogy.",Western Genre

The final installment takes place in the wild west. It is another fine piece of entertainment with Doc Brown finding romance with 	  Clara Clayton which means that Clayton ravine becomes Eastwood ravine. It's probably worth mentioning that a lot of the scenes are replayed 	  in each time zone such as the bar scene. If anyone gets the chance to go to Universal Studios make sure you go on the Back to the Future simulator ride which is the best of it's kind.

"I think it was time to retire the old time machine. The second film got away with being decent, but this film went too far, and the villain (although related to Biff) is not as strong a character. This film is more like a western with native Americans, cowboys, and run-away trains. Yes, it is packed with action, but it is missing that extra edge that the other two films had. It also replaced the comedy element by becoming a little more serious. In short, it just did not do it for me, and it's not a very good film. It weakens the trilogy, in my opinion. I'm glad that they retired the time machine after this to prevent even worse films capitalizing off the title.",Western Genre
"As sad as it is, Back to the Future 3 is the final film in a great series. Every time I watch it, it becomes a little sad, because the characters of Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson have become like family to me, and I don't want to say goodbye to them at all.The last film of the trilogy is the most extraordinary, because here all the action takes place in the Wild West, and, accordingly, the picture has become mostly a western, but not without a fantastic component. All the same beloved characters are present in the frame, but with a funny change - Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen) now plays his ancestor - Bufford Tanenna, the famous bandit. This is the beauty of the plot, because in fact in the entire trilogy there is only one obvious negative character, and with the name Tannen!Also in all the films is the famous Hill Valley cafe, which is in all time periods of history, and in 1885 it was a saloon!Very fortunate in the third film was the fact that Emmett Brown found a lover. And found successfully. Mary Steenbergen played the role of Christopher Lloyd's Clara - a little absent-minded, completely sincere, sweet and fond of Jules Verne. Only such a woman could win the Doc's heart!Of course, at the end of the picture, you feel sorry for the time machine itself. Although Doc Brown made convincing arguments about the dangers of time travel, but in three films she became very dear and close to all viewers. And how delightful it was to see Doc Brown come back from the past, which would seem already unthinkable, in a new time machine-engine and with his family to boot!One cannot but mention the outstanding music of Alan Silvestri, which ranks among the best soundtracks in the world. When the title theme starts to play, goosebumps immediately run through the skin, because it portends amazing adventures and exciting action!Back to the Future 3 is a must-see and recap, because such pictures are becoming less and less common and you should not deny yourself the pleasure. And in the case of Back to the Future, it is guaranteed to be! Sit back and fly at 88 miles per hour!!!",Western Genre

"When many exclaim a sentence similarly to ""bahhh the Wild West one is just stupid"", naturally I enter the film with caution. But after the mess that the DeLorean caused in Part II, it was not going to a be difficult task to improve upon its predecessor. Fortunately, this conclusive chapter brings back the swooning entertainment that produces more swings than saloon doors. Yeah cowboy! All that was missing was Clint Eastwood...oh, wait! Doc, after the events of the second film, is now trapped in western 1885 which sees Marty travel back in time in order to bring him back.Shootouts in the dusty streets, rodeos in the pale moonlight and a spittoon filled with western delight. Zemeckis throws Marty ""Clint Eastwood"" McFly into as much cowboy carnage as possible, allowing ornate exploration into this refreshing aesthetic change. Yet despite the overhaul in production design, it still remains the exact same narrative structure as the original and is unable to detach itself from being a re-hash. The same plot details, for example Marty getting knocked out and waking up in his mother's bed or inventively attempting to push the DeLorean to 88mph (because it's always broken!), are repeated. Beat for beat. And whilst the latter, which involves a cumbersome steam train, was probably the most exhilarating sequence of the entire franchise, the proceeding d��j�� vu story was far too repetitive for the sake of callback humour.The same criticisms from the previous chapter can still be applied here, but with Zemeckis focusing on just one timeline instead of multiple. Acting remains consistent, although Irish Fox was extremely distracting, as does the visual spectacle. Various scenes involving the same actor sharing the screen simultaneously were noticeable as the actors were never looking directly at each other, which again was distracting.However Gale's literary inclusion of Clara, a female plot device for Doc, was a breath of fresh frontier air. Finally enabling some much required emotional development for him, and it proves that a hearty central story is necessary for these films to thrive. It wraps up many convoluted plot strands from Part II (whilst creating a few new ones), but it concludes the trilogy with a heartwarming bow decorated in resolute defiance. Even if Doc hampered on about destroying the time machine for three films yet builds another one from a train just to say ""see you later!"" to Marty (it's the small details people!).Still, a much more entertaining romp than its predecessor which still unfortunately plummets into the ravine of repetition. Yet it does so in a good ol' fashioned western style. Yeehaw!",Western Genre
"Okay, let me just say - Part 3 is not quite as good as the first, nor the second, really. But it has it's strong points. We are reunited with Marty, who discovers that Doc has ended up in the 19th century. The movie unfolds as they race to repair time as best they can without screwing it up any more than they already have.Part 3 is also fun on the grounds that it brings together the two cinematic styles that can be most appealing to young children - science fiction and westerns. I know I thought it was really cool the first time I saw it. Now that I can take a step back and look at it from a technical point of view, it's still not bad. Granted, the script and directing are definitely weaker than the first two films, but this one is basically a necessary installment because, much like the disputed Matrix films, part 2 and 3 both are smaller divisions of a greater unified storyline. the acting is basically just as good as in the first two. If anything drags it down, it is that the western styling can start to feel tedious to someone who isn't really into that type of movie. Still, despite it's various weaknesses, it is a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy, and you can't watch part 2 without part 3.",Western Genre
"1st watched 12/19/2008 - (Dir-Robert Zemekis): Fun and watchable last entry in the ""Back to the Future"" series of movies. In some ways, I actually liked this movie more than the original. This movie provides the first time I ever noticed Christopher Lloyd given a chance to expand his character beyond typecasting and he actually does a very good job with it. His character is given a love interest, who is played by Mary Steenburgen, and he then becomes the main part of the story instead of the Michael J. Fox character. The plot is a twisted mess as usual as it is a time travel story and anytime people move back and forth in time you can never keep track of everything. Of course, this series of movies doesn't take itself very seriously and that's why it works. Its' fun to watch the characters even go so far as making fun of their original characters created in the first movie. An example, is an excellent scene where each character mimics the other by using the other character's patented line. After seeing this, we know we've come full circle in the series. Most of the time in this one is spent in the 1880's(the old west) with Fox's character penning himself as Clint Eastwood and this joke is carried throughout this time period. Doc is a blacksmith(aka. inventor) and their main purpose is getting him back to the future before he's killed in a gunfight. They have to find some way of making the Delorean time machine go at least 88 mph and they use a train to push it up to that speed(with the help of some invention from Doc, of course). Everyone lives happily ever after, as you'd expect, and the series ends on a positive note as far as the movie and how it was received, at least by me.",Western Genre
"Back to the Future was pure fun. Part II was extremely well-made but without the spirit of fun. Now, in Part III, the spirit of fun returns. Unfortunately, this film, despite being enjoyable, is the weakest instalment in the Back to the Future trilogy. It picks up where Part II left off, and is extremely enjoyable. Unfortunately, it would've been so much better had the recreation of the Wild West days been more meticulous. Instead, every clich�� from a Clint Eastwood western is recycled in here (with Marty taking up Eastwood's name, in homage). The result is a more fun film than Part II, but not nearly as strong.In the original film, Marty travels back in time, helps his parents overcome personal problems and get together. Part II had the brilliant idea of giving Marty a problem he struggles with, which people from the places he visits try to help him with. This problem is him being unable to control himself when he is called a name. Part III carries on this subplot, along with a new romantic subplot, which are the film's strongest bits and true joys.The Verdict: Not as strong a sequel as Part II was, but the original's spirit of fun returns in Part III. The result is the weakest instalment of the series, but a fun one to watch nonetheless.Overall Rating: 9/10",Western Genre
It's definitely a little derivative of the previous movies but it's still a fun little western,Western Genre
"After the crazy fast paced special effects extravaganza second film, that takes us to not just 1985 and '55, but also 2015 and 1985A, you'd expect a just as exciting conclusion. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong, as the third film in the series is the slowest, with less plot than any of the others, and less at stake. With that said, the third film also gives a chance to slow down and see Doc and Marty's relationship, and a chance to no longer focus on special effects and cool set pieces, but instead on the characters. It's the least exciting of the three, but still a fairly good end to the trilogy.1985 Doc is stuck in 1885, and according to a grave Marty and 1955 Doc find, 1985 Doc is going to be killed by Biff's great grandfather, cowboy Bufford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. So Marty must travel back to 1885 to stop Doc from being killed, and to get both he and Doc back to 1985. Meanwhile, Doc has fallen in love with Clara (Mary Steenburgen), a science loving resident of 1885. After getting in the middle of things, Marty soon finds that he's the one that will be killed by Mad Dog, and he needs to find a way back.I'll start with the positives on this one. This was the slowest of the films, so it gave a time to stop and really soak up the environment, and linger on the characters. In this way, it was more like the first film than the second. The first one was pretty slow paced, but focused a lot on relationships, and this one does the same thing. The film has a nice atmosphere, and despite not being as impressive a set as the one's featured in the first, and especially the second, the western set is still impressive. This one also wraps itself up nicely, ties up all the loose ends introduced in the second film, addresses all the plot points mentioned in part two, and leaves us with a nice message to sum up the trilogy. The negatives? Well, this film just kind of feels anti-climactic. It's like the first film starts off slow and built up to the crazy fast paced second which is huge and puts everyone's life on the line, and then we get to the third, which is slower than the first film, and only prominently features Marty and Doc from the previous films. The film has somewhat of an exciting climax, that incorporates elements from all three films, but nothing is really new. Most of this stuff is just retread from the first two films, with only a few new elements. This is an entertaining film, and fairly fun, but definitely the weakest of the three films for me. It just feels like it's kind of running out of steam compared to the other two, but the ending leaves a nice message. My rating: *** out of ****. 115 mins. PG for language and violence.",Western Genre
I dont believe that alot of viewers enjoyed this one much because of the whole western bit. Well i did. In fact i enjoyed it alot. I thought it was good for the end of the trilogy. Really where else were they going to go? This was actually the first western movie ive seen. I didnt even like westerns at the time but now that im a big fan of the western genre now i enjoy this movie even more. The whole cast did a great job once again playing various roles and the story line was not all that bad either. For all you western haters put there dont watch it but for anyone else give it a shot.,Western Genre
"When you've done the future, go back to the past. I'm not normally a Western lover but when it's done right (this, The Hateful Eight, Blazing Saddles) it's a thoroughly enjoyable flick, and an amazing way to tie off the trilogy's loose threads and character arcs. A definitive 'The End' to the series...",Western Genre
out of all of the three back to the future movies this one has to be my favourite out of three I remember watching this movie as a kid and enjoying it from the beginning to the end the wild west themes are beautiful in this movie and are very well done I laughed my head off when Marty screamed out Indians when he traveled back in time to the wild west to find Doc Brown Train scene is my favourite out of this whole movie and very well done for exploding scene as well overall a fantastic movie 10/10,Western Genre
"""Back to the Future Part III"" is a heartwarming finale to the iconic trilogy, blending science fiction with a Western twist that many find delightfully engaging. As the third installment, it offers a distinct shift in setting and tone, transporting Marty McFly and the beloved Doc Brown to the rough-and-tumble days of 1885. This time-jumping adventure not only provides the high-octane thrills expected but also weaves in a surprising layer of familial warmth that resonates deeply with viewers.The Western backdrop is richly rendered, offering both a visual treat and a playground for the story's more playful elements. From horseback chases to old-time saloons, the film captures the essence of the genre while maintaining the series' signature whimsical flair. However, it's the development of the characters and their relationships that really makes ""Part III"" shine. The dynamics between Marty and Doc are explored more deeply, providing a satisfying emotional core to the narrative.Clara Clayton, introduced as Doc Brown's love interest, initially seems to intrude on the tight-knit duo. Her character can feel somewhat forced into the storyline, striving to carve a space in an already established dynamic. Nonetheless, as the story unfolds, Clara's inclusion pays off beautifully, adding depth to Doc's character and culminating in a touching conclusion that ties up the trilogy in a meaningful way.Overall, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is a fitting conclusion to a much-loved series, capturing the spirit of adventure and the importance of connections through time. While it may have its minor flaws, the film ultimately delivers a satisfying end to the time-traveling escapades of Marty and Doc. Recommended for fans and newcomers alike, this film deserves a solid 7 out of 10 for its inventive plot and heartfelt execution.",Western Genre
"Having a family friendly movie also set as a western is a limiting factor, but 'Back to the Future 3' manages to overcome most of its hurdles to create the right world while still delivering charm and etiquette for the period.Michael J. Fox is great as usual, although this is his worst performance of the three. Christopher Lloyd has huge amount of screen time and real immersive interactions which bolster the emotions. Mary Steenburgen is charming and wonderful to behold. Tom Wilson is barely recognisable and there have been criticisms about the writing of his character this time around.The opening act and closing acts are the best parts of the film, conveying the story along with correct pacing and excitement, with a sense of using prior knowledge and ideas to bring it all home. However it can be too silly at times as it tries western tropes in a comedic way and fails at them.",Western Genre
"This movie has been underrated from its release to this day. Even the producers and director underrate it.If you see the film out of context of the other two you will watch a nice and well-done Western parody, which on the one hand tries to mock typical cliches and on the other hand conveys something about real life on the Frontier. Isn't it quite funny how the ""educated"" Marty McFly falls for every cliche he has seen on TV? Even the gunmen (Tannen and his gang), who themselves try hard to *be* the feared Jesse James' of their valley, are baffled by Marty's view on the West.Almost everything that connects this part to the other two is nothing more than icing on the cake, knitting together some loose ends (i.e. Marty's inability to play the guitar). It doesn't add anything to the characters or plot or story. Nonetheless these in-jokes are brilliantly executed, coming nice and easy, not with big fanfare.I really recommend this film - although, let it be noted that it is not the brilliant and innovative movie that *Back to the Future * is. Or s dark a satire as the second part; it's just plain old fun with real characters.",Western Genre
"Alright, fellow BTTF devotee, prepare to mosey on back to 1885 with Back to the Future Part III! Now, I know what you're thinking': ""Worst"" of the trilogy? Sacrilege! But hey, even a dusty tumbleweed in the Back to the Future universe is still kinda awesome, right? So, let's saddle up and see if this wild west adventure delivers yeehaw-worthy entertainment or leaves us with tumbleweed tumbleweeds of disappointment.First things first, let's giddy-up with the good stuff: Doc Brown's stuck in the Wild West! And who else but our favorite time-travelin' teen, Marty McFly, is gonna hightail it back to 1885 to save him? This movie throws us into a rootin' tootin' good time with shootouts, saloons, and a showdown with Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen that'll have you chewin' on your popcorn faster than a jackrabbit on a hot tin roof. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are, as always, a comedic dream team, their chemistry as strong as ever (even with Doc sporting a questionable handlebar mustache). Plus, the addition of Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton, a spunky schoolteacher with a hidden sharpshooting talent, adds a delightful new dimension to the mix.Now, let's talk about the aspects that might not be as shiny as a gold pocket watch: Compared to the mind-bending timelines of Part II, the plot in Part III feels a tad simpler, more focused on the classic ""hero saves the day"" trope. Sure, there's still some time-travel shenanigans with the ol' trusty DeLorean (powered by... horse manure? Don't question it!), but it doesn't quite reach the same level of complexity. And let's face it, some of the Western stereotypes and humor might feel a bit dated to modern audiences.But here's the rootin' tootin' truth: Back to the Future Part III, despite its minor stumbles, is still a ridiculously entertaining movie. It's a love letter to classic Westerns, packed with action, humor, and heart. The characters are charming, the setting is unique, and the story, while familiar, delivers a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Plus, who can resist Doc Brown yodeling his way through a saloon brawl?Verdict: 7 out of 10 spurs. Back to the Future Part III might not be the most groundbreaking entry in the trilogy, but it's a charming, funny, and action-packed conclusion that sends the franchise out with a bang (or should I say, a gunshot?). So, saddle up, partner, and enjoy the ride! Remember, even time travel adventures with a few rough patches can still be a blast from the past (or future, depending on your perspective).",Western Genre
"In the final part of the back to the future trilogy we end up in the wild west. Which doesn't make any sense whatsoever since the hill valley is located in California but who cares with a movie this much fun. Anyway on to the plot: In order to save the doc from dieing marty goes back to 1885 to save him only to damage the delorean. Getting them both stuck in the past. While the doc falls in love and marty gets himself into more trouble than he can handle, they still have to find a way to get back to the future.The biggest problem in this movie is the fact that some of the village sets were never finished which was probably beyond anyones control at the time. While it makes sense that some things are still under construction it ultimately just looks cheap. Another thing that doesn't quite work is that while the movie is a parody on western it also tries to be a serious western at times.Thankfully the characters and the humor are still as strong as they were in the first two films and westerns are still a loads of fun making Back to the Future part 3 a decent ending of a great trilogy with a wild ride in the wild west.",Western Genre
"My Take: Not the strongest in the hit series, but strong enough to keep the series moving.When it finally reached Part III, the BACK TO THE FUTURE series has certainly showed its age. The film's lack of the ingenious ideas that the first films had isolates this from the first two. The film is more of a Western comedy for most part of the film, but not a bad one. Still at the hands of the highly creative crew of Robert Zemeckis (director,co-writer), Bob Gale (writer) and Steven Spielberg (executive producer), BACK TO THE FUTURE III (which was shot back-to-back with Part II) doesn't succumbs to sequel dreadfulness, something that other sequels usually fall upon.The film is not as special effects laden as the second, nor as the first. Although it would probably have been for the best, it lacks the pure high-concept fun. The film rests itself as a Western comedy for most of the time, including a quirky love story between the series' best character Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and fluent schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). McFly also challenges the toughest gunman in the West named the ""Mad Dog"" Tennen (Thomas F. Wilson), presumably Biff Tennen's ancestor. For most parts, its a less effects-driven comedy, with more emphasis on comedy.The path taken by this sequel makes it less crowded and confusing as the second in the series, but it also lacks the manic charms. The original was more lively for most of the time, and it had more ideas while the second film moved at a fast pace with fun at every corner. This film settles to heavily on a Western comedy mode, which makes it rather lacking.But the overall effect is still a good movie. Not as good as I hoped, and this one is the least that holds up among the three films, but I liked it and why wouldn't I. The script, although not filled with the clever time-travel hokum that I loved in the first two, is still cleverly filled with deft comedy bits and appealing characters. It's often tired and repetitive, but there's still so much to recommend.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Western Genre
"I know the conventional wisdom is that Back to the Future Part III is the weakest film in the trilogy. And while it's certainly the least original - it's a Western remake of the original Back to the Future - but it's my personal favourite. Beginning exactly where Back to the Future Part II left off (you need to watch these movies in chronological order or you WON'T get them). Marty (with the 1955 Doc Brown's help) heads back to 1885 to save Doc, who is about to be murdered by Biff Tannen's great-grandfather, Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. But once he arrives in 1885, the DeLorean was damaged by an Indian arrow - leaking all the fuel (irreplaceable) and rendering the car out of service for the next several decades. Doc and Marty must try and find a way to get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour - while at the same time staying out of Tannen's hair. But things are further complicated when Doc falls in love with a teacher.Again, the movie's a remake of the original. But it's a fun remake, but all the charm, humour, and climatic almost-doesn't-make-it tension that fans have come to expect. What effects are used are quite good. It also provides a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy (and yes, it's a definite conclusion). A great movie.",Western Genre
"BTTF3 is a good closing of the trilogy. Although I have to say it's probably the weakest of the three, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. All the actors portray their characters with the usual greatness, and I especially love the climax of the movie where Doc and Clara get stuck on the train. I also thought the ""Jules & Verne"" thing was really cute.....ooops, I better not give away all of the secrets to the movie! Although BTTF is really sci-fi, Western fans can enjoy this one, too. All-in-all, a great way to end an excellent trilogy. You have to see BTTF3.-2001RulzP.S.-Although I love all the BTTF movies, I really hope they don't make a BTTF4. I mean, what could they possibly make it about? I think it would be a major waste of time and money, and it would be one heck of a job getting the original actors to come back. And I'm sure the almost-40-year-old Michael J. Fox is willing to play a teenager again......Just keep things the way they are now. BTTF4 would lack original material and wouldn't appeal to the rather dumb majority of teens today. Nowadays, almost every teenager wants a movie with violence, sex, cussing, and really hot guys & babes. And BTTF (fortunately) does not have these things. As a great man once said, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Thanks. :-)",Western Genre
"I loved this movie, it was the best one of all The Back To The Futures.A perfect Wild west film, for people who like Wild west movies, and also having Emit and Clara fall in love was nice, I've seen this movie a lot of times.Except I've seen the TV edited version so some bad words are edited out of the TV version, and Marty using an alias name like Clint Eastwood was a nice touch.Mind as well just have a different name, even though it seemed like Shamus (Sp) knew that Marty was related too them, because he said too Maggie it felt like he was connected to them, and the train scene was awesome, but I bet that now the special affects would be better now then they were back in 1990.LuvzHannah",Western Genre
