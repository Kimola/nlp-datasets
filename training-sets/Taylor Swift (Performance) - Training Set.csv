the concert was amazing her new album lit up the stage!!!,Best Concert Ever
"Taylor Swift delivered an absolutely magical performance! From the moment she stepped on stage, the entire stadium was on fire with excitement. She took us on a journey through all her eras—singing hits from Fearless to 1989, Lover, and even her latest songs. Every single detail, from the stunning visuals to the flawless choreography, was perfection.

Taylor’s connection with her fans is unreal. She spoke to the crowd like we were old friends, sharing stories behind her songs and even surprising us with acoustic versions of some deep cuts. Her vocals were incredible, and the emotional energy in the room gave me chills. You could feel the love and passion she pours into every performance.

The crowd was singing every word, the light-up bracelets synced with the music, and the whole night felt like a dream. If you ever get the chance to see Taylor Swift live—DO NOT miss it. It’s more than just a concert; it’s an experience you’ll never forget!",Magical Experience

"Words are truly not enough to fully encapsulate the energy, excitement and impressiveness that was The Eras Tour. Having seen the show on 3 separate occasions (Seattle and Vancouver x2), I never grew tired of walking through those stadium gates; the eager concert goers trading friendship bracelets with everyone they saw, the sparkling outfits that you know took months and months of preparation, the Swift-themed menu items, the spontaneous singalongs...and this was all before Taylor took the stage. The show itself felt more like a fever dream than a concert. The talent, coordination, composure and athleticism required to put on such a production is something that will be studied in high regard for years to come. The set flowed immaculately and went by in a blink, despite it being 3h long. Between the inside jokes, traditions old and new and overall classic Taylor Swift dazzling energy, this was a tour made for the fans, and it did not disappoint. Truly one of the best shows I have ever had the privilege of seeing. I will remember this tour all too well in the most enchanting way. Long Live the Eras Tour <3",Taylor Swift's Energy

"The Eras Tour has been one of the best experiences of my live (and I haven‘t been a Swiftie in the at first). 
Speaking of the Swifties: The overall experience around the actuall show is just lovely and wholesome! Everyone is happy and wants to have a good time. 
The world would be a better place if it would be more like a TS show with the Swifties around. 

More than 3hrs pure joy and fun with a fast-track thru Taylor‘s career.",Magical Experience

Going to The Eras Tour was definitely the best day of my life and such an indescribable experience!

"All I can say is wow!!! My city definitely rolled out all the things for the last shows of The Eras Tour. I ended up getting a ticket to N1 from a complete stranger in Detroit. She gifted her behind the stage ticket to a lucky Swiftie🫶 

Getting into gate C was a little crazy as we had to cross over to Rogers Arena and then finally cross the street. The line went all the way back to Pacific. Although once in line it only took about 20 min to get in. 

I didn’t bother with merch as I went to Canada Place a couple of days before. Once I got to my seat I was pleasantly surprised that they had put screens up for the behind the stage seats. 

The overall vibes were awesome and the show was amazing. I’m still in awe and pinching myself that I got to go in the end. Great job BC Place and Vancouver!

Long Live The Eras Tour💕",Magical Experience

"All I can say is wow!!! My city definitely rolled out all the things for the last shows of The Eras Tour. I ended up getting a ticket to N1 from a complete stranger in Detroit. She gifted her behind the stage ticket to a lucky Swiftie🫶 

Getting into gate C was a little crazy as we had to cross over to Rogers Arena and then finally cross the street. The line went all the way back to Pacific. Although once in line it only took about 20 min to get in.

"Untouchable is what The Eras Tour is and was! I had the time of my life fighting dragons with everyone that was there in person, and via the grainy livestreams. While I will always always wish that many a bot didn’t get their hands on tickets to resell via third party sites, I can’t help but appreciate that Taylor and her team also offered “no view” seats for the final weekend. That said, our seats still had an incredible view with the added bonus of seeing the entire tour crew in a behind the scenes style way. We sang, shook it off, cried, cheered (1-2-3 LGB), and left glitter on the floor after the party.",Incredible Performance

"It's Taylor Swift. It's the Eras Tour. So of course the show itself was incredible!!! I also saw her at Levi Stadium last summer and loved it then, too.
The reason for only 4 out of 5 stars: Unfortunately for the Vancouver show, I was in section 455, and there was a light structure on the floor with pyrotechnics on top that totally blocked center stage and the center of the big screen. The only other screens were relatively small and at the top of BC Place. Because of this, me and those around me missed out on a lot. Having traveled from CA and having paid a lot for my ticket, this was pretty disappointing.",Incredible Performance

"My daughter and I came from L
Prince George for the last show of her tour and we experienced a seminal moment in both our lives. Everyone that we ran into from fans to staffers, security and venders we so unbelievably warm and friendly!  I was so happy, myself, that I got to dance (and hard) to some of my favourites: ‘Cruel Summer’, ‘Lover’, ‘Delicate’, ‘Are You Ready for It’ and ‘Don’t Blame Me’  and then ‘Willow’ and ‘Betty’ later on. I love Taylor Swift so I wasn’t too surprised how much I was going to enjoy her.  The real ‘magic’, for me was getting to experience the raw, unbridled emotion that poured out from my daughter when Taylor played her ‘surprise’ songs, starting with ‘New Romantics’. Seeing my daughter, Jorja, exasperated trying to catch her breath as she realized what Taylor was playing and seeing the tears stream down her face, without remission, made me lose all control and I cried inconsolably.  The bonds that were forged between dad and daughter over the entire weekend were made possible because of the flawless show that we were able to attend.  Well done Ticketmaster as well for making it so easy to redeem our on -line tickets. 
Can’t wait to do another Ticketmaster event , hopefully sooner than later;

The real ‘magic’, for me was getting to experience the raw, unbridled emotion that poured out from my daughter when Taylor played her ‘surprise’ songs, starting with ‘New Romantics’. Seeing my daughter, Jorja, exasperated trying to catch her breath as she realized what Taylor was playing and seeing the tears stream down her face, without remission, made me lose all control and I cried inconsolably.  The bonds that were forged between dad and daughter over the entire weekend were made possible because of the flawless show that we were able to attend.  Well done Ticketmaster as well for making it so easy to redeem our on -line tickets. 
Can’t wait to do another Ticketmaster event , hopefully sooner than later;

I loved the concert! But getting tickets is what was very hectic. Also the prices were very extreme even for other artists not to mention when others were re selling them. Need a better solution and system. The concert though was an amazing experience and feel so lucky I got to experience it. I hope I’m just as lucky to go the next time,Ticketing Issues

"We attended the last Taylor Swift Concert in Vancouver. It was a ""great show""but, it felt more like a stage-show on Broadway - very scripted. Taylor Swift appeared like she was going through the motions, and there was no personal engagement with the crowd. Her comments were the same across the three nights in Vancouver. No comment about it being her last show, rather a general comment about the end of Eras Tour. It felt like the ""elephant in the room""within the stadium - the last show of the Eras Tour, but no acknowledgement of this. This seemed like a running commentary as we left the stadium.

The show lacked the spontaneity and involvement of other concerts. This was dissapointing. She appeared understandably done with the tour. But, perhaps it's lengthiness was too much. I would have been happy with less of a production and more of the great singer she is.",Overall Organization

"Finding the words to encapsulate my eras tour experience seems impossible but I’m going to do my best because I feel like I have to say something. Like everyone else, I tried to get tickets for this tour at every opportunity. My friends and I were willing to go anywhere at any time as long as we could get tickets, but it didn’t work out over and over again. One last time I registered for verified fan when the Vancouver dates were released. Once again I got waitlisted, but while on a work trip to Toronto I got a text in the airport that I was cleared from the waitlist and suddenly the moment I was chasing for over a year was right in front of me. I surprised my best friend with these tickets for her birthday 3 weeks after I bought them with custom friendship bracelets with the show date and location. Fast forward 1 year and 29 days and there we are in Vancouver for the last ever eras tour show. Everything worked out exactly the way it was meant to and I feel that in my soul. I’ll never get over being about to be part of the cultural movement that was the eras tour, from talking my about every detail of the show with my friends, going to see the movie in theaters, trading friendship bracelets with girls at brunch before the show to spending hours and hours and hours bedazzling a body suit to wear to the show, to finally experiencing it live with my best friends. Thank you Taylor Swift, for existing in the same timeline as me and for bringing the magic and joy of girlhood to an all time high and giving us all the confidence and self worth to exist as our truest and most authentic selves. I laughed, I cried (a lot), and embraced the women in my life I love so much.  And I can confidently say, I have been changed for good.",Fan Community

"getting into the arena was a bit difficult. there were long snaky lines throughout many parts of downtown vancouver. while i understand a large amount of people have to get through a small opening at the same time, i felt this could’ve been handled better, especially since it was the third (and final) night. for instance, a guard was directing foot traffic through cones and caution tape, while stating that sometimes the other gate (gate h) opens up, but she had no idea when it would. when i was about to the front of gate b, gate h suddenly opened, causing a slew of concert goers to rush over and disrupt the coned off line. there were also no lights around this part of the stadium, causing a bit of a safety issue as there are many stairs. i felt the overall foot traffic could’ve been directed better, as this was the final night in the city with the same amount of crowd. i completely understand that many concert goers were uninformed, standing around, causing and incredible inconvenience for those actively fighting to get into a line, but a stronger presence of direction could’ve resolved this issue. for instance, an email explaining gate information, times, and closures would’ve been helpful for those who have never visited the city. clear ‘start’ signs to show where lines begin would’ve also been helpful since may were traveling from all street directions. an appropriate amount of gates open to better control the influx of foot traffic also would’ve been confident. overall, staff did a great job of trying to control the crowd, but a little more guidance would’ve been helpful. thank you to all who made this experience possible!",Overall Organization

The screen was right there which was nice, but since there was one screen and it had been programmed to mostly show the backgrounds and supporting graphics for each of the eras, we often didn’t get to see what Taylor was doing.

Taylor Swift gives her all in her performances. A true artist. The venue was good although the offerings of food and drinks were not great. And after receiving a note that bags had to be a certain size- I brought that size of bag that fit just my phone and credit cards. As we tried to go through the gate I was accosted 5 times by people insisting my bag was too big and would have to check it for $40. I was clearly not happy.  Thankfully the concert was perfect!,Incredible Performance

"We had seen Taylor at the beginning of the eras tour and wanted to see her again after she released TTPD.   That part was fantastic.  However, we learned that our show (the very last show of the tour)  was 20 minutes shorter than the night before and also didnt include a Gracie Abrams duet like the night before.  In fact, my daughter noticed she didnt speak to the crowd very much and she was right.  I understand Taylor was exhausted Im sure at the end of eras, as she should be, but it felt like she was already gone.  That being said, the Venue and Vancouver were amazing.  They put a Taylor lit sign and friendahip bracelet installation all over the city.  What a wonderful surprise!",Amazing Production

"First, I would like to tell that the concert was perfect. Taylor is an amazing singer and her and her team’s performance was impeccable. However, I am very disappointed with Ticketmaster sales, because my family and I couldn’t be able to join any queue. Although there are a bunch of people who can get tickets and resale those for extremely overpriced costs. It is very unfair. Since I thought that Ticketmaster’s register fans policy was to avoid resales and scams.",Incredible Performance

"We paid extra for floor tickets. Unfortunately, it was really challenging to see anything at all due to the lay out of the floor. Additionally, many people were allowing their children to stand on the seats which made it near impossible to see the show. There were people with signs stating not to stand on the seats walking up and down the isles but nothing was enforced and there were several children standing on seats. I had children with me as well and wouldn’t allow them on the seats which made them pretty upset seeing all the other kids do it, and they couldn’t even see the screen due to others standing on the seats.",Ticketing Issues

"I had floor seats in section B5 on the FINAL NIGHT OF THE ERAS TOUR. Row 4- the dream seats. Center stage. And the professional filmographer almost completely blocked the concert for most of us in seats 6-10. (He was lined up with the main walkway). The only time we got a clear view of the stage is when the filmographer dropped down as Taylor came downstage.

Most of our section were short girls, and we couldn't even see the big screen a lot of the time. Some gave up and just sat down. 

Overall, the Taylor was excellent and thankfully there was a screen kind of overhead that I could look up to for most of the concert! It was just a bummer to have those seats and then not have them be as good as they should have been",Taylor Swift's Energy

It was an amazing concert. Glad I went. I don't like it when talent lets the crowd cheer or screech for them for a long time without stopping it. I don't need to go deaf. The wrist lights were an amazing idea. The opening act needed a better sound check. I could not make out the lyrics of her songs. I wasn't the only one around me that couldn't make out what she was saying. While waiting for the concert to start I thought they could of done better with the Taylor footage. I couldn't hear a lot of what she was saying and I did not want to see her in a mask. She looked beautiful and I loved all of her costume changes.,Amazing Production

"I've listened to Taylor Swift since she released her debut album and subsequent albums since. I called myself a casual Swiftie at best or simply a listener, however, until I went to Santa Clara N2. The Eras Tour profoundly changed my life. You don't realise how many events of your personal or professional life are intertwined and intersect with Swift's works until the opening of her concert, finding yourself overwhelmed with a surge of emotions abruptly. It reminds you she's not simply someone on the other side of your headphones.

I typically only go to concerts at small jazz venues. Do you wave? That feels weird. I guess this is why she wrote TTPD, a masterpiece of her lived experiences—the crowd was chanting ""more"". When she tours again, I'll dance my feelings out again, be done with school (I decided to go back during her Speak Now set at Santa Clara), and remember this beautiful end of a 149-concert run in Vancouver with my friends.",Emotional Connection

"The absolute joy and happiness the show brought to my heart cannot be described with words. I was a fan of Taylor’s before seeing her I concert, but now I can call myself a certified S W I F T I E!! She (and her back up performers) are absolutely brilliant. The production was out of this world. But my favorite was being packed in a stadium with beautiful women (and men) everywhere. All were there for the same reason - no permission was needed to dance like on one in watching, become their authentic selves, and scream Taylor’s music at the top of their lungs in complete expression.

It’s just amazing the amount of work her and her team put into this show. I went to Toronto N2 and it was euphoric, truly.

To experience every album this woman has given us and to go through her discography like this was truly out of this world. No artist does it like her. 3.5 hour show that she is on stage performing!? With no breaks!? Insane. She is so talented. Her live vocals are beautiful. The way she interacts with the fans and makes everyone feel seen even the ones in the nose bleeds is like no other. You can truly tell she loves and cherishes her fans. The production, the visuals, her dancers, her band, and TAYLOR were just so great and amazing and put on one hell of a show.

We flew to Austria in August and were devastated we did not get to see her, but grateful everyone was safe! Didn’t think it was possible to see her, but we managed to pull it together for this show to finish what we started, and so thankful it all worked out! Love you Taylor!",Ticketing Issues

When she did walk our way it was so fast and she didn’t even look at us in the front row for paying as many thousands as I did a little eye contact would be nice I was also at one of the last 3 shows in Vancouver and I thought she would do something special but there wasn’t anything the other shows didn’t have. The nice thing was there was lots of access to water and never a wait for the washroom.,Ticketing Issues

The Eras Tour was hands down the best concert that I ever went to. Taylor takes you through each era of her music and even if you are seeing her for the first time or have seen her for multiple times it feels as if you have been apart of her musical journey since the beginning. Her tour production is out of this world and her vocals sound amazing live! Truly an incredible night that I did not want to end. If ever given the chance to see her perform live I fully recommend buying a ticket. I’m already looking forward to the next time she goes on tour.,Best Concert Ever

"I don't even know where to begin! This was the most phenomenal concert experience of my life. 
From the second Taylor stepped on stage until the final bows, the entire crowd was absolutely captivated.
Every single detail was perfect. The theatrics were mind-blowing, the costumes were stunning, and the way the setlist flowed through all her musical eras was genius. The light show and pyrotechnics were out of this world, and the wristbands that lit up and synced with the music created the most magical atmosphere.
Taylor's energy was infectious! She poured her heart and soul into every song for 3.5 hours straight. It was an emotional rollercoaster, filled with joy, nostalgia, and pure magic. This is a night I will cherish forever.
If you ever get the chance to see Taylor Swift live, DO IT! You won't regret it.",Magical Experience

"Taylor Swift puts on an amazing concert. FIVE STARS for the concert itself. 2 STARS for the VIP tickets.  I thought the VIP tickets that we bought for a big upcharge did not include half the things it said it would. There was no VIP entrance, No dedicated merchandise section, the seats we had were not cushioned and actually had an obstructed view. There was a camera tower that blocked the center of the stage. I think I would have been just as happy paying $200 for regular seats.  All we got was a tote bag, some posters and postcards. We got a VIP badge that did nothing for us as well. I felt taken advantage of.  The seats did not correlate to what was portrayed when we bought the tickets. The concert itself was absolutely amazing 🤩",Ticketing Issues
Taylor Swiftvwad amazing. Worth every penny! BC Stadium is by far he WORST venue I have seen a show at. All the concrete surfaces create terrible reverb/echos with the treble/high end.,Ticketing Issues
"While the concert was amazing, the events leading up to it were not. I, along with friends and family, registered to be selected to purchase TS tickets on Ticketmaster back in August 2023. There were 12 accounts all together, and NOT ONE OF US, got access to the sale. I was able to buy tickets off of my cousin TWO DAYS before the concert. She managed to get tickets on a drop TM did after the stage was set up. It was very sad to see so many tickets go to resellers for profit. I tried for 16 months to get face value tickets!!!",Ticketing Issues

The concert was spectacular. Everything about her show is meticulously planned and Taylor is clearly in a league of her own. Her dancers, band and backup singers are also just fabulous. The crowd was so amped and loud, but she sounded clear and great. I would go again and again…. I hope I get another opportunity to see her.",Taylor Swift's Energy

Having attend her Eras Tour, not once, but twice, I think should speak for itself. I have never once been in a single place where nearly 65000 people- not just women/girls, were so unapologetic about their happiness and were loud in expressing it. I am so thankful for Taylor creating these safe spaces for everyone to get together, dance, since, and love together. So many memories created.

"This was an incredible experience that I shared with my three kids, aged 18, 15 and 11. It is a rare occurrence to have their interests intersect and to have them be equally engaged. This felt like an unbelievable gift from the universe. On top of that, Taylor Swift and her crew deliver a show-stopping, state of the art, creative experience for 3+ hours. Taylor deserves all the accolades as a songwriter and performer - she has raised the bar of what fans can expect from their favourite artists!",Long Show Duration

"Taylor Swift was fantastic! The arena was electric with high energy and anticipation as the clock ticked down to the opening. I had tears & goose bumps when she appeared to open her show. I watched the fans around me, of all ages, singing along. I watched the lights throughout the audience and stage, and it was incredible how it all worked together, so impressive! The coreography, dancers, singers were great and they looked like they were having fun. 
Most impressive was Taylor's performance! Over 3 hours of, singing, dancing, playing guitar and piano... high energy & emotion throughout. It was an experience I will never forget!",Taylor Swift's Energy

"The Eras Tour was an absolutely magnificent experience. It was so much more than just a concert. I had the time of my life trading friendship bracelets, chatting with Swifties, interacting with all of the venue staff, and watching this once-in-a-lifetime performance by the most talented artist. Taylor is so sincere and genuine, and it's obvious that she puts everything she has into putting on the best show for her audience. I've been to many concerts, but I've never been a part of something as special as the Eras Tour. Taylor's band and dancers were incredible. The stage itself was such a marvel. The entire production of this show was remarkable. I feel very lucky to have been able to witness Taylor Swift perform.

"What an amazing artist and performance, if you can some how manage to go.. then do it! Be aware that you will become an instant 'Swiftie' after seeing the Eras Tour.

I do wish that Ticketmaster was more regulated and that surge pricing/ and the resales of tickets for 10 times the original price were not able to occur.  This would prevent the hacking and scamming that follows suit.  I was so stressed out about potentially have my tickets hacked from my account.  None of that would have to occur if TM wasn't allowed to inflate the prices and or allow the resellers to do the same.",Ticketing Issues

"We paid over $1,000 in the presale for each VIP ticket. For other legs of the tour, VIP came with actual perks that seemed to make it worthwhile. All we received was a box of low cost merch (posters, stickers, a tote bag), but did not receive what is normal for VIP (early entry, access to merch, VIP concession area). The logistics cause us to spend extra time in lines, miss getting exclusive merch etc. Felt like a bait and switch.  Concert was great though and Rogers Centre staff members were very friendly.",Ticketing Issues

"The Eras Tour has surpassed the categorization as a “concert” and drifted into the zeitgeist of “cultural wave.” The positivity, kinship, and community that Ms Swift has curated will go down in history. We will be telling our grandchildren about the electricity in the air before she took the stage, the dozens of friendship bracelet trades, and the kind comments from strangers about the beautiful our homemade outfits were for the show. Never have I ever felt safer in a crowd than at this event. It was the honour of a lifetime to hear songs from my youth alongside swifties of all ages. It is an understatement to say that we have been changed for the better after night 6 of the Toronto show. Truly a transformative evening for all in attendance, Taylor put on an exhilarating marathon performance. It is a shame how difficult it was for fans to be in attendance, how the lottery favoured a few and was the detriment to the majority of her fans. What a lost opportunity to improve the ticket buying system, a disappointment to the true music fans who missed out on building community together inside the venue. I can only hope that we learn from our missteps and keep fans top of mind moving forward.",Fan Community

"I went to Toronto N5, and long story short: It was the best night of my life. After years of listening to her music, this was my first time ever seeing Taylor live and I was not disappointed one bit (there was a 0% chance of an ounce of disappointment being in my body anyway). Toronto was totally in the Swiftie spirit and I loved it! It  made me even more excited to get into the stadium. Gracie opened for Taylor and she did AMAZING! My life was changed when I heard the Free Now bridge live. I hope to see Gracie in concert again! When Taylor came on I was full on sobbing. Who wouldn’t be? (Everyone around me…lol). I got to hear some of my childhood favourite songs live like Shake It Off and I Knew You Were Trouble, it was great! Taylor did such an amazing job performing and so did her dancers. I don’t even have words for just how much of an impressive performer she is. She performs for 3+ hours with insanely short breaks, it’s insane. Her stage is amazing, people aren’t lying when they say there isn’t a single bad seat at the Eras Tour. I was in section 527 and I saw EVERYTHING. I saw (and felt) the bad blood flames, the stage visuals, the flashing lights - everything. It was magical. I truly do hope to see Taylor in concert again the next time she decides to tour, I love her.",Amazing Production

The city itself did an excellent job (way to go Tayronto). Everything about this show blew me away and I loved it. Sucks that Ticketmaster handled the sale horribly, but luckily I was chosen.

"Everything about this show was magical! From the moment we purchased tickets until the moment we left the Rogers Centre, everything went smoothly! It was stressful getting tickets in the first place because it was like winning the lottery to even get a pre-sale code but, once we had the tickets, we patiently waited over a year until it was time and WOW was it ever worth it! I would have waited a lifetime if I knew I’d get to see a show of that calibre. The whole production was seamless and, if there were any technical difficulties, we certainly couldn’t tell. Taylor Swift and her whole crew are total rockstars and work so professionally - we wouldn’t have been able to tell of anything went “wrong” because they perform with such strength and confidence, making everything look effortless! Every aspect of the show was captivating — her vocal performance and stage presence, their choreography, the stage set up and effects, the lighting/light show — even getting in and out of the Rogers Centre was a breeze! We were blown away by the bracelets given to every attendee that were somehow programmed to turn on a different points, in different rhythms and with various colours. The food and drinks available to purchase were a bit overpriced but delicious, and the price is to be expected at a stadium. The merchandise was cleverly set up in various sections of the building and, although lots of items were sold out, it was arranged in a way that ensured fans could at least see if there was anything they’d like to stand in line to get a chance to purchase.

"I'm beyond disappointed. We purchased original tickets in A4, Row 24 which we believed to be premium seating near the stage. In reality I missed most of the show due to obstruction of the stage, watching the show from behind Taylor for most of the show. Was seated beside a tall person and had difficulty even watching the jumbo screen to see the show. I eventually just sat down, closed my eyes and listened. Taylors show was heavily supported by special lighting and details in the middle stage. Lesson learned. I'm now forever buying seats high in the stands and never want to have floor seating again. Please provide a description for seating when you sell it. Create a checklist of what you will see but also what you won't see. Sadly, I saw very little of the show.",Ticketing Issues

Taylor Swift puts on an amazing concert. She doesnt stop and her costume changes are so quick. Her back up dancers are very talented dancers. I was in awe. This 3.5 hour concert went by so fast and when it was over i was actually sad and immediately wanted to watch it again. I can completely understand why these girls and young women are becoming SWIFTIES.  I am 55 and a new SWIFTIE! THANK YOU TAYLOR SWIFT 💓,Amazing Production

"Not only am I the best Mom in the world for securing tickets, but I am now apart of the sisterhood of Swifties. Taylor is probably the greatest show-woman I have ever seen in concert. This was my daughters first concert and she still hasn't come down from the high of the night. GREATEST NIGHT EVER!",Fan Community
"It was a night to remember. I’m so lucky to have been able to attend. Many fans wanted to attend and couldn’t.

"The concert was absolutely amazing and Taylor was incredible. My issue lies with the VIP experience we got. We paid a fortune for VIP thinking we were going to get early access to the venue, our own merch booths, a VIP lounge/bar and we received none of these things, which did not make the price worth it at all. I would have purchased regular tickets had I known the rogers centre wouldn’t participate in any of the day of VIP perks. A bit disappointing for how expensive the tickets were.",Ticketing Issues

So much energy, everyone was so nice and everyone was engaged and locked in on every song. The standing ovation was the loudest and longest I’ve ever heard. I think even Taylor was taken back.

"The show itself was AMAZING, no complaints regarding the performance Taylor put on. However, my friends and I bought the Karma is Boyfriend package and disappointed for the price is an understatement. As we travelled to the show from another province we felt the that the originally promised perks of crowdless merch lines and early entry into the stadium was worth it to ensure we got the merchandise we wanted.  However, come show day we did not receive any of the perks for vip tickets that were promised to be apart of the package at the time we purchased the tickets, nor were we informed of this change to the package OR refunded for removing these perks. We found out through research that these perks were actually no longer part of the package a week before our show. With the chaos of Toronto and early merch days we attempted to try and get merch early to guarantee we got what we wanted, however, this was not the case despite lining up early. We attempted the merch line 3 different days and still did not get the correct sizes we wanted as they had sold out within minutes. Part of this problem was the fact that there was no limit on how many items people could buy, so we saw multiple people walk out with multiples of the highly coveted blue crew necks and grey quarter zips. Another issue we encountered was the lack of organization when it came to entry into the stadium. We asked multiple workers where we should be standing in line and they had no clue and pointed us in a general direction. With this disorganized entry into the stadium, we ended up standing the wrong line for approximately an hour. As for the vip box that was supposed to be shipped to our house before the show did not arrive until after our show date I cannot speak to the quality of the merch in those boxes but can say that with the removed perks on show day in general the VIP karma is my boyfriend package was a waste of money and not worth it. Just another way to take advantage of and up charge swifties who want to see to see their favourite artist in person.",Ticketing Issues

"We were lucky enough to score some tickets to night 5 of The Eras Tour in Toronto last week.  From start to finish, the event was first class.  Very well organized entry, and everything felt very safe.  The concert itself was amazing!  I'm not the target demographic for TS, however I had a great time watching my young daughter have the time of her life along with tens of thousands of others.  The entire production was flawless and the atmosphere electric for the full duration of the show.  Incredible performer - she deserves everything she gets!  My only complaint was the merch lines and the costing on the concessions.  To be expected I guess, but at an over 800% markup, it becomes a bit much.  The overall cost for attending live events has become unattainable for many.  I feel very fortunate that we could afford it.  Overall - an incredible show and I look forward to her next big tour.

Standing sections like the balconies could have used stage boxes so people could see above the people that were glued to the railing.

"From the moment the lights dimmed and Taylor appeared on stage, I knew this wasn’t just a concert—it was a journey through the soundtrack of my life. The Eras Tour was everything I hoped for and so much more.

Hearing “State of Grace” as one of the surprise songs was like stepping back in time to a moment of pure nostalgia and hope. Her voice carried me through waves of emotion, and I couldn’t help but cry, feeling the weight of her lyrics all over again. When she sang “Labyrinth,” it felt as though time stopped. The vulnerability and beauty in that performance left me completely undone.

Throughout the night, I laughed, I cried, and I sang my heart out. Taylor’s ability to connect with an entire stadium full of people is nothing short of magical. Her storytelling, the visuals, the energy—it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will treasure forever.

If you ever have the chance to see her live, do it. This wasn’t just a concert; it was a celebration of artistry, resilience, and the power of music to bring us together. Thank you, Taylor, for giving us a night we’ll carry with us always.",Emotional Connection

However the system to acquire the tickets was a hassle and that hassle has transferred to every ticketmaster show I’ve attended.

Its taking away the ability for the everyday fan to attend and enjoy their favorite artists, and reflects on the selfishness and greed of Ticketmaster and the artists that allow this to happen.",Ticketing Issues

Resellers were buying hot items and selling for 2-3 times the price causing the venue to run out of hot items within 10 min of opening, while true fans had waited in lines for hours.

"I understand the hype! From the moment she took the stage to her last song of the night, Taylor was on point. The energy of the crowd, the lights and the effects, created an experience that's hard to even put into words. My daughter and I loved every minute",Atmosphere and Vibe
"What an amazing show! I'd watch it every night if I could. I just wish that it's easier for fans to access the tickets. However, all the effort was worth it. I've never been that happy in my life and I've never screamed that much! What a magical, sparkly, and enchanting night!",Ticketing Issues
This was by far the best concert I have been to in a long time!  I took my 9 yr old son for his birthday and he said that was the best moment in his life!  Thank you Taylor for giving us the best memories!,Emotional Connection
The concert as absolutely amazing and once I was finally able to grab a pair of tickets from ticket master the tickets were easy to use with no problems. The concert its self was the best show I have ever seen in my life. I do wish ticket master would alter their purchasing practices to further reduce the resold tickets at gross costs. It’s a shame when fan tickets end up in the hands of people just wanting to make money…treat tickets like plane tickets with names and id,Ticketing Issues
"It was one of the best night of my life. Her performance, the energy and effort put into was out of this world. I have always been a fan of taylor swift since I was eight, and I am grateful for ticketmaster or whoever selected me to get a presale tickets just to see her along with my younger sibling. Thank you so much!",Fan Community
"We really LOVED the concert and Taylor!  The whole thing was incredible.  Everything was so expensive though- 2 tickets $340, 2 meals(chicken tenders and tater tots) $78, 1 sweatshirt and 1 t-shirt $192!  Crazy expensive for one night!",Ticketing Issues
I’ve been a die hard swiftie for as long as I can remember. The Eras Tour is a class act. Taylor knows how to keep an audience engaged for 3.5 hours. The songs are just so nostalgic and meaningful. She sang with purpose and intent the whole night. One of the best nights of my life but hands down the best concert I have ever been to. I will forever be a fan of Taylor Alison Swift.,Emotional Connection
"Taylor is absolutely amazing !!!

TICKETMASTER should not let tickets be resold!   Not fair.  All that got a code should have been able to purchase tickets- why give so many codes ?!  And EVERYONE should have been able to get into the queue during the two weeks of the shows  


Merch - well not ticket master issue but again- LIMIT what one can buy!!",Ticketing Issues
"Epic show, merch lines were completely ridiculous and you were left with nothing but not sure how to avoid that. Food and drink prices way too high, $10 for a bottle of water, that’s robbery, can’t even afford to stay hydrated.",Ticketing Issues
"The Eras Tour is the BEST concert of all time. Taylor has set the bar high and I don't think anybody can do what she does. I became a fan because of my husband, and I totally get it now how crazy swifties are over her. You get the best value for your buck for this concert. This was my 4th show and the last. I hope she doesn't wait too long to have another concert.",Fan Community
"Show was marvelous! You certainly get your moneys worth. 3 hr 45 minutes.
Artistry and lighting was wonderful! Made the show all that much better. 10/10 experience. Venue wasn't great. Way too crowded which made it very uncomfortable. Seats were way too small. Halls selling merchandise and drinks/food was overrun with people. Long, long line to use the facilities. Should have been held at larger venue.",Long Show Duration

To say I got to be at an Eras Tour show will be one of my greatest memories to share. Experiencing this with my daughter is something we will both cherish forever. Taylor you are AMAZING!,Emotional Connection
Best concert. Didn’t even feel like 3.5hrs. She is amazing. You’d think she could go on for 6hrs the energy she has. So captivating.,Long Show Duration

"This was an amazing show, the performance was amazing, the environment was great and we really enjoyed!",Atmosphere and Vibe
"The Eras tour in Toronto was world class. The communication on which gate we were to go to, what corner of the stadium the gate was located at, how to scan your ticket was excellent. The police presence to handle the crowds and block roads made it very efficient to navigate our way to the event from public transport. The concert of course… was amazing!!!! Well done Toronto!",Overall Organization

"Attending Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour was nothing short of magical! From start to finish, the entire experience was perfectly orchestrated. Ticketmaster made the process seamless, and the anticipation leading up to the event only added to the excitement.

Taylor’s performance was absolutely phenomenal. Her stage presence, vocals, and the stunning visuals made every moment unforgettable. Each era came to life with its own unique charm, taking us on a nostalgic journey through her musical evolution. The energy in the crowd was electric, and you could feel the love and connection Taylor shares with her fans.

The venue was well-organized, with clear signage and helpful staff. Entry was smooth, and the sound quality was impeccable throughout the night. I especially appreciated how Ticketmaster kept us updated on event details leading up to the show, which made planning so much easier.

This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m so grateful to Ticketmaster for helping make it happen. Thank you for bringing us closer to an artist who means so much to so many. I’ll cherish this night forever!",Emotional Connection

This was more than just a concert it was a full Taylor Swift experience. It was the best and most magical day of my entire life and I feel so lucky to have been able to go. I will hold onto the memories from this day for the rest of my life. Seeing my favourite singer and role model who I have been a fan of since I was 5 singing picture to burn was a full circle moment and nothing will ever compare. It was a bonding experience with my three sisters that I will cherish forever. Thank you Taylor for everything 🫶🏻,Emotional Connection

I saw Morgan wallen at Lucas oil and the music quality was eh. I was nervous for Taylor bc I read online that the acoustics weren’t great to performers in there - but Taylor was amazing!! I was in the nose bleeds and still had an amazing experience. The show started on time and it was so amazing and worth the money! Best concert ever!,Overall Organization
"First of all, this was my first concert experience outside my home country. And Ive to say it was a delightful experience which was not due to Taylor but the love and charm spread by swifties. I am not a Else, musicwise the listening experience wasn’t the same as what you listen on her videos or spotify. Her voice was kinda male dominated at times but the background singers and dancers makes it all at a different level. My seat was on ground floor, so couldn’t see the stage and bridge light effects, but it was worth it since I could see Taylor from nearby. No matter where you sit, you’ll always be able to see the screen . Having said that, I am not a huge swiftie who knows all of her songs, so was not being able to get along in whole concert. Maybe that’s why i’ve given 4 stars. But definitely was a mind blowing experience! Management of event was good, staff was welcoming.Security measures could be improved.",Fan Community

"I was ready for it. It's been a long time coming! I counted days, I counted miles, to see her there. It was rare I was there I remember it all too well. I don't know how it gets better than this! This night was sparkling and flawless! Taylor was the loudest woman this city had ever see, and the crowds went wild! This happens once every few lifetimes so in this moment now, capture it, remember it, hold on to the memories they will hold on to you. Confetti falls to the ground may these memories break our fall, there's glitter on the floor after the party, I had the time of my life with Taylor and Gracie!",Atmosphere and Vibe

At 68, I have never experienced a concert as inspirational as this one in my lifetime & will never probably have an opportunity to do it again.  Thank you, Taylor…

Taylor, was the opening act at a Brad Paisley, concert I attended many years ago.  I still remember her performance, a tiny girl in large cowboy boots singing her Tim McGrath, song.  Taylor, stole my heart that evening.

In honesty I did not closely follow Taylor’s music when she switched to pop as it targeted a younger audience, but I would continue to listen to Taylor’s music by chance & follow TV award shows.  I thought what an amazing young woman, a smart business woman, thriving in a challenging world; & thinking how proud her parents must feel to have raised such an incredible person.

Unfortunately Taylor’s life appeared to be an open book & she grew up with all eyes on her so it is obvious her success did not come without heartache and pain along the way… way to go Taylor, for just being yourself through it all, may you enjoy much happiness in your future!  

You have acquired an “older” new fan who will pay closer attention as you continue to follow your heart and dreams wherever they take you.  

For myself Taylor’s concert was an experience  
to make memories with my grandsons.   A once in a lifetime experience to make lifetime memories. Life can be unfair at times, and everyone has a story, this story will bring good memories that can be shared for generations to come.

They will remember the impact this eras tour of Taylor’s had not just on our lives but the lives of so many.
 
My first travel post COVID and it was amazing to truly feel like I stepped out from my bubble back home.  An  opportunity to escape life’s woes for a brief time, turn off all external noise and focus on some positive in life.  If only for a short time a door was unlocked and shared with loved ones.  Again, thank you “Taylor”

After standing for hours outside the CN Tower and Rogers Stadium in Toronto for two days I gained much knowledge & insight.  The atmosphere was filled with happiness, love and much excitement from all walks of life.    One big family reunion enjoyed by all.  Fans were singing their hearts out without missing a beat, word for word as if it were gospel.

They came from far and wide, all shapes and sizes, different nationalities, religions & cultures all with a magical connection to Taylor Swift.

They liked what they liked, and they clearly expressed all of Taylor’s music & life in their appearance.  Fans “Swifties” were dressed to demonstrate the various albums/eras of her life.  The thought, time and care fans placed on replicating Taylor’s style was really something to witness.  There was “sparkle” and “glitter” everywhere young and old alike, even many fan pets came outfitted in Taylor fashion!

The friendship bracelet frenzy, friends trading and sharing bracelets at every opportunity and exchanging stories.  

For an old gal I learned so much on this experience.  I found myself imagining what kind of world we could live in if only we could spread this Taylor phenomenon like a virus?  WOW just WOW!

CONS 
None.  Observations…
The safety & security in & around Toronto & at the venue was clearly evident and much appreciated.

Entry into the stadium, was efficient and swift but once inside much confusion existed among staff.  In particular crowd direction and lines for merchandise sadly lacked.  Fans were repeatedly redirected causing some frustration to fans.  It was obvious the demand exceeded expectations and after hours of waiting in line, one was hard pressed to find availability of selection and size.  This apparently was the same with pre sale of merchandise; surely this is something that needs revision and consideration for future events similar in nature. 

This held true for all food and washroom access which for the most part fans were prepared for these challenges and happily accepted any inconvenience.

All & all most fans & workers alike remained respectful based solely on my observations.

My Ticketmaster experience was a first & although uncomfortable with such online transactions it went well.  Unfortunately that was not the case for many concert goers seeking tickets for this event.  That leaves something to be said for online ticket acquisition for events at major venues.  Corporate ticket options serve a purpose but do not reach the broader fan base in most instances.  Although not cost effective these days there is something to be said for a portion of ticket supply available for purchase at venues. 

Floor seating/standing does not accommodate a shorter audience.  Safety built flooring on an elevation could easily resolve oversight otherwise floor tickets should indicate view obstruction as applicable to other venue seating when view obstruction is a possibility.",Emotional Connection

Fans were repeatedly redirected causing some frustration to fans.  It was obvious the demand exceeded expectations and after hours of waiting in line, one was hard pressed to find availability of selection and size.  This apparently was the same with pre sale of merchandise; surely this is something that needs revision and consideration for future events similar in nature. 

This held true for all food and washroom access which for the most part fans were prepared for these challenges and happily accepted any inconvenience.

All & all most fans & workers alike remained respectful based solely on my observations.

My Ticketmaster experience was a first & although uncomfortable with such online transactions it went well.  Unfortunately that was not the case for many concert goers seeking tickets for this event.  That leaves something to be said for online ticket acquisition for events at major venues.  Corporate ticket options serve a purpose but do not reach the broader fan base in most instances.  Although not cost effective these days there is something to be said for a portion of ticket supply available for purchase at venues. 

Floor seating/standing does not accommodate a shorter audience.  Safety built flooring on an elevation could easily resolve oversight otherwise floor tickets should indicate view obstruction as applicable to other venue seating when view obstruction is a possibility.",Overall Organization
"I took my daughter to the concert and I'm more of a country music fan but TS is a real entertainer! She was engaging to the crowd. She covered a wide variety of music. The concert was over 3 hours long, not including the warm up act. The last time I was in an environment with fans that loud was at a play off game. They sold out of the blue crew neck so go early if you want that. Overall a great concert, it might ruin other concerts for me in the future.",Long Show Duration

"Taylor  Swift is a rock star!  3+ hours of non-stop entertainment.  I don't know how she does it.  The venue was great - we were happy with our 500 level seats purchased directly. We are so happy we didn't have to buy  re-sale tickets. The food of course was a little pricey but everything about the night went smoothly regarding entry, line-ups and finding our way around. We also got a pre-paid parking spot which was so convenient. We loved the way the audience was engaged for the night with what they wore and the bracelet trading. It was a great overall experience.  Taylor put on an amazing show. We are just hoping TS doesn't change her family friendly style - some of her more recent work is getting questionable.  We thoroughly enjoyed Gracie Adams as well - and loved that they sang together.",Overall Organization

"I could never say enough good things about this tour. It was everything my daughter and I could have dreamed of. The fight to get tickets was horrendous, but the venue itself was amazing. The security team was phenomenal, everyone we interacted with was so kind, and the merch stands were set up very well considering how busy they were. It was easy to get to our seats and find the nearest restroom. I loved that because of the demographic, men’s restrooms were converted to women’s as well, I never had to wait in line more than a few minutes. And the concert itself was the absolute best concert I’ve ever been to hands-down, the production is insane.",Ticketing Issues

Taylor Swift was breathtakingly gorgeous, the stage, the set, production and lighting were unbelievable.  Just when I thought it couldn’t get any better, it did and kept going!🩷🩵💜  
N3 in TO had us on our feet for hours dancing, singing and in total awe.  We celebrated Gracie’s Grammy nom. and our surprise acoustic set brought me back to my last TO Reputation Tour with Out of the Woods!💚🐍🖤 
I feel so fortunate to have been given a ticket code over a year ago and will forever remember my Eras Tour experience. Thank you Taylor Swift and everyone who made the show possible, to the Rogers Centre crew for a smooth running event, and to Ticketmaster for access to the tickets.
Forever grateful,

"Taylor puts on a hell of a show. Just be prepared to pay. Got tickets from tickets master. Expensive but i suppose the #1 selling artist on earth is going to be. Merch was expensive and drinks/snacks at the venue were brutal expensive. 

Shows are becoming out of reach for most people. As a Swifty dad I don't understand how most people can afford prices like this. 

But again she puts out a world class show and people throw money to see it, so good for her.",Ticketing Issues

"I would have given this show 5/5 because Taylor was awesome. But we had obstructed tickets thanks to 1 of the 4 large light/sound/pyrotechnic towers built around the stage. Every time Taylor went to the middle portion of the stage, which raised and lowered, (which was a lot) my wife and I couldn’t see at all. This especially sucks considering the price of the “VIP” tickets.",Ticketing Issues

But I do feel that the hype of everyone going absolutely crazy with Merch and lining up for 7hours is crazy to me.  I feel having a  3 1/2 hours concert was way too long of a show. It would’ve been much better if it stopped around 2 1/2 to 3 hours. I would definitely recommend someone going to see the show but not for thousands of dollars.",Long Show Duration

"The show itself was beyond amazing. Taylor put on an energetic performance with beautiful visuals for 3.5 hours, an absolute 5/5! My ticket however, did not say limited or obstructed view and there was a definite obstruction. The large speaker was directly in the sightline of her diamond stage where she spends most of her time. I was quite disappointed that I was not aware prior to purchasing that this would be the case. Although I could watch much of the show on the screen, I could not see Taylor on the diamond stage. Fan services said there was nothing they could do. I would not have been as sad, if I had at least been prepared for the poor view which definitely impacted the full enjoyment of the show. I would otherwise have given this experience a higher rating.",Long Show Duration

"I highly recommend anyone who can see TS live! As my husband will attest, the movie and live streams do not do the show, her energy or the production justice. Be careful with seats though. We had a straight on view 200 level but the 13th row had a huge overhang at Rogers Centre. It cut off part of the view and was distracting until about halfway through when we got so absorbed by her talent. Also felt terrible because I had to ask the young (20 something) not to scream sing. She was literally just screaming every word. But she was so full of energy and love for TS I felt bad but having overpaid for seats it was disruptive. I saw TS in Stockholm N1 and N2 and the loud singing is usually a positive and everyone together drowns out a single voice (but wasn’t case in Toronto N2).  My husband did not want to go having heard the terrible singing in the livestreams but it was not an issue when we weren’t against a wall and were instead immersed in the crowd. All this is a long way to say it is worth it but consider seats carefully and research the venue if you can!!!",Atmosphere and Vibe

I feel that my daughter will be ruined for future concerts if she is expecting the headliner to be on stage for 3.5 hours.   Everything about the concert itself was great (crowd, lights, sound, performers, etc). 

My complaints have to do with merchandise and food.  The lines were long and wait was horrendous.  We waited an hour in one of the merch lines.  I ordered and paid for a pizza and then had to wait 10 minutes for it to be ready.  Those two things combined caused me to miss the opening act.  

All things considered I did enjoy myself and would recommend for everyone to see this show regardless of fandom.",Long Show Duration
