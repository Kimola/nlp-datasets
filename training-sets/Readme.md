# Training Sets
**Kimola** has repositories with training sets for the models you will create, or you can use them in your own projects. This repository contains datasets consisting of comments from Back To The Future viewers, Taylor Swift fans, and Disneyland theme park visitors. We tried to make these datasets as unique as possible for you. I know you are here, moviegoers, Taylor Swift fans, and adrenaline junkies! Yes, yes, we know that we can no longer tolerate anything that makes us bored or depressed, even if it is a training set! So we wanted to add some fun to the training sets.
## Back To The Future Movie Set
Before downloading and using the training sets, let's take a deep breath and first lower the Delorean onto our heads at 80 mph. Because using a training set requires calmness, let's not forget that. Dear Back to the Future fans, we have prepared this training set for you. We took the viewer comments from imdb for Back to the Future I and assigned labels to the comments. As a result, in the Back to the Future I set, the first column is the comments and the second column is the labels. If you are a Back to the Future viewer, you will love this set. You may want to watch Back to the Future before finishing the sets, so be careful!

You can download the Back To The Future training set [here](https://github.com/Kimola/nlp-datasets/blob/main/training-sets/Back%20to%20The%20Future%20(Movie)%20-%20Training%20Set.csv)

## Disneyland Theme Park Set
Let's see the hands, people! Fast trains, flying balloons and more. This training set we have prepared for adrenaline lovers will push you to visit Disneyland theme parks. We took visitor reviews for Disneyland Theme Park from Tripadvisor and Google and assigned labels to each review. As a result, the Disneyland Theme Park set has column 1 of reviews and column 2 of labels.

## Taylor Swift Concert Set
Are you an addict or are you someone who can only listen to Taylor Swift in peace? Get your headphones ready and turn up the volume Taylor Swift, please! We took reviews of Taylor Swift concerts on the Ticketmaster platform and assigned tags to each of the reviews. As a result, we created a set of reviews for Taylor Swift concerts, with the first column consisting of comments and the second column consisting of tags. When you start using this set, Taylor Swift will start playing in the background. It was like a prophecy, right? Just kidding...
