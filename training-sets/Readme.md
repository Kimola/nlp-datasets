# Training Sets
**Kimola** has repositories that contain training sets for the models you will create or you can use them in your own projects. This repository contains datasets consisting of comments from Back To The Future viewers, Taylor Swift fans and Disneyland theme park visitors. We tried to make these datasets as unique as possible for you. I know you are here, movie lovers, Taylor Swift fans and adrenaline junkies!
## Back To The Future Movie Set
We took the audience reviews for Back to the Future I from imdb and assigned tags to the reviews. As a result, on the set of Back to the Future I, the first column is the reviews and the second column is the tags. If you're a Back to the Future watcher, you'll love this set. You might want to watch Back to the Future before you finish working on the sets, so be careful!
## Disneyland Theme Park Set
We took visitor reviews for Disneyland Theme Park from Tripadvisor and Google and assigned labels to each review. As a result, the Disneyland Theme Park set has column 1 of reviews and column 2 of labels.
## Taylor Swift Concert Set
We took reviews of Taylor Swift concerts on the Ticketmaster platform and assigned tags to each of the reviews. As a result, we created a set of reviews for Taylor Swift concerts, with the first column consisting of comments and the second column consisting of tags. When you start using this set, Taylor Swift will start playing in the background. It was like a prophecy, right? Just kidding...
