I really can‚Äôt wait for my next time!,Magic Atmosphere

"This was a very magical experience. Everything was at a high standard including service and interior. We stayed in a deluxe room which also included the d lounge for breakfast and afternoon tea. I wasn't sure what to expect for afternoon tea, however, it included miniature savories as well as dessert and treats including your drinks. So instead of lunch we would often come back to the hotel and have afternoon tea. The staff couldn't do enough for you. I wish we could have stayed longer, however, we are planning on returning again this year. We drove here so parking was nice and easy and very safe.",Magic Atmosphere

"I am going to write this review before visiting and will write another after we have been.  This review is based on the website and information gathering.  I think the website is shockingly bad.  To be able to gather simple information like location of rides, where to meet Mickey and simple information.  Terrible.  I have called 3 times to book into the Disneyland Hotel and each time the call did not deliver what I wanted.  First time the call handler was very off hand and did not explain all aspects, the second call I booked but did not get an email confirming the booking, the third call, I tried to book the Royal Banquet and it was not booked.  Really poor experience before arriving.  I so hope it improves when we get there.",Customer Service

"I haven‚Äôt even been to Disneyland Paris yet however I want to comment on how poor Disney‚Äôs customer service is. I have booked a trip to the Davy Crockett ranch for may. After booking this I decided to add on character dining for breakfast. When I was making this booking the website had a glitch at the payment stage. I checked my emails to check if the payment went through and there was no confirmation email. So I tried to book it again and it was successful with confirmation straight away.Then I discovered Disney has charged me twice for the booking. However on the emails and account only shows 1 booking. I have been disputed this ever this. Almost 3 weeks and no resolution. I am ¬£206.26 out of pocket which might not seem much for a billion pound company but for me it is. Every time I call or email they just fob me off saying it‚Äôs with the accounts department. I am shocked by the lack of efficiency or urgency from Disney. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm getting my money back and making me second guess the holiday. Did not expect this, I thought it would be a first class service. If this happens to anyone else good luck.",Customer Service
"I love Disney and brought my kids up with beauty and the beast, Bambi and Mickey Mouse. Sadly I think I went there 20years too late and I didn‚Äôt get the whole magic thing. What‚Äôs the magic in queuing for hours for a 2 minute ride, standing in the cold for 30 minutes to meet a character and spending around 12/13 hours out each day with no real provision to relax. We spent a small fortune on food and hot drinks. The whole park runs like clockwork but it‚Äôs just so busy. Apparently according to the data we chose the quietest week to go ?? Really, it was packed everywhere so I dread what it‚Äôs like in peak season. I‚Äôll keep watching the films but sadly I won‚Äôt be returning to the park",Magic Atmosphere

"I spent three unforgettable days at Disneyland Paris with my son, and it was truly magical! We met every character, took tons of pictures, and collected signatures‚Äîit was a dream come true for him.One of the highlights was having breakfast with the characters, which was so much fun, and the buffet was really good. Lunch at the Royal Banquet was also a great experience, with delicious food in a beautiful setting.The park itself is massive, and even after three days, there were still rides and attractions we didn‚Äôt have time for. Every moment was exciting, and the attention to detail in every corner of the park was incredible.The only downside was the long lines and waiting times, but overall, it was an amazing experience that we‚Äôll never forget. Highly recommend for families!",Magic Atmosphere

Terrible customer service - payment taken 3 times by Disney which left us penniless with our two young children and still  not refunded  12 days later! Family of four split up for Princess breakfast which paid extra for! We had to return home as no money - at resort we were  told there was nothing they could do we had to email but we were unlikely to get a  response for at least 48 hrs. We received an automated email and are still waiting for our overpayment to be refunded 12 days later! Shane on you Disney!,Customer Service

I had planned our visit extensively for our visit on 23 December and thought I was ready.  We had purchased return transfers from Gare du Nord but on the day at the designated pick up spot  we were met by a Disney rep and had to walk 500 metres to another location to meet the bus.  Sense of arrival was great and we loved  the Christmas tree and decorations.  Wait times were crazy even early in the day. One of the highlights was the queen of hearts maze.  We spent 90 minutes queuing for its a small world and then discovered you could buy individual fast passes for as cheap as 9 euros per person.  We did this for most major rides to save hours in the queues.  This could have been better promoted.  Crowds were next level.  We loved being able to buy champagne in Disney glasses at top of Main Street but surprised they only took cash.  Overall the kids enjoyed their visit.  Pirates of the Caribbean was popular. Poor signage getting back to our bus meant we missed it and had to get a BOLT,Planning Tips

I just don‚Äôt know why - but for me there is no doubt that this has to be the 2 worst Disney parks there are. The park is one of the most beautiful ones - Details in every corner - lovely theming and classic attractions. BUT - the Disneyland park has not seen anything new within the last 30 years. Not a single attraction is state of the art.The wait times are beginning to get outrageous .. even during off season. Why ? Poor operations and questionable ride opening hours. As hotel guest you get early entry- unfortunately not a lot of attractions are available at that time - meaning that you wait just as much as you do if you don‚Äôt show up early. The same for closing - why do most attractions close at 17 ? Why - just to boost wait times for no reason. Once the parade is over with small kids - you just have to sit there and wait for the firework to finally happen. And what is the deal with pins and the guest service building ? Why take out the few things that are free and fun - but don‚Äôt cost anything‚Ä¶ not really magical. Why make a big fuzz about not being able to enter that building - same here artificial created wait times- inside the building are more staff members than 3 attractions combined ‚Ä¶ not sure what they are actually doing there.,Ride Experience

"Bought a 2-park 3-day pass for Paris Disney and it was the first thing we did on a 6 week family adventure so expectations were high. Mid December and the park was decorated beautifully for Christmas, with lights, trees and fake snow down Main Street throughout the day. A few rides at both parks were under redevelopment which was a bit disappointing but we still had plenty to do. We're not big on thrill rides but did do Crush's coaster and Thunder Mountain which were lots of fun for these 2 teens and 50-somethings. The classics such as It's a Small World and Pirates of the Caribbean were great and the Ratatouille ride was fantastic (although not good for vertigo!). Food was average and overpriced, ride queues averaged 30 minutes (we did wait 50 for Crush's coaster), we could have paid for a fast pass but hubby was not keen given how much we'd already spent on entry tickets. The stage shows were next level and production values are high throughout the parks. My nearly 18 year old got to live her disney princess fantasies and the 14 year old boy was impressed with it all. The evening drone show is particularly good.Thankfully we bumped into a fellow Aussie who gave us some helpful advice about meals. So after wandering around aimlessly on day 1 we used the Disney app to its full advantage for days 2 and 3. On day 2 we booked lunch at the PYM kitchen all you can eat buffet. Even if booked out it's worth refreshing and keep trying because people do cancel. The food here was actually very good. On day 3 we prepaid for burgers at cafe Hyperion and skipped the main queue to go to click and collect, Well worth doing.Beware - there is a disney tax in everything and you WILL spend lots of money on merch! LOLOnce in a lifetime Disney trip! Despite the cost, will do it again.",Family Experience

Food was average and overpriced, ride queues averaged 30 minutes (we did wait 50 for Crush's coaster), we could have paid for a fast pass but hubby was not keen given how much we'd already spent on entry tickets. The stage shows were next level and production values are high throughout the parks. My nearly 18 year old got to live her disney princess fantasies and the 14 year old boy was impressed with it all. The evening drone show is particularly good.Thankfully we bumped into a fellow Aussie who gave us some helpful advice about meals. So after wandering around aimlessly on day 1 we used the Disney app to its full advantage for days 2 and 3. On day 2 we booked lunch at the PYM kitchen all you can eat buffet. Even if booked out it's worth refreshing and keep trying because people do cancel. The food here was actually very good. On day 3 we prepaid for burgers at cafe Hyperion and skipped the main queue to go to click and collect, Well worth doing.Beware - there is a disney tax in everything and you WILL spend lots of money on merch! LOLOnce in a lifetime Disney trip! Despite the cost, will do it again.",Planning Tips
"Bought a 2-park 3-day pass for Paris Disney and it was the first thing we did on a 6 week family adventure so expectations were high. Mid December and the park was decorated beautifully for Christmas, with lights, trees and fake snow down Main Street throughout the day. A few rides at both parks were under redevelopment which was a bit disappointing but we still had plenty to do.

"I am a young woman who was physically assaulted by a man my father‚Äôs age in Disneyland Paris in August 2024.I have been going to Disneyland Paris for years and many times but that was the last time I would step foot in there after how badly they dealt with this.I have emailed and showed pictures from the assault and it is all documented in guest relations and with the security there and the email I received back from them they may as well of said ‚Äúwho cares, not our problem‚Äù.The incident took place in August 2024 in the line for Mickey and the magician. I was with my two sisters and we were all lining up. A man grabs me by my arm in the line and tugs me backward to get in front of me. This left a huge bruise on my arm with indents of his fingers from the force. I began shouting please don‚Äôt touch me and he laughed and said I didn‚Äôt. His wife then got in my face and threatened me, and his son was yelling that his father didn‚Äôt. I was roaring crying and when we went inside I went and said it to the cast member. While I was telling the cast member the son came over and interrupted and said his father didn‚Äôt touch me. I asked the cast member for the security footage so I could show them exactly what I was talking about and I was disgusted that there is no video footage in the lines (which is absolutely shocking!).I told the cast member it was assault and I was visibly upset. She told me she would get someone after the show to come over and talk to us. Looking back now what horrific way of dealing with this. They let a man who assaulted a girl sit down and enjoy the show while I can‚Äôt breathe or enjoy the show as I had a panic attack.After the show we waited (myself and my sisters) and went to the girl and were told the family left (of course they did they ran as soon as possible) and the security were outside looking for him. Security were nice and took it seriously however why would this be allowed ? We allow people who assault others to sit and enjoy the show? So Disney only care about its money and not the safety. I went further and made the report to guest relations where o was given a fast pass for the show.Like seriously? A fast pass for a show I have trauma for now and could never line up on that. I suffer with anxiety and the distress this entire situation was for me to this day is upsetting. I didn‚Äôt go back to the park the next day out of fear. I have been having therapy for 5 months now on how to deal with queues and lines and get over the assault. I will try attach the picture and show you how bad my arm was left and how Disney allowed a violent man to watch a show and roam around the park not caring the distress caused to others.Disney you should be ashamed. I have told everyone high and low and warned people not to go. Before I told people I allowed a saving grace of their email to redeem how wrong they were. The reply as mentioned earlier basically said not their problem and I can try attach the picture of this too. Ruby from guest relations who responded did not care in the slightest. You wouldn‚Äôt get this treatment in Disney world where they bend over backwards to protect and help guests. Disgusted.Watch out for your safety if you go. They didn‚Äôt for me.",Customer Service

"Unfortunately due to the red warning storm we had in Scotland last Friday, our trip was cancelled by the airline. @disneylandparis refused on the Friday to move the date, or refund for the 2 day tickets for the Saturday.Incredibly poor for a childrens theme park, never mind with one with such a wonderful reputation. We rebooked the trip at great expense to visit again this weekend, but it seems we have to purchase 2 days tickets once again. I provided proof of our trip cancellation, but they were unwilling to assist. Incredibly surprised and disappointed by this decision, as is my 4 year old.",Ticket Pricing

"This was our very first time visiting Paris and Disneyland Paris. We just couldn't get enough of the whole experience. It was the highlight of our whole trip. All of us adults and kids are still dreaming of the whole experience. The staff was amazing and super helpful. Walt Disney Studios Avengers Campus with the theme song playing gave us goosebumps every single time as we are hardcore Marvel fans. The character performances were fabulous. If only we could get a prior notification when each character comes out on the street or the roof would have been fantastic. I couldn't beleive my eyes when I saw my favourite character Loki. I missed the show as I didn't know when it was happening. It was a minor hiccup compared to the whole next level experience with superb rides, the Disney stars on parade. The younger kids loved meeting Mickey and Princesses. The Avengers Flight force ride was out of this world. Since we had only 1 day to cover most activities we missed out on most. It was surprising it was still really crowded during winter but queues moved fairly quick. Unexpected meet with Captain Jack Sparrow was epic. He was so kind to stop and take a pic with me. Web Slinger, Ratatouille, Phantom Manor, Small World are few main rides we did. The other family went in all the kids rides on Disneyland Park. The lights how at 8pm was so magical and standing outside in the freezing cold was totally worth it. The restaurants werenot too crowded but we grabbed bites from trucks as we wanted to do more activities. Wish we had more time to do more rides as 1 day is definitely not enough for the 2 parks. Will need atleast 3 days. Next time we will definitely choose   to stay at a Disney Hotel so we can enjoy extra magic time before the general crowd. Using the Disneyland Paris app was also super easy. Will definitely give this wholesome family fun experience a 10 out of 10.",Family Experience

"Always have a magical time at Disneyland Paris, where the staff, the shows, the night illuminations really help with the magic. The new show really was good with the projections in the main street, which we already had experience in Disneyland California but this was so nostalgic and right into the heart, so a top feeling just before you leave the main park. Staff was great, food was good and snacks as well. Stayed at Sequoia for the 1st night, got a really nice room and had a really good experience at check in with Nuno Lui, who made sure to let us know the luggage could be transferred to Disneyland Hotel in the morning, which meant we got straight into the parks in the following day. I didn't know this so the fact that he paid attention to what I told him was gonna be our plan and tailored for us, was TOP. We had our bags in our room around 6pm, which was before dinner, so were able to get ready for our Manhattan experience with 0 fuss. Once in Manhattan, we had a great experience, where Nicolas took very good care of us, food was great and he made sure the dishes my wife picked didn't contain tomato, as she is allergic. We had a great experience at the Royal Banquet, or so we thought, but sadly, my wife got sick in the middle of the night. I know this is a buffet but I still feel once I told the staff she was allergic to tomato we should have been taken around the buffet to understand what she could eat, as she did her best to pick the dishes she thought didn't contain but this is a bit of a mission impossible, resulting in a really bad night before our last park day.We had a good experience at the Stark Industries and at the food carts we got around both parks for some nice snacking / small bites and also, at the Disney Village at the Steakhouse and Annette's.There are a few things to mention here that for me are the reason why this trip will never be a 5 start for me and my wife. I paid 85eur for a photopass for my 3 days and came home feeling like I paid 8.5eur per photo. There was 1 single magic spot in all our stay, never see photopass photographers anywhere, a lot of characters don't have this as well, so why are we being charged so much for it? The difference between Paris and the american parks is huge, I always come home with so many memories from the american parks photo wise and sadly with barely any from Paris. The price of premier access is insane, will have again to mention the genie in Disneyland California, which even includes photos!!!! and is so much cheaper than Paris. I'd definitely prefer to queue 5/10 minutes and have more people access it than feeling that you need to be rich to have access to these experiences. Also, there's still a lot of main rides not included with it, I think after paying so much this should really feel premier. Also, aware of the state of Walt Disney Studios right now with the re-theming and understanding with that but it does mean place gets too crowded in the few tunnels where we can pass to go from one side to the other of the park, and really not feeling a lot magical right now. We still enjoyed the attractions there and the pixar show is always a good experience. A bit disappointed with the night show, feeling like it's lacking and was a waste of our time.",Magic Atmosphere

The price of premier access is insane, will have again to mention the genie in Disneyland California, which even includes photos!!!! and is so much cheaper than Paris. I'd definitely prefer to queue 5/10 minutes and have more people access it than feeling that you need to be rich to have access to these experiences. Also, there's still a lot of main rides not included with it, I think after paying so much this should really feel premier. Also, aware of the state of Walt Disney Studios right now with the re-theming and understanding with that but it does mean place gets too crowded in the few tunnels where we can pass to go from one side to the other of the park, and really not feeling a lot magical right now. We still enjoyed the attractions there and the pixar show is always a good experience. A bit disappointed with the night show, feeling like it's lacking and was a waste of our time.",Overall Satisfaction
"Ok, Where to start‚Ä¶ so me and my husband booked a last minute trip to Disneyland Paris. The whole experience from start to finish have been awful. The buses running to and from the hotels to Disneyland are not regular you will be waiting atleast 45 minutes for the bus, by then lots of people are waiting already and you are crammed onto the bus like sardines.  If you have anxiety or are claustrophobic AVOID getting the bus. And when going from Disney to the hotel you have people shouting TAXI TAXI TO HOTEL GOOD PRICE every 5 seconds which was incredibly draining and not what you need after a long day out. Going into Disneyland everything is extremely lackluster.  There‚Äôs a lot of walking but not really much entertainment or things to see on the way. No where to sit down and relax.  Hardly any cast members around.  A lot of park works going on at the moment with boards up and stuff blocked off.  A lot of the rides were shut for refurbishment.  Me and my husband booked a table to plaza gardens and was left to wait outside in the rain before 30 minutes had passed so we just left.  The food prices are ridiculous.  In the whole of Disney. Nothing is run correctly and honestly Disney should be ashamed of themselves.  French people in general are incredibly rude.  They push past you ,barge into you and they do not apologise.  Honestly this has been the worst holiday I have ever been on and I have been a lot of places.   I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anybody to visit Disneyland Paris.  Go to Disney world Florida instead don‚Äôt waste your money here because you will regret it.  SPEND IT ELSEWHERE! If I could give this place 0 stars I would We also stayed at the grand magic hotel which was not a good experience but that‚Äôs for another review.",Crowd Management

I booked a one day park ticket for my little sister‚Äôs 21st Birthday and we were in re so excited to go. Unfortunately 3.5 days before we were supposed to go we were informed by our airline that there was a Status Red warning all flights would be either cancelled or delayed. We rescheduled our flights to 2 days later so we could still celebrate. I informed Disney immediately but because I was 6 hours outside the cancellation period there was nothing that could be done. For a company that is centred around family and celebration of we were shocked that they refused to even change the date by 2 days.I cannot believe that such a huge organisation whose focus is family fun would not even try to be accommodating in such unforeseen circumstances and has really left a negative impression with me and ruined a special birthday.,Ticket Pricing

"Been here six times as a family of 4 and can say the magic for us isnt there anymore. Disney really needs to sort out the que system!  So many people push in to catch up with their family instead of que together. Happened so many times the three days just barging past like you don't exsist, no excuse me or thank you. The last family had done this to us, 4 of them was in front of us then next minute at separate moments 7 of them barged past us, no manners, no excuse me just pushing past physically touching. We are not a argumentative couple but did end up having a confrontation with this spanish family and apparently we are 'british people' ...  For a family that have to que in all ques all day and not in special assistance it can be a long day especially in the cold with two small children and the constant rudeness and que pushing from certain people is ridiculous!!  So many selfish people around but they dont care as there is no enforcement.  Disney has also swapped the dream factory to a Minnies Musical moment, what a rubbish swap! Such a poor show especially if you have seen the dream factory!! It is a standing show and i wouldnt rush to que as we was near the front but once you go first room you are pushed back with everyone rushing in a small door pushing you. Buzz ride is still backing up and you feel like you stop so much.Spiderman broke the first time but fortunately the staff kindly let us go again.Characters are a bit limited. We went to see Minnie mouse and luckily got there when we did as they shut the que off. It was a long wait as special assistance line was also full.We have been to both disneyland paris and disneyworld Orlando many times and would recommend you save your money and visit Orlando!

So many people push in to catch up with their family instead of que together. Happened so many times the three days just barging past like you don't exsist, no excuse me or thank you. The last family had done this to us, 4 of them was in front of us then next minute at separate moments 7 of them barged past us, no manners, no excuse me just pushing past physically touching. We are not a argumentative couple but did end up having a confrontation with this spanish family and apparently we are 'british people' ...  For a family that have to que in all ques all day and not in special assistance it can be a long day especially in the cold with two small children and the constant rudeness and que pushing from certain people is ridiculous!!  So many selfish people around but they dont care as there is no enforcement.  Disney has also swapped the dream factory to a Minnies Musical moment, what a rubbish swap! Such a poor show especially if you have seen the dream factory!! It is a standing show and i wouldnt rush to que as we was near the front but once you go first room you are pushed back with everyone rushing in a small door pushing you. Buzz ride is still backing up and you feel like you stop so much.Spiderman broke the first time but fortunately the staff kindly let us go again.Characters are a bit limited. We went to see Minnie mouse and luckily got there when we did as they shut the que off. It was a long wait as special assistance line was also full.We have been to both disneyland paris and disneyworld Orlando many times and would recommend you save your money and visit Orlando!

"We went to Disneyland Paris on 18th January. We started in Disney studios and were let down that a lot of rides and attractions were closed for modernisation and renovation. Most of the Avengers campus was closed and Spiderman web ride was down due to technical issues. Also, the Disney characters were actively ignoring certain children, and not one cast member attempted to stop any queue jumping, in fact they condoned it by then pulling the children first who queue jumped! We moved over to Magic Kingdom which was a lot better managed, more fun, and generally better maintained. Other than the cold temperature i cannot fault Magic KingdomWe opted for Steak dinner in the Silver Spoon steakhouse which was delicious and we got a birthday cake for my son, the servers made sure to sing happy birthday too",Attraction Availability

"So our daughter wanted us to come to DLP with her and our young grandson, as we‚Äôve done Disney World around 30+ times we said ok. What an absolute waste of money, Disney Studios only us 50 percent open you can walk round it in 15 minutes, queued to get a photo with both Antman and Goofy but obviously queuing is not something the French understand as if kids where in a Disney costume the characters brought them to the front and other little ones were pushed to the back, blatantly rude why would people pay for this I do not know. Went over then to the Magic Kingdom, which was better but again so many things closed and so many restaurants not open. We also went to the Silver Spur steakhouse cost ‚Ç¨180, for a second rate meal although we did pay ‚Ç¨25 for a birthday which was very nice.Truthfully this trip has cost me ¬£2k, when honestly it‚Äôs not been worth ¬£1k.

"We visited Disneyland Paris for the 13th time for 2 days (arrived on December 9th and left early on December 11). We were also visiting with two priority cards on green.The Disneyland park never disappoints. In just over half a day we were able to do all the rides (except Pinocchio and Casey Junior as they were closed).The Christmas decorations throughout the park were great, especially down Main Street.Walt Disney Studios is a great park with many good rides. The rides are normally doable in around 3 and a half hours (if not a busy day) and with a priority card 2 and half hours. We love the park but sadly a lot of Walt Disney Studios is boarded up which was a shame but we did find out during the visit it is apparently because of the renaming of the park to Disney Adventure land.The food at both parks can be unpredictable; it can either be the best you've ever had or the worst. Unfortunately, the Disney parks are not very accommodating for people with coeliac disease (gluten free). At many fast-food restaurants in the park (like Bella Notte), our only options were salads/vegan food or microwave meals that resembled and tasted like baby food. At buffets you also only have a small option of foods.Most of the staff members are very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. However, there were a few staff members who weren't very friendly.For instance, while we were getting off Big Thunder Mountain, a family member accidentally dropped their phone onto the tracks. Although we knew it wasn‚Äôt a ideal situation, they could have been more understanding and friendly. They didn't keep us informed about what was happening. When we tried to explain the situation, they just shrugged, as if to say, ""What am I supposed to do?"" We stood there without any information for quite some time and got the impression that they were annoyed with us as they kept shaking their heads at us and rolling their eyes. It would have been helpful if a staff member had quickly/briefly explained what would happen next and didn't do those gestures towards us, especially since the person who dropped the phone was only struggling to get out because she is disabled. Despite the behavior of a few workers, the majority of the staff were very helpful.The priority card generally works well, but halfway through, we realized that the green color assigned to one of our family members was not correct, as she was having difficulty with the steps and getting in and out of the ride vehicles. We were unsure what to do with the card as it wasn't the correct colour. Having the green card meant we used both the premier queue and if there wasn't one we used the disabled queue. Most of the premier queues only skip half of the main queue and then merge into the normal queue. In our opinion, there should be a staff member present at every ride where the premier queue merges with the normal queue, as we faced challenges with this merging process. For example , on the Indiana Jones ride, no one wanted to let us into the queue. When we finally found a space to join, a group behind us started pointing and yelling that we had ""just pushed in,"" which attracted unwanted attention and made us feel uncomfortable. The merging experience often leads to awkwardness since people are reluctant to let you join the line. A staff member's presence would greatly alleviate this situation.Another issue we encountered was at the ride ""Le Pays des Contes de F√®es"" (the storybook boats next to Casey Jr.). The boarding area for disabled guests has a significant gap and step between the platform and the boat, making it very challenging for those with disabilities. Staff members had to physically help everyone out of the boat. In contrast, the area where guests in the normal queue board actually has a smaller gap. It would be ideal to add something like a removable platform to make exiting the boat easier. On our second attempt at riding the ride, we went through the normal queue, which meant there was a smaller step the boat as the gap wasn't as big but the actual queue stairs and the moving boat were then an issue.Queue jumping can be a significant issue in the parks, we noticed it more in the disabled queues. For instance, While we were in the disabled queue, a mother instructed her son to run past us and duck under the barriers to get ahead in line. She then pushed us aside while waving her disabled pass in our faces, insisting that her disability allowed her to go in front of us. We tried to explain that it was a queue for everyone with a disabled pass and that it's not acceptable to push ahead or send children under the barriers then catch up. Two staff members saw this happen but did not do anything, for a brief second it looked like one of the workers was going to say something but he then backed down. The workers continued to watch, and one of them eventually walked away. The worker then allowed that family on the ride before us, despite witnessing them send their under the barrier and push past us. We also had people try push in front of us on several other rides (The Parachutes, Crushes Coaster, The Story boats) . When We were waiting for the Toy Soldiers Parachute ride in the disabled queue a large family of over 25 members in front of us repeatedly rode in groups, and when each ride ended, the group would quickly run off the ride and past everyone in the disabled queue to rejoin their relatives. This meant we were in the queue for 40 minutes and if the queue didn‚Äôt move. Thankfully on the parachutes, Crushes Coaster and the boats the worker made sure whoever was queues up first could go on first. However, sadly some workers like the slinky dog worker choose not to do or say anything at all. The Christmas parade was amazing. It was wonderful to see the festive floats lit up in the dark and the characters in their Christmas outfits. We arrived an hour early to secure front-row views. It's definitely worth the wait.The fireworks were good. It was our first time watching them in over seven years, but we were a bit disappointed to see that not much had changed. However, if you haven't seen the fireworks before, you will likely enjoy them! The Notre-Dame de Paris show was nice to watch, and it was exciting to experience something new. The Notre-Dame show was only on for a few days, so we feel fortunate to have attended. Although the Notre-Dame show replaced the usual drone show, we would still love to see the drone show someday, as we have never had the chance to watch it before.The shops at Disneyland Paris are really pricey, but you kind of expect that at Disneyland. There's not a ton of variety in what they sell, and it feels like most of it is just Stitch-themed stuff, which kind of takes away from the overall selection.I would definitely recommend a visit for all ages. There are things to do for every age group. There are many rides for thrill seekers as well as numerous rides that are slow and gentle. Even if you don't like rides there is lots of things to do like meet & greets, watch shows and parades, walk round the labyrinth, castle and also loads of photo opportunities",Ride Experience

In just over half a day we were able to do all the rides (except Pinocchio and Casey Junior as they were closed).The Christmas decorations throughout the park were great, especially down Main Street.Walt Disney Studios is a great park with many good rides. The rides are normally doable in around 3 and a half hours (if not a busy day) and with a priority card 2 and half hours. We love the park but sadly a lot of Walt Disney Studios is boarded up which was a shame but we did find out during the visit it is apparently because of the renaming of the park to Disney Adventure land.The food at both parks can be unpredictable; it can either be the best you've ever had or the worst. Unfortunately, the Disney parks are not very accommodating for people with coeliac disease (gluten free). At many fast-food restaurants in the park (like Bella Notte), our only options were salads/vegan food or microwave meals that resembled and tasted like baby food. At buffets you also only have a small option of foods.Most of the staff members are very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. However, there were a few staff members who weren't very friendly.For instance, while we were getting off Big Thunder Mountain, a family member accidentally dropped their phone onto the tracks. Although we knew it wasn‚Äôt a ideal situation, they could have been more understanding and friendly. They didn't keep us informed about what was happening. When we tried to explain the situation, they just shrugged, as if to say, ""What am I supposed to do?"" We stood there without any information for quite some time and got the impression that they were annoyed with us as they kept shaking their heads at us and rolling their eyes. It would have been helpful if a staff member had quickly/briefly explained what would happen next and didn't do those gestures towards us, especially since the person who dropped the phone was only struggling to get out because she is disabled. Despite the behavior of a few workers, the majority of the staff were very helpful.The priority card generally works well, but halfway through, we realized that the green color assigned to one of our family members was not correct, as she was having difficulty with the steps and getting in and out of the ride vehicles. We were unsure what to do with the card as it wasn't the correct colour. Having the green card meant we used both the premier queue and if there wasn't one we used the disabled queue. Most of the premier queues only skip half of the main queue and then merge into the normal queue. In our opinion, there should be a staff member present at every ride where the premier queue merges with the normal queue, as we faced challenges with this merging process. For example , on the Indiana Jones ride, no one wanted to let us into the queue. When we finally found a space to join, a group behind us started pointing and yelling that we had ""just pushed in,"" which attracted unwanted attention and made us feel uncomfortable. The merging experience often leads to awkwardness since people are reluctant to let you join the line. A staff member's presence would greatly alleviate this situation.Another issue we encountered was at the ride ""Le Pays des Contes de F√®es"" (the storybook boats next to Casey Jr.). The boarding area for disabled guests has a significant gap and step between the platform and the boat, making it very challenging for those with disabilities. Staff members had to physically help everyone out of the boat. In contrast, the area where guests in the normal queue board actually has a smaller gap. It would be ideal to add something like a removable platform to make exiting the boat easier. On our second attempt at riding the ride, we went through the normal queue, which meant there was a smaller step the boat as the gap wasn't as big but the actual queue stairs and the moving boat were then an issue.Queue jumping can be a significant issue in the parks, we noticed it more in the disabled queues. For instance, While we were in the disabled queue, a mother instructed her son to run past us and duck under the barriers to get ahead in line. She then pushed us aside while waving her disabled pass in our faces, insisting that her disability allowed her to go in front of us. We tried to explain that it was a queue for everyone with a disabled pass and that it's not acceptable to push ahead or send children under the barriers then catch up. Two staff members saw this happen but did not do anything, for a brief second it looked like one of the workers was going to say something but he then backed down. The workers continued to watch, and one of them eventually walked away. The worker then allowed that family on the ride before us, despite witnessing them send their under the barrier and push past us. We also had people try push in front of us on several other rides (The Parachutes, Crushes Coaster, The Story boats) . When We were waiting for the Toy Soldiers Parachute ride in the disabled queue a large family of over 25 members in front of us repeatedly rode in groups, and when each ride ended, the group would quickly run off the ride and past everyone in the disabled queue to rejoin their relatives. This meant we were in the queue for 40 minutes and if the queue didn‚Äôt move. Thankfully on the parachutes, Crushes Coaster and the boats the worker made sure whoever was queues up first could go on first. However, sadly some workers like the slinky dog worker choose not to do or say anything at all. The Christmas parade was amazing. It was wonderful to see the festive floats lit up in the dark and the characters in their Christmas outfits. We arrived an hour early to secure front-row views. It's definitely worth the wait.The fireworks were good. It was our first time watching them in over seven years, but we were a bit disappointed to see that not much had changed. However, if you haven't seen the fireworks before, you will likely enjoy them! The Notre-Dame de Paris show was nice to watch, and it was exciting to experience something new. The Notre-Dame show was only on for a few days, so we feel fortunate to have attended. Although the Notre-Dame show replaced the usual drone show, we would still love to see the drone show someday, as we have never had the chance to watch it before.The shops at Disneyland Paris are really pricey, but you kind of expect that at Disneyland. There's not a ton of variety in what they sell, and it feels like most of it is just Stitch-themed stuff, which kind of takes away from the overall selection.I would definitely recommend a visit for all ages. There are things to do for every age group. There are many rides for thrill seekers as well as numerous rides that are slow and gentle. Even if you don't like rides there is lots of things to do like meet & greets, watch shows and parades, walk round the labyrinth, castle and also loads of photo opportunities",Food Quality

Unfortunately, the Disney parks are not very accommodating for people with coeliac disease (gluten free). At many fast-food restaurants in the park (like Bella Notte), our only options were salads/vegan food or microwave meals that resembled and tasted like baby food. At buffets you also only have a small option of foods.Most of the staff members are very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. However, there were a few staff members who weren't very friendly.For instance, while we were getting off Big Thunder Mountain, a family member accidentally dropped their phone onto the tracks. Although we knew it wasn‚Äôt a ideal situation, they could have been more understanding and friendly. They didn't keep us informed about what was happening. When we tried to explain the situation, they just shrugged, as if to say, ""What am I supposed to do?"" We stood there without any information for quite some time and got the impression that they were annoyed with us as they kept shaking their heads at us and rolling their eyes. It would have been helpful if a staff member had quickly/briefly explained what would happen next and didn't do those gestures towards us, especially since the person who dropped the phone was only struggling to get out because she is disabled. Despite the behavior of a few workers, the majority of the staff were very helpful.The priority card generally works well, but halfway through, we realized that the green color assigned to one of our family members was not correct, as she was having difficulty with the steps and getting in and out of the ride vehicles. We were unsure what to do with the card as it wasn't the correct colour. Having the green card meant we used both the premier queue and if there wasn't one we used the disabled queue. Most of the premier queues only skip half of the main queue and then merge into the normal queue. In our opinion, there should be a staff member present at every ride where the premier queue merges with the normal queue, as we faced challenges with this merging process. For example , on the Indiana Jones ride, no one wanted to let us into the queue. When we finally found a space to join, a group behind us started pointing and yelling that we had ""just pushed in,"" which attracted unwanted attention and made us feel uncomfortable. The merging experience often leads to awkwardness since people are reluctant to let you join the line. A staff member's presence would greatly alleviate this situation.Another issue we encountered was at the ride ""Le Pays des Contes de F√®es"" (the storybook boats next to Casey Jr.). The boarding area for disabled guests has a significant gap and step between the platform and the boat, making it very challenging for those with disabilities. Staff members had to physically help everyone out of the boat. In contrast, the area where guests in the normal queue board actually has a smaller gap. It would be ideal to add something like a removable platform to make exiting the boat easier. On our second attempt at riding the ride, we went through the normal queue, which meant there was a smaller step the boat as the gap wasn't as big but the actual queue stairs and the moving boat were then an issue.Queue jumping can be a significant issue in the parks, we noticed it more in the disabled queues. For instance, While we were in the disabled queue, a mother instructed her son to run past us and duck under the barriers to get ahead in line. She then pushed us aside while waving her disabled pass in our faces, insisting that her disability allowed her to go in front of us. We tried to explain that it was a queue for everyone with a disabled pass and that it's not acceptable to push ahead or send children under the barriers then catch up. Two staff members saw this happen but did not do anything, for a brief second it looked like one of the workers was going to say something but he then backed down. The workers continued to watch, and one of them eventually walked away. The worker then allowed that family on the ride before us, despite witnessing them send their under the barrier and push past us. We also had people try push in front of us on several other rides (The Parachutes, Crushes Coaster, The Story boats) . When We were waiting for the Toy Soldiers Parachute ride in the disabled queue a large family of over 25 members in front of us repeatedly rode in groups, and when each ride ended, the group would quickly run off the ride and past everyone in the disabled queue to rejoin their relatives. This meant we were in the queue for 40 minutes and if the queue didn‚Äôt move. Thankfully on the parachutes, Crushes Coaster and the boats the worker made sure whoever was queues up first could go on first. However, sadly some workers like the slinky dog worker choose not to do or say anything at all. The Christmas parade was amazing. It was wonderful to see the festive floats lit up in the dark and the characters in their Christmas outfits. We arrived an hour early to secure front-row views. It's definitely worth the wait.The fireworks were good. It was our first time watching them in over seven years, but we were a bit disappointed to see that not much had changed. However, if you haven't seen the fireworks before, you will likely enjoy them! The Notre-Dame de Paris show was nice to watch, and it was exciting to experience something new. The Notre-Dame show was only on for a few days, so we feel fortunate to have attended. Although the Notre-Dame show replaced the usual drone show, we would still love to see the drone show someday, as we have never had the chance to watch it before.The shops at Disneyland Paris are really pricey, but you kind of expect that at Disneyland. There's not a ton of variety in what they sell, and it feels like most of it is just Stitch-themed stuff, which kind of takes away from the overall selection.I would definitely recommend a visit for all ages. There are things to do for every age group. There are many rides for thrill seekers as well as numerous rides that are slow and gentle. Even if you don't like rides there is lots of things to do like meet & greets, watch shows and parades, walk round the labyrinth, castle and also loads of photo opportunities",Overall Satisfaction
The Park itself was excellent but the problem was we stayed for the display and it was late starting. The crowds were unmanageable. I saw one woman have a panic attack as she tried to leave and get through the crowds. We also tried to leave as were afraid we would miss our train ‚Ä¶there was no way out other than going through the crowds. I emailed Disney and got no reply. Just want people to know if you stay for the fireworks you cannot leave until it ends . If it is delayed you will have to wait as there is no way to get out . I would not stay for the fireworks as it was not worth the distress,Crowd Management

"Yes, the lights are pretty and the music is Christmassy, but do you like to see Characters outdoors and actually like to eat? - Then forget it. Saw no characters outdoors all day - you'll only get to see them if you can get indoors and find somewhere to eat, but the places are always packed full, blocked by staff who'll say all day ""Sorry, we're full."" We got to the park really early and spent the day starving and judging by the misery of other people, so did they. Queues for rides are too long and it's December folks. Half of the studios was closed and what remained was underwhelming. Could barely see the castle show, as it was so rammed, so we really wished we hadn't waited until 10pm and left at 3:30pm when we were going to.

We had high expectations of Disneyland but were left disappointed. Not a single character was seen roaming around. The only time we saw any was during the parade and that was for a total of 2 mins and were not seen again. Majority of the rides were closed as were other shops. This was such a waste of time for us. We only managed to get onto 2 rides and during this other rides were also closing shop hours before the firework display. The firework was the only thing worth seeing. We will not be returning.,Ride Experience

"Surprise visit to Disneyland Paris before the ride renovations started on 6/1, there is a lot of building work ongoing that others have mentioned. The Big Thunder Mountain ride was shut for most of the day (now closed for months for annual maintenance) and we had to pay for fast passes to get on it, no problem as best ride in the park.Very busy in the park on 4/1 with Christmas season finishing a day later. However able to do some rides we thought we would not get on, including Pinocchio, Peter Pan and Snow White. Some rides stupid times (Buzz Lightyear 80 minutes) for what they were.Weather was good for most of the day, some rain later which meant the drone show was cancelled but the light show was good, fireworks good as usual. Don‚Äôt bother with the parade, complete waste of time.Other gripe was Minnie was no where to be seen, replaced by Stitch at the usual character meet, sacrilege. Forced into Mickey character meet (2 hours).This place is still magical, however maybe next visit will be in a couple of years at least. Recommended.",Ride Experience

"A magical experience with your children, the good thing about being a kid is they don‚Äôt notice things that an adult does in regards to quality, price etc. a lot of walls up for maintenance but again kids not bothered or even noticed. The whole place is so clean and has that magical feeling in the air seeing the kids faces light up at almost every turn makes it amazing so credit must go to the place.With the adult head on I must warn and be frank when I say the place once through the gates is disgustingly overpriced, for example absolutely everything is fast food at Michelin prices! We were ¬£65 for 3 microwave pizzas and a portion of pasta that was rank rotten! That‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg! The full place is just a glutton for money absolutely nowhere nice to just sit and have a drink or if you fancy a bite in a nice atmosphere, ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù are a mess with chairs and tables scattered everywhere but to be fair that‚Äôs not the staffs fault as it‚Äôs the clientele that visit the place that are so ignorant and entitled‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a place that highlights all what‚Äôs wrong with the modern world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶people would rather experience it through filming on their phones, folk constantly in the way and barging past for ‚Äòthe perfect pic‚Äô‚Ä¶..a girl was even texting whilst on a ride getting whizzed round whilst furiously typing‚Ä¶..we went to the show called ‚Äòtogether‚Äô which was amazing really well done and fabulous for the kids and grown ups too I may add‚Ä¶..full grown man row in front sat with EarPods in throughout!!

"We travelled here with our daughter, son in law and his parents and our granddaughters.  This was my husband and I‚Äôs 3rd visit to Disneyland Paris and this was for a double birthday celebration.  They have been more times than us. We always stay in the Newport Bay Hotel.  Although the public areas appear updated, the rooms certainly haven‚Äôt been.  The rooms are clean enough, and the beds are very comfortable, but the furniture is in a very poor state. The drawers are very hard to open and get stuck all the time and it all looks well knocked with marks. My family remarked it had not changed in the 10 years they‚Äôve been going there. All the furniture is old and marked, the carpets could do with a wash as ‚Äòcrunchy‚Äô in places.  The casement window fell off when we tried to get some fresh air in. We had to wedge it back.  The drainage in the bath and sink was extremely slow. The hotel staff were,however, lovely and nothing was too much trouble. I would especially like to commend Fiona from the Concierge desk who went above and beyond to secure an electric mobility chair from a trusted outside source for me as I am awaiting a knee replacement and my husband and family were struggling with push type wheelchairs obtained from the Stroller shop which were not designed for this extensive kind of use.  If you need a wheelchair, see the Concierge and they can arrange the delivery of ECV from their trusted local pharmacy at very reasonable rates. The concierge also recharge your appliance for you every night when you come in for the evening with no fee. So, venturing into the two parks we noticed immediately there is extensive building work being undertaken everywhere.  Studio Universal seems to have been brought up to standards we expect with a few fast rides and digital experiences in a much more modern setting although a lot is still under wraps for refurbishment.  Queues for nearly all rides range from 55 minutes to two hours.  The Magic Kingdom, Frontierland and surrounding areas seem to just be the same and our granddaughters (aged 10 & 12) found the rides a bit tame.  More suitable for younger children I think.  Nothing has changed there at all. A lot of the rides kept being closed for technical difficulties. Indiana Jones was the only fast coaster. Thunder Mountain appears to be closed for the foreseeable future.   A lot of the food kiosks and eateries were shut. This was troublesome as the weather was awful most of the time and a nice warm drink was hard to find.  The whole place was fully booked out so it‚Äôs not like it was a quiet season. The shops seemed to have less selection than on our last visit but the prices were very high.  Again, the parks were kept clean and the public toilets always clean. Queueing time much the same in all the parks.  Sadly, because the weather was so wet nearly all the parades were cancelled and that was disappointing. There was a distinct lack of characters in the parks as well. The meet and greets in the designated places were still there but with very long queues, which in the icy rain wasn‚Äôt pleasant and our youngest got too cold standing still waiting so didn‚Äôt get half as many autographs in her book as she had hoped. Would highly recommend you take your own crisps as at ‚Ç¨6 a packet it can be costly for a snack!  We all  agreed that for us, the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô is missing in what is essentially a special place for young and old to escape from everyday life.  This is just another theme park for day trippers of which there were loads! It may be a different story when all the refurbishments have been completed but I feel that will be a few years down the line.  It was full of French and Europeans. Very few visitors from the UK.",Family Experience

I would especially like to commend Fiona from the Concierge desk who went above and beyond to secure an electric mobility chair from a trusted outside source for me as I am awaiting a knee replacement and my husband and family were struggling with push type wheelchairs obtained from the Stroller shop which were not designed for this extensive kind of use.  If you need a wheelchair, see the Concierge and they can arrange the delivery of ECV from their trusted local pharmacy at very reasonable rates. The concierge also recharge your appliance for you every night when you come in for the evening with no fee. So, venturing into the two parks we noticed immediately there is extensive building work being undertaken everywhere.  Studio Universal seems to have been brought up to standards we expect with a few fast rides and digital experiences in a much more modern setting although a lot is still under wraps for refurbishment.  Queues for nearly all rides range from 55 minutes to two hours.  The Magic Kingdom, Frontierland and surrounding areas seem to just be the same and our granddaughters (aged 10 & 12) found the rides a bit tame.  More suitable for younger children I think.  Nothing has changed there at all. A lot of the rides kept being closed for technical difficulties. Indiana Jones was the only fast coaster. Thunder Mountain appears to be closed for the foreseeable future.   A lot of the food kiosks and eateries were shut. This was troublesome as the weather was awful most of the time and a nice warm drink was hard to find.  The whole place was fully booked out so it‚Äôs not like it was a quiet season. The shops seemed to have less selection than on our last visit but the prices were very high.  Again, the parks were kept clean and the public toilets always clean. Queueing time much the same in all the parks.  Sadly, because the weather was so wet nearly all the parades were cancelled and that was disappointing. There was a distinct lack of characters in the parks as well. The meet and greets in the designated places were still there but with very long queues, which in the icy rain wasn‚Äôt pleasant and our youngest got too cold standing still waiting so didn‚Äôt get half as many autographs in her book as she had hoped. Would highly recommend you take your own crisps as at ‚Ç¨6 a packet it can be costly for a snack!  We all  agreed that for us, the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô is missing in what is essentially a special place for young and old to escape from everyday life.

Booked for the whole day and both parks. The smaller and more modern park had the newer Disney franchises and we attempted a number of rides. Always said no roller coasters but those we went on were not too scary. Luckily they were inside and in the dark. The second park more traditional and the rides less exciting. Waited through to the two light shows. Best advice. Remember where you parked as the rush at leaving is massive. Worthwhile visit but missed Micky and Minnie,Ride Experience

Due to weather conditions which would have been known much earlier during the day as it was pouring with rain and windy the entire time I was there, it wasn‚Äôt until the very end of the show we were told that due to wind, the fireworks would not occur. Whilst listening to ‚ÄòA dream is a wish your heart makes‚Äô, Disneyland Paris took my dream of wanting to see fireworks and crushed them. I am also very upset that Disneyland would have known fireworks would not be present prior to the show and did not state this until 8pm in which I and other families would have stayed and spent extra money on dinner as they waited for a show that unbeknown would not happen. If known earlier, I would have went home and enjoyed the rest of my day, rather than waste half my day waiting for fireworks. I cannot imagine how younger children felt or those who spent extra money to be placed at the front to view the show.",Event Experiences

"Having been there for Halloween 7 years prior - we were super excited to see Disney at Christmas. Would not recommend. There are crowds everywhere for everything. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel, as we had before, but the service and perks that were available then are no longer now. We opted for a superior deluxe family room for 5 and that too was a mistake. The amount you pay is not justified in any way (no close park access, no free daily fast pass for a ride, no special amenities for the kids or us. We went for new years, no special celebration at the hotel, if you want a nice dinner you won‚Äôt make a good spot at the park for the fireworks‚Ä¶ it was all in all disappointing. Obviously the team idea in general are good, the atmosphere as well. So not going for a negative rating.",Crowd Management

"The ticket price is high.  About 290 Euros for a family of three where, jokingly, a teenage son is viewed as an adult.Once inside, I found staff to be generally rude.  We were stood waiting for the ""Parade"", something we waited 45 minutes for.  Then, along come the men in red jackets, telling us to move.  Even though we were stood in the same position as other families.  When I moved forward to ask them why we had to move when we were in line with other visitors, I looked around and our place had already been taken by others.  Did they move that family on?  Nope.  And merely for questioning why my family were being treated differently to others, I was surrounded by two security guards who tried to intimidate me.  All for the princely sum of 290 Euros.Queues for rides are long, and not well documented.  Imagine queuing 1 hour for a train ride, only to find that the queue is for a boat ride.  Were there any staff we could ask about why we were queuing.  No.  Were we the only ones thinking we were queuing for a train ride.  No.  Others were too.Also, during the stay, a lot of things were closed, or ""being improved for our future enjoyment"".  A bit of a joke, really, considering for most of us it is a once in a lifetime visit.DisneyLand in HongKong was a million times better, more polite, and more organised than this complete joke of a park in Paris.  The one great thing was the nighttime fireworks and electric show.  However, you have to arrive 1 hour in advance if you want to get to see  that too.  Basically everything is 1 hour, even at the start of the day,  Rides often last 2 minutes, no more than 5.For one ride we queued 45 minutes and suddenly they opened another lane which meant about 30 people who  were behind us were now in front of us.  A similar thing happened for the boat ride.  I am not talking about the people who pay extra for ""priority"", they just suddenly opened new lanes and let other people jump ahead.Look, I am not going to dissuade anyone from visiting DisneyLand.  All I am saying is that it is overpriced, poorly organised, and staffed by people who seem to be as miserable as many of the visitors looked.  Head to the HongKong one if you can.",Ticket Pricing

"I am afraid that Disneyland Paris has gone downhill over the past few years. Having worked there in the early 2000s, and had more recent visits as a Mum with a family, I can see a stark difference. This park (of all Disney parks) now has the worst ratio of guest numbers to rides, meaning the queues are impossible. Small children cannot be expected to wait one hour for any single experience. Also, on our visit in early January 2025, there were numerous areas boarded for new construction, which should have been staggered, as it really detracts from the ""magic"". In addition, the ""Magic Hour"" (guests of Disney hotels are allowed access to the parks one hour before any non hotel guests), is now pointless, as only 3 rides opened within this hour. This was the same for each of the 3 days we tried. The management of this park have tipped many aspects into the negative, which unfortunately means the Disney magic is just not alive in this park. Despite previously being a complete advocate, I will not return to DLP. There are other parks in Europe, of other brands, that would offer much better value for money.",Crowd Management

"We were excited to go to Disneyland, we purchased one day ticket, we chose to go to Disneyland Park.  We added the bus transportation.  So to start off, i wasn't able to download the tickets so I asked for help and one of the person that works there simply said go outside and download, which i still was not able to do.  I tried with different person and he was kind enough to help us.  The parade WAS SO SAD in comparison to the Florida Disney and the California one.  It was not what we expected.  The waiting online was not so bad, however the wait for the pics with characters was long.  It was a  very cold, day we didn't stay the whole day and took the train back to Paris which was SO EASY and direct.  There were not characters out for pictures, there are more shops  than anything. I was expecting the characters out and about so we can take pictures.",Customer Service

"Customer support just horrible. Waited more than half an hour on hold without any answer while calling on a paid line. Really terrible that to cancel a booking there is no other way than to call them on a French phone number which is not free, so the longer you wait in line the more you have to pay.An easy way to cancel your reservation online should be mandatory. This is not that advanced or difficult to implement. Fix your stuff",Customer Service
"We are a family of 5. One child has ADHD and has his own access pass. One child has arthritis and has his own access pass as he likes thrill rides and other child does not. If you are entitled to a pass, get one, it's a game changer! If you didn't apply for one before you left the UK, take diagnosis documents with you and you can do there.We had a great experience with the passes. We rarely had to queue and this made our time here brilliant. Without them, I think all 5 of us would have not have had fun because of the nature of our family. We loved the rides!We loved the Disney magic. The cast members were great. We did not have one negative experience. We did experience one break down of a ride. We were on Pirates of the Carribean and the ride broke down. It took around 40 minutes for this resolved. The cast members wee great. This is something that they were used to as this ride regularly breaks down which points to a need to address is as people around us who had limited time were affected more by this. It's on every review but worth a mention..the cost of food is so high. We would have liked some hot fries so we could eat on the go but this proved difficult. At times we wanted a hot drink and this was not as easy to get as it should be.In some areas there was not enough seating. In one restaurant, there were rows of chairs but this area was closed. This is frustrating when you just want to sit and eat your food. We visited Florida last year and we naturally compared the parks.The Lion King show is better. Space Mountain is a better ride.Tower of Terror is much, much better. It is very dramatic!We didn't Ratatouille was quite as good but we still really enjoyed it. Overall, we have had a great few days here.",Family Experience

"I have visited nearly all the Disney parks, and unfortunately, Disneyland Paris ranks lowest on my list. My family and I went there during Christmas, hoping for a ""magical"" experience filled with holiday cheer, but instead, we encountered poor service that soured our visit. The cast members in other Disney parks have always been lovely and charismatic, so I had high expectations for Disneyland Paris. However, the cast members here rarely smiled and often displayed unfriendly attitudes.At Pizzeria Bella Notte, the cashier seemed annoyed that we ordered the menu deal first instead of √† la carte, as though we were supposed to know the sequence that would make her job easier. Her attitude was off-putting and frankly gave me the ick. If entering orders is challenging, perhaps some training would help, rather than blaming the customers.Later, we had dinner at the Royal Pub, which was one of the worst service experiences I‚Äôve ever had at any Disney park. Our waiter ignored us, even after I repeatedly asked for tap water. Meanwhile, he promptly attended to the family sitting next to us, taking their order without hesitation. When I finally managed to get his attention again and reminded him I had already asked for water twice, he insisted I had asked for ice instead. Instead of apologizing for neglecting us, he gaslit us and continuously interrupted me, which was both unprofessional and infuriating.I was appalled by the cast members' lack of hospitality. Disneyland Paris would benefit from implementing better training programs to improve their staff's customer service and ensure the ""magic"" Disney is known for is consistently delivered.",Customer Service

"We stayed at the Disney Hotel for 2N/3D. The hotel is really beautiful, luxurious and conveniently located right at the entrance to the Disneyland. The service levels were a disappointment, it was not upto five star standard, We were there the nights before Christmas, the park was decorated in festival lights. The parade was awesome! They made efforts to spread the festive cheer in all shows and parades. The flip side was lot of crowd, long waiting times for rides and shows. We took Premier access which helped to gain quick entry with just few minutes waiting, it was worth the money.There are renovations going on in both Disneyland & Disney Studios. So could not experience all the shows and rides. Fortunately the weather was dry for most part of our stay.",Customer Service

"It really is magical, we had a fantastic time, the park is very busy but why wouldn‚Äôt it be it‚Äôs DisneyLand. You really need premier passes as the wait times were around 60 minutes, with the premier passes we were on most rides in 5-10 minutes at the most. Some people have said you can do it all in a day which is nonsense, we didn‚Äôt do it all in 2 full 10hr days and we never stopped going from ride to ride.Lion King show was amazing, Together Pixar musical adventure with live orchestra needs to be seen to believe how great it was.Pirates of the Caribbean, Buzz lightyear Laser blast, Avengers Web were all super rides as were many others. Parade and drone show was visually spectacular. The only small thing I do believe the park could look at is the price of food, the ticket prices are high for the park already without food costing so much. Overall our family of 4 had an amazing time and hope to return soon.",Magic Atmosphere

"Disneyland Paris stands out for its quieter atmosphere compared to other Disney parks, which we appreciated. It is likely the most peaceful among them all, offering a less crowded and more relaxed experience. However, the rides felt less thrilling compared to those in other Disney parks.What significantly detracted from our visit was the prevalence of smoking, including among cast members who smoked in open-air resting areas. This greatly affects visitors seated nearby, who are forced to breathe in secondhand smoke. It is disappointing that Disney has not taken a firmer stance on managing smoking within the park.Considering that the park caters primarily to families and children, this oversight is particularly concerning. Secondhand smoke poses health risks, especially to young children, and goes against the wholesome family environment Disney strives to provide.We strongly urge Disneyland Paris management to address this issue by enforcing stricter smoking policies or relocating designated smoking areas far from where families gather. With so many children around, their health and well-being should be a top priority.",Magic Atmosphere

Too many rides that were just themed roller coasters rather than an experience related to the theme , a good example is the Indiana Jones ride which is a great ride in LA but just a roller coaster in Paris.

"Having visited Disneyland Paris back in May my girlfriend and I wanted to experience it at Christmas.This is a once and done for us, too busy, some of the staff quite rude this time and the food was average at best.Firstly the grounds and hotels, always kept clean, tidy, well presented and looking great. Part of the reason for the return was to do some of the rides which were closed on our previous trip and tindinthebOarisnChrietmss Market.Some managed to do all the rides we planned and wanted and they were as good as expected and as we remembered.Webslingers - very entertaining, fun and interactiveFlight Force - Superb, a re-themed rock'n'rollercoaster which never fails to deliveryToy Story Parachute drop - Not bad, good fun and very minimal in the intensity (looks worse than it is)Crushes Coaster - Awesome, very well presented and themed and prob quite high on the intensity for a family coaster, very good rideStar Wars Hyperspace Mountain - superb ride and better than the Florida Space mountain by farBig Thunder Mountain - Amazing, far superior to any other BTM we have ridden at other Disney parks Phantom Manor - I feel this is more true to the movies than the Florida Haunted Mansion and is a very good rideIndiana Jones Cosster - Another great addition which is very well themed and very funPirates of the Caribbean - Great but I cannot decide between this and the Florida one, I think Florida's or better tbh but this has an extra drop which is coolNow the tower of Terror... Wow this never fails to deliver, randomised drip sequences and superb theming this is a classic. We only ride it twice and both at night as it's much better then and its superb, although slightly shorter overall as it doesn't have the building swap like in Florida (this is the same setup as California), this however is imo more intense than Florida's version and is a must ride for anyone.Now the food. This is where Paris fails drastically.Firstly food options lacking, secondly seating, too many inconsiderate people sitting in food location on their phones without food and never ordering any or reserving tables when others need them as they have food. Annoyingly the staff  do nothing about this.When we ordered from Casey's corner we asked for the food in a bag to go, when we collected it was on a tray and when asked for it to be bagged the guy said should have when ordering. I did tell his we did and it was on the receipt if he'd have bothered to read it.Then the snacks, tasteless, bland and sickly at times with only a few exceptions. The Christmas gingerbread Micky was the best, soft, not over powering and very nice.The Chocolate Christmas tree - very nice and better than expected with a nice hint of hazelnut but possibly too much fake vanilla flavouring.The pistachio Boba Fett - Dry, bland, sickly and very disappointing (especially as he is my fav char) Chip and Dale cookie very cool looking but overall disappointing with next to no taste at all.Overall the trip was very good, we liked the decorations ones but it was very overcrowded, many rude people around and that was even more apparent when the parades and evening shows were on as people think it's fine to just push in trying to move you to take the spot you're in, or keep moving in front of you blocking views.Crowd control at Disneyland Paris is appealing and needs a lot of work as it's far less controlled than other Disney parks we have visited.",Crowd Management

This is where Paris fails drastically.Firstly food options lacking, secondly seating, too many inconsiderate people sitting in food location on their phones without food and never ordering any or reserving tables when others need them as they have food. Annoyingly the staff  do nothing about this.When we ordered from Casey's corner we asked for the food in a bag to go, when we collected it was on a tray and when asked for it to be bagged the guy said should have when ordering. I did tell his we did and it was on the receipt if he'd have bothered to read it.Then the snacks, tasteless, bland and sickly at times with only a few exceptions. The Christmas gingerbread Micky was the best, soft, not over powering and very nice.The Chocolate Christmas tree - very nice and better than expected with a nice hint of hazelnut but possibly too much fake vanilla flavouring.The pistachio Boba Fett - Dry, bland, sickly and very disappointing (especially as he is my fav char) Chip and Dale cookie very cool looking but overall disappointing with next to no taste at all.Overall the trip was very good, we liked the decorations ones but it was very overcrowded, many rude people around and that was even more apparent when the parades and evening shows were on as people think it's fine to just push in trying to move you to take the spot you're in, or keep moving in front of you blocking views.Crowd control at Disneyland Paris is appealing and needs a lot of work as it's far less controlled than other Disney parks we have visited.",Ride Experience
"Having visited Disneyland Paris back in May my girlfriend and I wanted to experience it at Christmas.This is a once and done for us, too busy, some of the staff quite rude this time and the food was average at best.Firstly the grounds and hotels, always kept clean, tidy, well presented and looking great. Part of the reason for the return was to do some of the rides which were closed on our previous trip and tindinthebOarisnChrietmss Market.Some managed to do all the rides we planned and wanted and they were as good as expected and as we remembered.Webslingers - very entertaining, fun and interactiveFlight Force - Superb, a re-themed rock'n'rollercoaster which never fails to deliveryToy Story Parachute drop - Not bad, good fun and very minimal in the intensity (looks worse than it is)Crushes Coaster - Awesome, very well presented and themed and prob quite high on the intensity for a family coaster, very good rideStar Wars Hyperspace Mountain - superb ride and better than the Florida Space mountain by farBig Thunder Mountain - Amazing, far superior to any other BTM we have ridden at other Disney parks Phantom Manor - I feel this is more true to the movies than the Florida Haunted Mansion and is a very good rideIndiana Jones Cosster - Another great addition which is very well themed and very funPirates of the Caribbean - Great but I cannot decide between this and the Florida one, I think Florida's or better tbh but this has an extra drop which is coolNow the tower of Terror...

"I‚Äôm disappointed with Disney Land as We were refused access with no customer service assistance to rectify the situation.We purchased passes for two visits to Disney land, the first pass was excepted and we had a wonderful day in Disney land. The second pass we decided to execute two days later only to be told the tickets were for consecutive days, there was no second date or the word consecutive on the tickets or website, Disney land tried to say its customer error they was unable to prove and when challenged to indicate the documentation information they was unable to produce any tangible documentation evidence but still refused entrance to the park. Customer service is poor at the ticket sales office with little or no help other than pay twice although we had proven a valid ticket or at worst floors between the park and their ticket providers.In my view due to evidence submitted the park should have had a duty of care to ensure the tickets were fit for purpose. In short their customer service was as much help as a hand brake on a canoe.If visiting Disney land please ensure all the dates of your visit are printed on your tickets to avoid disappointment like we endured.Please",Customer Service

"We visited on 17/18th December and stayed in Santa Fe. After seeing Halloween, I wanted to come back for the Disney Christmas Magic and I really enjoyed it! The decorations were fab and the theming as always was brilliant. Really enjoyed the Christmas parade and the Princesses. Yes it was busy, but we already expected that and we didnt really queue more than 20mins for a ride. Tried some of the themed Christmas snacks, were they amazing? No. But they were enjoyable and on par to expectations. Plenty of characters around to meet. After already going earlier on in the year, we knew what we wanted to do and see so it helped having a plan. Another good visit!",Magic Atmosphere

"While I completely appreciate the fact that this is one of the most popular places to visit... the levels of overcrowding in the park really took away any magic that I was hoping for during my recent visit. I left with genuine safety concerns with the way in which crowds were being managed during particularly busy periods for parades and night-time shows. As someone who often tries to avoid the biggest of the crowds, this was simply impossible to do without PAYING for it. Overall, the park is beautifully presented and all cast members do their best to provide exceptional customer service, but this isn't always the easiest when the stream of customers is endless. There are also some areas that are in desperate need of cleaning and maintenance. I was shocked to see how dirty the dumbo ride was, with many of the effects switched off or rusting. During the visit, there were also some technical issues that were letting the park down. Another area that needs improvement is directional signage. Good luck trying to find your way round if you're not ready to explore and hope for the best that you stumble across something you were looking for. This is particularly true at night where many areas are essentially left in complete darkness due to lights not being on, or turned very low. The characters and interactions, most of the attractions and the overall vibes are still magical - the park is completely let down by the way in which you are basically funnelled into a very crowded central plaza even if you're not wanting to watch the parades. We got stuck at the side, essentially pushed against a railing while cast members told us to 'get off the road' during the parade. We had nowhere to move to and as more people began to push past, it felt really unsafe. There needs to be a specific route set for anyone wishing to bypass this area, and staff need to do better to manage crowds and move people safely rather than just assuming everyone is there for the parade. The same is true at night as the plaza fills up 2 hours before the fireworks start. We arrived in plenty of time, and did not see a single cast member trying to manage the crowds, other than those that were telling us that certain routes had now closed, unless you had paid for the reserved areas. Lack of signage, lack of direction and lack of crowd management took away all the magic I was hoping to feel. It just felt far too busy at all times.",Crowd Management

Not really any Disney magic, more of just another theme park.   Alot smaller and of course, the weather.

"Sorry to say but for me disney did not live up to the hype.  Way too many people allowed in, making queues for food and rides ridiculous,  even with early access with magic pass. Food was ridiculously priced and poor quality. The rainforest cafe all the food was served cold. The food from the bakery was stale. The only semi decent food was in the Stark restaurant and even that wasn't great.  Shops all sold the same things and the selection inside was very limited. Hardly any characters wandering about. We did a character breakfast and they characters would disappear if you didn't get your camera out fast enough meaning we hardly got any photos with them , it was all very rushed. Although the food was OK. Main street was beautiful,  lovely decorations and very christmasy,  but no Christmas anywhere else in either parks. I was expecting more themeing around the park, but there was hardly any and it just felt like any other theme park, not the magical once in a lifetime disney experience people rave about. The parade was fantastic tho, really good ( get a spot near its a small world, it's was less crowded that end!). Didn't see the fireworks as they don't start until 10pm and my kids were exhausted by then. The rides are OK, but nothing amazing,  no better than a fairground in some instances, and some are just plain odd ( snow white!). The shows are very good but extremely loud. We stayed in the hotel ( done a separate review) for 3 nights and had 3 days in the parks. Lots of people seemingly more interested in getting a photo of themselves than enjoying the rides! And so crowded as to make the whole thing unenjoyable.  Toilets were clean and plentiful at least. Staff very efficient but not friendly really. It certainly wasn't magical and I wouldn't go back. But my kids did have a good time so there's that. Unless your a total disney nut I wouldn't bother!",Crowd Management

The rides are OK, but nothing amazing,  no better than a fairground in some instances, and some are just plain odd ( snow white!). The shows are very good but extremely loud. We stayed in the hotel ( done a separate review) for 3 nights and had 3 days in the parks. Lots of people seemingly more interested in getting a photo of themselves than enjoying the rides! And so crowded as to make the whole thing unenjoyable.  Toilets were clean and plentiful at least. Staff very efficient but not friendly really. It certainly wasn't magical and I wouldn't go back. But my kids did have a good time so there's that. Unless your a total disney nut I wouldn't bother!",Magic Atmosphere
"Sorry to say but for me disney did not live up to the hype.  Way too many people allowed in, making queues for food and rides ridiculous,  even with early access with magic pass. Food was ridiculously priced and poor quality. The rainforest cafe all the food was served cold. The food from the bakery was stale. The only semi decent food was in the Stark restaurant and even that wasn't great.  Shops all sold the same things and the selection inside was very limited. Hardly any characters wandering about. We did a character breakfast and they characters would disappear if you didn't get your camera out fast enough meaning we hardly got any photos with them , it was all very rushed. Although the food was OK. Main street was beautiful,  lovely decorations and very christmasy,  but no Christmas anywhere else in either parks. I was expecting more themeing around the park, but there was hardly any and it just felt like any other theme park, not the magical once in a lifetime disney experience people rave about.

"A fun set of parks to visit. First foreign Disney park and decidedly different from the US versions. While smaller than the Florida parks, there was still plenty to do. December has the Christmas theming, with most characters in their Christmas outfits. Lines were not too long, but having the extra magic hour before park opening when you stay on Disney property makes it easy to ride the popular rides first.",Family Experience

"I celebrated my birthday at Disneyland Paris, and it was an unforgettable experience! I enjoyed the rides, especially the Finding Nemo roller coaster, which was a thrilling adventure. Although Disneyland can be a bit pricey, the overall experience was worth it. One downside was the long wait times to take pictures with Mickey and the Disney princesses, which were around 2 hours due to the crowds. However, the night show made up for it, with an incredible display of music and lights that truly captured the magic of Disney. Overall, it was a fantastic birthday celebration filled with fun and excitement!",Ride Experience

We've waited all year to experience this holiday. And taking my young 3 children on they're very first trip abroad. We are staying in the Newport bay club and staff in the hotel have been lovely. Room is lovely and clean plenty of space etc. Bit of a que for some rides but that's fine and was expected. My issue is if you are coming here with young children don't expect some of the security guards to be helpful. I've had the most awful experience tonight and the attitude and professionalism of the 2 security guards I had the pleasure of bumping into has left me so angry. Infuriated and sent me absolutely crazy. We had left the park after a fabulous fireworks display myself 3 children (one in a pram) amd the rest of my family. It was heaving took us a while to exit. Myself and the baby in the pram got stuck in the crowd and my other 2 went ahead of me. I was stuck in the line as we all were like a heard of cows and I accidentally turned at the wrong exit quickly realised what I did at the gate and turned around quickly to catch up with my other 2 children who are 7 and 8. I was stopped by 2 security men who started shouting at ne that I'd have to leave and go in a direction I was unfamiliar with. I explained I needed to get my children and pointed at where they were heading which was just past Annette's dinner they said I had to go that way. I again told them my children are potentially on they're own I need to go to them they told me tough and that they didn't care and were pointing at where I should go. I got so anxious and upsett by this point I was trying to phone my other family members but couldn't get through I then started shouting out of fear they were so horrible and nasty. The whole thing was totally unbelievable. There I am standing there telling them my 2 young children are potentially on they're own and 2 security guards who are payed to assist and take care of paying customers of the park just didn't give a s##t.  I don't know how many times I tried to explain what had happened but they wouldn't listen.. I had no choice in the end but to scream the place down and only then they allowed me to go in  after causing such a scene. I got through to my dad eventually and thankfully told me my other 2 children were with my mum. My dad came down to meet me because I was so in shock and upset. He went to ask the 2 security guards for badge numbers one was very confrontational with him and pushed his upper body into him to show his badge. Got back to the hotel to make a complaint and found out they had lied to cover they're tracks and said I was trying to enter the disney village when that wasn't really the case so just shows they didn't listen to a word I said. Absolutely disgusting behaviour from 2 individuals who's duty of care basically is there to protect the guests but they couldn't give 2 hoots that a 7 and 8 year old could have been wondering the place on they're own. Them laughing at me when I was clearly upset says it all.,Staff Friendliness

"Avoid this park. Prices are disgusting. Costing nearly 3pound for a bottle of coke also 16pound for a burger meal. The airport staff fobbed us off every chance they got and directed us to the wrong places resulting in us missing our train, which may I add are not as priced as online but 4 to 5 euros more. Costing us double for another ticket. We were given a room that was currently being occupied,walking in on another guest in there own room. And then the cost of snacks and merchandise etc which nothing was under 4 euros you can easily spend a couple of grand here if you are a family of four, Its all a big money grabbing scam. The happiest place on earth ,yeah If your financially able to or it ruins everything",Ticket Pricing

"Worst Disneyland so far (I‚Äôve been to the parks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and California). We left this place devastated and frustrated from our experience. We were treated so badly because we were Malaysian Indians and didn‚Äôt look French of course . Most of the staffs were rude to us (especially Casey‚Äôs corner, the waiter was Indian and assumed we were from India, started arguing with us, pushed us back ) . Some kind of racism going on around here . Some rides had technical issues while riding it. Kept stopping and restarting back. Rests of the guests were also rude to us, one man pushed us and his lady showed the middle finger to us. We were shocked to see this kind of attitude. There was also a point when a mother quickly pulled her child away when she passed by us. It‚Äôs not like we were gonna kidnap her child! The worst part was when we returned to the train station to board the train back to our hotel, we were targets of a pickpocket attempt at Marne La Vall√©e Chessy station. The pickpocket took my mom‚Äôs purse and to her dismay there was no cash/credit card inside (we have kept it elsewhere) , so the pickpocket threw away the purse and left the train. Honestly, we didn‚Äôt feel safe at all. Not even at Disneyland. We will not be returning to Paris ever. No one treats us well , always rude to us, and has some kind of stereotype about Indians. It was a mistake thinking Paris Disneyland would be a happy place! Regret our decision visiting this place filled with racism.",Staff Friendliness

Definitely need to check this Disneyland out- we had just a one day ticket luckily the snow had settled but it was still cold and luckily not as crowded as I know Disneyland can be. Different experience with cold and snow but the highlight was the Ratatouille ride-meal and the associated food chalets with cheesy food if we hadn‚Äôt booked for dinner I would have definitely eaten there. the lion king show was really good singing and dancing and acrobatic acts.It was great to tick this  Disneyland off our list not one of the bigger ones but still worth seeing.,Ticket Pricing

"We stayed on site for 3 nights & easily got everything done. Mid week in December. One night was very foggy and you couldn‚Äôt see the drone show and they cancelled the fireworks.The fast pass was very expensive, over ‚Ç¨20 per person on some rides. So we didn‚Äôt buy it. We didn‚Äôt do drop drop, but these are the rides to head to if you do. Or wait until late when the fireworks are about to start. Our longest queue of just over an hour was Peter Pan & Crush Coaster. Both good rides. Our must do was to buy a plastic keepsake glass of champagne. ‚Ç¨20 each, but lovely. Only buy on food cart at end of Main Street outside Gibson Girl. I did get to keep a cork too.Favourite ride is Thunder Mountain. Better and faster than Florida. We did it after dark and the lighting make it even more thrilling. Indiana Jones is a quick moving queue & the upside down loop wasn‚Äôt that bad.Everyday at least 1 main ride broke down. Space Mountain & Pinocchio were. Loved for refurb. There is lots of disruption due to building works. Food and alcohol is very expensive everywhere.Lots of shops with same stuff. We found the jewellery quite reasonably priced. I agree with an earlier review, too much LILO & Stitch stuff. The park was crowded and the parade route is short. Very good light parade. There was something in the afternoon but it wasn‚Äôt listed on the App? We just bumped into it at the main entrance. Mickey, Minnie & Santa at the station & Goofy & dancers in street. This was 2.30pm.The drone show is good but could be better. The fireworks are really sad compared to Florida and the music was unmemorable. A lot of stuff is in French. Star Tours was in French. Why can‚Äôt they also have rides in English like they do with some of the shows.The park & the hotels are all looking very tired. Dull paint work and scruffy pavements. Not magical at all. We  love Christmas, but felt there should have been more decorations in Studios and Disney village. I think the parks must look really sad when not decorated. Most of the queuing areas are outside. So you are out in the cold or heat, also not shade if it rains or is really sunny.",Crowd Management

One night was very foggy and you couldn‚Äôt see the drone show and they cancelled the fireworks.The fast pass was very expensive, over ‚Ç¨20 per person on some rides. So we didn‚Äôt buy it. We didn‚Äôt do drop drop, but these are the rides to head to if you do. Or wait until late when the fireworks are about to start. Our longest queue of just over an hour was Peter Pan & Crush Coaster. Both good rides. Our must do was to buy a plastic keepsake glass of champagne. ‚Ç¨20 each, but lovely. Only buy on food cart at end of Main Street outside Gibson Girl. I did get to keep a cork too.Favourite ride is Thunder Mountain. Better and faster than Florida. We did it after dark and the lighting make it even more thrilling. Indiana Jones is a quick moving queue & the upside down loop wasn‚Äôt that bad.Everyday at least 1 main ride broke down. Space Mountain & Pinocchio were. Loved for refurb. There is lots of disruption due to building works. Food and alcohol is very expensive everywhere.Lots of shops with same stuff. We found the jewellery quite reasonably priced. I agree with an earlier review, too much LILO & Stitch stuff. The park was crowded and the parade route is short. Very good light parade. There was something in the afternoon but it wasn‚Äôt listed on the App? We just bumped into it at the main entrance. Mickey, Minnie & Santa at the station & Goofy & dancers in street. This was 2.30pm.The drone show is good but could be better. The fireworks are really sad compared to Florida and the music was unmemorable. A lot of stuff is in French. Star Tours was in French. Why can‚Äôt they also have rides in English like they do with some of the shows.The park & the hotels are all looking very tired. Dull paint work and scruffy pavements. Not magical at all. We  love Christmas, but felt there should have been more decorations in Studios and Disney village. I think the parks must look really sad when not decorated. Most of the queuing areas are outside. So you are out in the cold or heat, also not shade if it rains or is really sunny.",Park Cleanliness

"I visited Disneyland Paris in December with my partner and two year old son. I have been to Paris a handful of times but i have been lucky enough to also experience Disney World in Florida. Disneyland is split into two parks -:Disneyland which is the equivalent to Magic Kingdom and is basically the same as the US one and the other park, which is next door, is Walt Disney Studios, similar to Disney MGM studios in Florida but smaller..This review is merely about Disneyland. Firstly, i stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and although expensive it was really worth the money due to the ease of access with it directly next to the entrance to the park. I prefer visiting Disneyland at Christmas time due to the generic atmosphere and the Christmas Spirit, from walking down Main Street seeing the snow falling down to the christmas parades that take place. Each morning at opening Mickey and Minnie stand on the balcony looking down at the guests and waving and we noticed this was every morning which was nice for the little ones. I will break the review down into the main Pro‚Äôs and cons -:Pro‚Äôs - The Atmosphere throughout the park, especially at Christmas, is amazing and well presented with the Christmas tree and decorations and the spirit of Christmas throughout the entire park from the music to the various different stalls and drinks servers scattered around. I often forgot about the struggles of life whilst enjoying myself throughout the park. The staff were friendly and accommodating and there were many about. I don‚Äôt think i had any staff member who was rude or gave a negative attitude and many were forthcoming to help you where needed.The shops were not too badly priced for presents such as toys and the prices i paid is something i would expect to pay even if back in England. I did think it would be considerably more considering where we were but it wasn‚Äôt too bad.Cons-:There is literally shops everywhere selling the same stuff, i think this could be cut down and maybe consider more rides or activities instead of the constant shop after shop.Ensure you get to the fireworks early (from 9pm i would reserve) as this can get very very busy with crowds and you often find yourself being pushed or barged. Also check the weather as we watched the fireworks/laser show when fog set in and the castle could not be seen at all to which most people left. This will save a wasted trip, also if there is wind or any sign of bad weather the drones will not be flown which can affect the electric show. Speaking of the electric show i wasn‚Äôt really fond of it and i personally feel it is not Disney enough, if that makes sense.Where are all the characters hiding? We literally saw the same characters in the same place every day such as Winnie the Pooh at the entrance, Balou by Adventure Land however there was no Mary Poppins, Buzz Lightyear or any other main character at all however i personally saw Chip and Dale so many times but i don‚Äôt think i even knew who they were until someone told me. I think times have changed now where children watch more modern disney programmes/movies so therefore more options would be better character wise rather than the same ones.Very busy which causes the queue times to be very long. Fastpass is also around ¬£9 per ride which you can only use once, the ‚Äúunlimited fastpass‚Äù also only allows you to go onto a ride only once and cannot be used numerous times so be careful of that. i love Christmas at Disney and as much as i have mentioned the cons i still cannot get over the happiness on my childs face when he see‚Äôs woody or the lights and for that i will continue to come each year however i think people need to realise that this is Disney, it is a business which is famous worldwide so therefore they need to expect some of the prices to be higher than expected.",Magic Atmosphere

"This was our 15th visit to Disneyland Paris and we've been really impressed. We decided to stay at the Disneyland Hotel to enjoy a special experience, and I've reviewed this separately.Disneyland Park itself is beautiful as always. Christmas decorations this year are even more magical than ever, plenty of colour and the periodic Main Street USA events are great to experience. I'd definitely say to everyone that you must visit Disneyland Paris just for how beautiful the park is and exhilarating the attractions are, while providing a wide variety of intensities around different theming to suit all individuals unlike no other theme park I've visited can.Food has massively improved across the park. We visited Walt's - an American Restaurant, Captain Jack's Restaurant des Pirates and a few fast food restaurants within the park. Food is now high-quality, flavourful and consistent across all the outlets we visited while actually being a reasonable price to what I'm used to in the UK (3 course fine dining meal is approximately 55 euros). Service in restaurants was good in some and inconsistent in others, but still the magic atmosphere remains.Disney Illuminations are spectacular and I'm hoping the new version coming next year lives up to expectations! The Magical Sky Parade was a lovely addition too. However, I was slightly disappointed that the VIP viewing area was quite large and unavailable for purchase during my visit despite staying at the Disneyland Hotel, meaning members of our party got quite tight into a zone with plenty of VIP space next to it just to get a good view while Disney Cast Members attempted to strictly enforce the no-entry rule which didn't really compliment the experience and would make some uncomfortable.Merchandise has also improved since our last visit, I'm pleased they have gone back to varied merchandise throughout different stores which makes shopping more exciting. Christmas merchandise was more restricted but I appreciate the beautiful designs, more baubles like usual please!Service has got slightly better but significantly better on attractions, queues being much more organised and controlled. Premier Access is still quite expensive but worth it.I was hesitating whether to add a 4 or 5 star rating, however, I decided on 5 due to the massive improvements and our families' desire to return very soon. I'd highly recommend to everyone and thank Disneyland Paris for making these valid improvements which fans have suggested!",Magic Atmosphere

"This was our 15th visit to Disneyland Paris and we've been really impressed. We decided to stay at the Disneyland Hotel to enjoy a special experience, and I've reviewed this separately.Disneyland Park itself is beautiful as always. Christmas decorations this year are even more magical than ever, plenty of colour and the periodic Main Street USA events are great to experience. I'd definitely say to everyone that you must visit Disneyland Paris just for how beautiful the park is and exhilarating the attractions are, while providing a wide variety of intensities around different theming to suit all individuals unlike no other theme park I've visited can.Food has massively improved across the park. We visited Walt's - an American Restaurant, Captain Jack's Restaurant des Pirates and a few fast food restaurants within the park. Food is now high-quality, flavourful and consistent across all the outlets we visited while actually being a reasonable price to what I'm used to in the UK (3 course fine dining meal is approximately 55 euros). Service in restaurants was good in some and inconsistent in others, but still the magic atmosphere remains.Disney Illuminations are spectacular and I'm hoping the new version coming next year lives up to expectations! The Magical Sky Parade was a lovely addition too. However, I was slightly disappointed that the VIP viewing area was quite large and unavailable for purchase during my visit despite staying at the Disneyland Hotel, meaning members of our party got quite tight into a zone with plenty of VIP space next to it just to get a good view while Disney Cast Members attempted to strictly enforce the no-entry rule which didn't really compliment the experience and would make some uncomfortable.Merchandise has also improved since our last visit, I'm pleased they have gone back to varied merchandise throughout different stores which makes shopping more exciting. Christmas merchandise was more restricted but I appreciate the beautiful designs, more baubles like usual please!Service has got slightly better but significantly better on attractions, queues being much more organised and controlled. Premier Access is still quite expensive but worth it.I was hesitating whether to add a 4 or 5 star rating, however, I decided on 5 due to the massive improvements and our families' desire to return very soon.

"People say Disney is meant to be ‚ÄòThe happiest place in earth‚Äô but sadly that wasn‚Äôt my experience.  The facilities at the park were great and the food and drinks, and as expensive as to be expected. The shows are also great, and the rides are fun. Sadly the aggressive nature of a lot of the other guests really spoils it. We took my MiL who is in a wheel chair, and honestly so many times she was banged into and pushed about as people rushed to get in front of her, particularly on the buses between the parks and the hotels. We missed several buses that we could have taken purely because of this. The attitude of others really ruined the experience for me and my family. I also thought the merchandise went really heavy on Lilo and Stitch at the expense of some older but brilliant characters missing",Crowd Management

"Having visited disneyland paris 5 times in the past we couldn't wait to return, although it had been 15 years since our last visit, we still had many magical memories from previous visits but what a disappointment it was when we got there!The park is now 30 years old and it's clearly showing its age, from broken pavements to 90% of the rides breaking down, etc.  They clearly need to spend money on fixing this park and not spending money on the new frozen park which is certainly not going to improve things.The waiting ques are atrocious, we were waiting about an hour for each ride, we don't remember it ever being this bad, then they want 16 euro to skip the que for peter pan, this is just ridiculous!Almost 90% of the rides we went on broke down, including thr rail road train and crushes coaster, which was the only one who gave us a fast pass as an apology!Some rides have changed and not for the better, such as the cars road trip which is just awful now, it was better before!The shops sell the same old merch as each other, you used to get different stuff in each shop/different parts of the park and the prices are ludicrous ¬£8 for a plastic pen, come on?!There was a lot of meet and greets with characters, which was definitely an improvement from previous visits and the disney app had its advantages, although it wasn't the most accurate and really needs updated, such as the list of places you can use your food pass at and upto date menus.We bought a food pass which was definitely worth the money as the prices were just shocking for what you actually got especially at our previous favourite, Annette's diner which was absolutely disgusting.The park has definitely changed in regards to health and safety, with seatbelts on many rides such as the carousel and other rides but these seatbelts hardly fit adults (I'm only a size 12 and I'm struggled, the staff waste time checking everyone's seatbelt and giving out extensions surely they could put an announcement out and make all seatbelts longer to save time and cut down ques?I lost count of how many times I tripped and witnessed people tripping up over the kerbs and broken pavements, this is definitely an issue that needs addressed and as for cleanliness, there was rubbish everywhere, visitors don't seem to care!The weather was cold and icy when we visted but yet not a bit of grit in sight, which made the paths so slippery.The parades have definitely improved from what I remember from previous visits and was definitely worth seeing and the illuminations were really good, probably the best thing we experienced.The security has been increased with  lots of security checks, such as bag searches, sniffer dogs, police, etc which isn't a bad thing!I could go on but there is many things that need to be addressed at disneyland, as I doubt we wouldn't return anytime soon.The magic definitely isn't there anymore and many things need fixed to bring the magic back.",Overall Satisfaction

"We found this visit really disappointing unfortunately, for a number of reasons.1. There were NO photo pass photographers anywhere! Isn‚Äôt that part of the experience? In LA they‚Äôre everywhere. 2. The characters were few and far between, and you had to queue for ages to meet them/get a photo etc. In LA they‚Äôre everywhere.3. Limited options for food without making a reservation. I understand amazing places book up months ahead but everywhere else seemed to close up early so if you were at the park late you had really limited options. 4. Nobody seemed to know where I could buy stamps to post the postcards I purchased from Disneyland. I was sent on a wild goose chase! Hot top if anyone else needs them - I had to go to the booth where they rent out prams to get them in the end ? 5. I have a small baby and I‚Äôm breastfeeding. It‚Äôs also freezing cold because it‚Äôs winter. There was nowhere I could find to sit down indoors to feed my baby. Apparently there is one room available for this somewhere, but I couldn‚Äôt find it. I went into a cafe to ask if I could sit down - the lady snapped at me telling me I could only sit down if I bought food. That was fine, but my baby was screaming. She could see we were both distressed. Then while my husband went to get our lunch, I asked a man who was seating people if I could sit down to feed my baby while my husband got our lunch. He told me off like I was a child and pointed to a sign that said you can‚Äôt sit until you‚Äôve bought food. It was absolutely humiliating. I get it, there‚Äôs rules, but in a place like Disney that‚Äôs supposed to be family friendly, it really didn‚Äôt feel it. 6. In the same restaurant, we observed an older gentleman in a wheelchair being wheeled out by his son. TWO waitstaff stood doing nothing and watched them struggle to get through the door! In the end another patron stood up from her meal to get the door for them. 7. Not a huge deal but those iconic badges that say if it‚Äôs your first visit, your birthday, etc were nowhere to be found. Apparently it‚Äôs something only hotel guests get? Not sure if it‚Äôs just in Paris or everywhere but disappointing all the same. In LA they were so kind and helpful. In Paris they just didn‚Äôt seem to care. They‚Äôve lost the ethos of what Disney is about. Very disappointing",Overall Satisfaction

"3 weeks after my trip and I still have the Disney blues! I have wanted to go all my life and it did not disappoint, DLP is an AMAZING place! Everything from the theming of the hotels, restaurants and shops to the rides and characters was perfect! We visited during Christmas so it was incredible to see all the Christmas decorations, the drone show and the Christmas parade. It jump started our festive season and felt like magic. Obviously it is not cheap to go, or when you‚Äôre there, but it is Disneyland and is to be expected. We fell very lucky with the weather which made the whole trip even more enjoyable. The app was great too and really helped us organise our day and overall trip. I loved everything about it and can‚Äôt wait to go again one day!",Magic Atmosphere

As we rented a house in Esbly we were only 8 minutes away. We arrived before 10.00 and passing security and the entrance went smoothly. Then the wait started. You can see in the app and per attraction what the waiting time is. 1 - 2 hours of waiting is no exception. The park is nice and the attractions are great but waiting 2 hours for a 2 minute ride is not funny. We were with teenagers and focused on the rollercoasters but also did 'it's a small world', Alice's Curious Labyrinth, Autopia and the railroad. It was nice to sit for a while in a cool place during Mickey‚Äôs PhilharMagic. We have seen and experienced it and we don't think about it to come back. The hot temperature and long waiting lines aren't worth it. The price (we paid almost USD 80 per person with a Family and Friends ticket) is also not attractive to try it another time. Restaurants, food stands, and souvenir shops are also extremely expensive, but they think they can justify it because it's Disney. The crew we interacted with is also not friendly and looks stressed but what you imagine with these big crowds? When we wanted to fill our water bottles (they have some water fountains) a lady started shouting to us because it was the area for the disabled people to watch the parade. Way too much stress. We have seen it, it was a nice experience, but the long lines, high price and stressed crew doesn't attract us to come back.",Crowd Management

"This is my 5th visit since 2017 and sad to say it's lost the appeal and magic it used to have. I usually receive an email from Disney asking for feedback but it's been a week since I've been back and got nothing. That says a lot!The cost cutting is evident in the parks, closing earlier than last year, the parks open at 9:30am but some rides don't open untill 11.00am this is what pissed me off the most.If the parks open it should all be operational!The Christmas decorations are the same year in year out, this year tho some cheap red ribbons tied around some lampposts and fake poinsettias in hanging baskets. Once you leave main street and venture into the parks you'd forget it was christmas. The castle twinkling lights on the turrets weren't turned on and never saw the advertised Christmas drone show at all it was the normal Disney electrical sky parade.Walls (not a typo) Disney studios is a mess, an absolute mess. To be charged full price to enter that park is a joke. A one ride frozen land won't fix this either.It's split down the middle with one walk way to get to either side of the ""park"" so rammed with people. The avengers campus toilet's are bad, and others dotted around the parks, no hot water,some taps not working,hand dryers not working and no paper to dry your hands. Lovely.Food and drink are extortionate and honestly not worth it for such basic food.Smoking/vaping and smoking cannabis is an issue in the parks and village.The lion king rhythm of the pride lands is amazing! Cast and crew well done! Can't recommend a visit and have not been with when friends ask how it went. Save ya hard earned money and go on a beach holiday all inclusive for 10 nights for what these conmen charge.",Magic Atmosphere

"Three days at Disneyland Paris with the family. The park was good, but some things worth mentioning for future travelers. It was cold. And the cold, in my opinion, is an obstacle to enjoying the park fully, since you have to wear several layers of clothes, every once in a while look for a Disney store or restaurant to enter and warm up a bit, and if it rains (as it did one day) then it is really challenging - I was with both my grandsons, 8 months old and 3 yrs old - since you need to cover them up and try to keep them dry. Next time I would certainly opt for a warmer season, even facing more visitors. Another cold factor was the ""cold"" reception by some of the staff there at Disneyland Paris. My French is OK, but my English much better. When asking to switch  to English there was a clear change in the attitude o some Disney personnel I came in contact with, at the kiosks especially. It looked like many of them were stressed out (my impression). It also seems that they reserve the low winter season to revamp the park, so many you see many closed maintenance areas. Needless to say that food and drinks in general there are very expensive, but that is a given.

And the cold, in my opinion, is an obstacle to enjoying the park fully, since you have to wear several layers of clothes, every once in a while look for a Disney store or restaurant to enter and warm up a bit, and if it rains (as it did one day) then it is really challenging - I was with both my grandsons, 8 months old and 3 yrs old - since you need to cover them up and try to keep them dry. Next time I would certainly opt for a warmer season, even facing more visitors. Another cold factor was the ""cold"" reception by some of the staff there at Disneyland Paris. My French is OK, but my English much better. When asking to switch  to English there was a clear change in the attitude o some Disney personnel I came in contact with, at the kiosks especially. It looked like many of them were stressed out (my impression). It also seems that they reserve the low winter season to revamp the park, so many you see many closed maintenance areas. Needless to say that food and drinks in general there are very expensive, but that is a given.

A strange Disney Park I normally go to the Florida one but fancied a mini disney break. Good stuff*Disney Staff were great...*Thunder mountain is better than the florida one.* The train station is literally at the door* Magic Kingdom is impressiveBad Stuff* Hollystudios is more like a building site at the moment.* Disney Village is rubbish compared to Disney springs and the redevelopment plans look rubbish too.*Indiana Jones ride is dreadful and its really a cheap funfair ride thats had theming slapped onto it.*French people - They have a cultural habit of walking straight at you and expect YOU to move. I got fed up of moving out of their way so one attempted to push me in the middle of main street (think about the space they could have used)*RUBBISH WIFI - sorry Disney I can't pay for stuff online like fast track if your wifi is rubbish.,Staff Friendliness

"This was my second trip of 2024 and it was just as magical as the first! My dad came with us this time for his first Disney Parks Holiday and he is already wanting to plan the next one!We saw Disney in the snow which was wonderful, however I did get soaked and cold because we were not anticipating this so I would personally pack waterproof shoes and lots of layers because you can take layers off if you get too hot!I would say it was lacking in the merch department but that could also be because I have been to Florida twice and I was spoilt for choice there! The prices were reasonable though for most things and I just adore my new Disneyland Paris Fantasia Spirit Jersey!Overall, it was the most magical way to start this festive season and I look forward to planning another trip soon!",Magic Atmosphere

"Although I'm not such a big Disney fan compared to when I was younger, I visited Disneyland Paris alongside my brother in September as he really wanted to see this. It is only the second Disneyland park I've visited as I went to the Orlando one many years ago. And I can say that it was pretty good, with various attractions from different Disney Films, including both Pixar and films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe/MCU (the latter of which was quite nice as I've recently started watching some MCU films). I also enjoyed watching the Disney parade with different Disney characters in the evening. There were also different eating areas present and the food I ate in the Stark Tower inside the MCU area was relatively good. Another thing I liked was that this place is easily accessible by public transport with an RER train line connecting the area directly with Central Paris (very convenient for us and I can say most of the other Disneyland Parks in the USA definitely need to take note from this), and it is also possible to get there by bus, taxi and high speed rail, not to mention it is also possible to get there by driving - although if you're a tourist, I strongly recommend getting there by public transport.The only things I didn't like were that the admissions prices were quite expensive (although it was worth it just for seeing this area) and the website was a bit misleading as the website stated that tickets should be bought online and wasn't clear enough that you could purchase tickets directly from there (I'm glad we could still buy tickets there as we otherwise wouldn't have been able to see this place). I would also advise anyone going there to go there early in the day (or if possible visit it in the span of two days) as since the park is so large, it can be difficult to see most of the rides - I only managed to get on one or two rides as there wasn't enough time. But apart from those, I did enjoy my time in Disneyland Paris a lot despite only spending a day there.",Ride Experience

"We had a fabulous time at Disneyland Paris recently.  Flew to Paris then took the fast train straight to the Disneyland station, well worth doing the train as it only takes 10 mins though it was full and we had to stand.  Had a half day in Universal park then a full day and a half in the Disneyland park.  Went on lots of rides though had to queue for most of them but expected that.  The parade was amazing and the lights on the castle at night were fantastic.  An absolutely fab time was had by all and will def go again.",Ride Experience

And we had none of that.Please contact me on my refund .Best Regards Angelica Rodriguez.",Customer Service
"Where to begin... Maud in the restaurant near Star Wars needs a serious attitude adjustment, Other staff disinterested, talking amongst themselves and some glued to mobile phones while managing queues... Many of the rides are closed and there's building work right in the main area where you enter and leave the park... IMHO, having been to Orlando 3 times and here once, I'd never visit Paris again... Just poor in general.",Customer Service

"I wouldnt go again to be honest. The food was terrible, I dont mind paying over priced for decent food but Mc donalds food was better than the two restaurants we went to in the park. The que for chip and dale was 1.5 hours long with them having 3 'mini breaks'. The rides were never less than 30minutes mostly 45-1 hour. Not a lot of character viewing and all were spread so far apart making it nearly impossible to get to all. I think the buzz lightyear ride broke down not sure if it was part of the ride but it certainly diddnt make the ride any better. Lots of agro between people at firework and parade time, mostly adults arguing and pushing, one lady pushed my 9 year old to get more to the front feel this needs better arranging. The hotel offered 'free coffee' 2 free a day but when we finally found the machine you couldnt fit our standard size mugs in them. You have to pay extra to visit mikey. The 're fillable' drinks means going and paying for another drink with the same cup, you have a qr code that only allows one use. We paid for the lion king show and was 1 minute late and not allowed in, it diddnt state you needed to be half an hour early like the lady told us when she refused us entrance.",Food Quality

"We visited last weekend in October and the parks were at full capacity! It was very busy, que for the toilets, que for a drink/snacks, que for lunch, que for rides etc. we did manage to get quite alot of rides in though surprisingly, the app helps telling you the ride queue times so you can plan the day better. We have been before so we knew what to expect and we had a plan of which rides we wanted to go on. My son is just 1.2m tall so we were able to go on some really big rides and his first upside down rollercoaster (avengers). We had a great weekend, the drone and fireworks show is very impressive.Next time we will come mid week though and avoid the weekends.The halloween decorations aren't anything special so not really worth coming in october just for this.",Crowd Management

"I've been coming to Disneyland Paris for the last 20 years, but this is the first time I've felt that the Disney magic was missing. There are lots of renovations and new building works going on particularly at Disney Studios. The background noise of diggers and hoarding erected everywhere were intrusive and made the area feel even more crowded. We visited during the week after half term, and it was crazy busy. It feels that there is no control over visitor numbers, and this has resulted in ridiculously long waits on all rides. Not sure if I am likely to return any time soon.",Magic Atmosphere

"Wow, where do you start. Firstly I went to Disneyland Paris 20 years ago and had a fantastic time so I was looking forward to sharing this place with my family. I booked the family of four tickets and arrived at 10:00. We had the app and booked lunch at 12:00. We decided to go to Big Thunder Mountain as the app said it was a 55 minute wait. We got to the line at 10:50 and finished the ride at 12:40! Almost two hours and missed our lunch. We ended up buying four pretty average burritos and four drinks for ‚Ç¨75 and set out again. In the eight hours we were at the park we 6 hours were spent in queues. We managed 5 rides in that whole time. Even buying a hot chocolate took half an hour and so we just gave up around 18;00. Unless you are willing to spend big on queue jumping passes (which I morally object to) you need the patience of a saint to come to Disneyland Paris. The magic has drained out of this place which is unbelievably sad",Crowd Management

"As expected, all of the parades, lights shows and most of the rides are great. What is poor is the interaction in the park. We'd been telling our little girl to expect to meet all her favourite characters but over 2 full days in the park we only saw the D list characters Pluto, Tigger and Jafar (all in photo areas with long lines).We booked a character breakfast so thought that would improve matters but instead we got Pinocchio, Gepeto, Captain Hook, Smee and Eeyore. Not a single child new who Gepeto and Smee were. For the obscene amount of money this place rakes in, surely they could afford to populate it with some Mickeys, Minnie's, Princesses or the parks unofficial mascot Stitch who is just everywhere.We stayed in Sequoia Lodge and for the price, you'd expect luxury but all meals are extra cost (25 euros for a buffet breakfast, 45 for evening meal) and the only luxury was a kettle and coffee machine (but no mini fridge for milk and the like)",Ride Experience

"Disneyland Paris delivers exactly what you would expect: a magical and fun-filled destination packed with music, entertainment, thrilling rides, and shops brimming with Disney-themed treasures. The park offers so much to see and do, all while being impeccably maintained to the highest standard. Adding to the experience are the friendly and helpful staff who go out of their way to ensure that guests have a memorable time.One of the downsides, however, comes not from the park itself but from some of the visitors. The sheer number of guests with camera phones can be overwhelming, especially those who seem to be there solely for photo opportunities. It‚Äôs not uncommon to see people changing into various outfits and posing with props, which can make popular spots like the iconic castle more crowded than usual.That said, if you can manage to look past these camera-focused visitors and enjoy the park on your own terms, the experience remains highly enjoyable. The key to having a great time at Disneyland Paris is to embrace the crowds and plan accordingly. Yes, it‚Äôs busy‚Äîbut that‚Äôs to be expected. By using the official Disneyland app to track ride times and plan your day, you can maximize your experience and cover more ground. The app is an invaluable tool for navigating the park efficiently.One visit to Disneyland Paris is best spread over several days to truly take in all the attractions and entertainment it offers. And be prepared for lots of walking; it‚Äôs a sprawling space that will have you getting in plenty of steps by the end of your stay.In summary, Disneyland Paris is a vibrant, well-maintained theme park full of fun and wonder. While the crowds and camera-centric visitors can be a slight drawback, the overall magic of the park more than makes up for it.

"Had such a wonderful Halloween trip to Disneyland Paris.  Stayed in the beautiful Newport Bay Hotel in a Compass Club room.  The hotel and the staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble.  They made the whole stay fun and really engaged with our granddaughter.  The staff made sure that we had everything we needed for a perfect stay.  The park looked beautiful with the Halloween decorations and the 'villains' who were located at various areas of the park were great fun.  The rides, although busy, were worth the wait.  There was a good range of food and drink available around both parks and the parades and shows were very enjoyable.  Our granddaughter visited the princess pavilion and also had a princess breakfast which she absolutely loved.  We were also lucky enough to get the Royal Dream for her and she was treated like a princess from start to finish!  This was certainly a holiday she won't forget!Although the Studios park is under renovation at present, there was a good range of rides and the shows available were excellent.  There were also Marvel characters roaming around the area so we had good interactions there too.We would definitely visit again at Halloween - or any other time of the year in all honesty!!",Family Experience

They made the whole stay fun and really engaged with our granddaughter.  The staff made sure that we had everything we needed for a perfect stay.  The park looked beautiful with the Halloween decorations and the 'villains' who were located at various areas of the park were great fun.  The rides, although busy, were worth the wait.  There was a good range of food and drink available around both parks and the parades and shows were very enjoyable.  Our granddaughter visited the princess pavilion and also had a princess breakfast which she absolutely loved.  We were also lucky enough to get the Royal Dream for her and she was treated like a princess from start to finish!  This was certainly a holiday she won't forget!Although the Studios park is under renovation at present, there was a good range of rides and the shows available were excellent.

"We visited Disneyland Paris over the Halloween period, and it is definitely a must. The Halloween decorations was amazing and everywhere tou looked, you knew it was Halloween. The shows were very good and I would highly recommend them. We had 3 and a half days at the parcs, and we managed to do most of the rides and 3 shows. The children loved Micky mouse and Mini and all the other characters. we managed to get 11 signatures and pictures of a few more. Would highly advise the breakfast with the characters if you can afford it, if not, don't worry, you can see most of them around the parc but you will have to que anything from 10 - 30 minutes all times are on the app and locations.The disney app is very good and accurate on waiting times. Most of the time, one day it was a bit off but you can look for yourself.We managed to do all of the things we wanted to do in the 3 and a half days and I will tell you now you need your walking boots we covered 75000 steps in the time we where there.There are plenty of toilets on the site and very well located.There are water dispensers in many locations so to save money we used water bottles and used squash to top it up and add flavour. We had the small squeeze bottles that give you about 20 fills.The place is amazing as with everywhere similar the cost of drink and food is a bit pricey but the place is magical and make the most of it.",Seasonal Events

"It is 1 million % worst it to visit. We ourselves were in 2 minds because the kids are close to teens and we thought kids might not be interested. But wow, forget the kids, we ourselves as adult enjoyed it so much that can't describe it.all ages of people come there and have so much for all to have fun. It is an experience of life time. We as adults go back to our childhood. So many rides and waiting time is not much on a weekday. I mean 15 to 25 minutes but chit chatting, taking pictures, munching few stuff, the time passes and then when you go through that experience then you realise it was worth the wait. Amazing amazing amazing experience and one must go to Disneyland if in Paris.both the parks can be done easily in one day, no need to buy 2 day pass.",Ride Experience

"An amazing 4 day trip with family and greater family. The parades were brilliant, shows we worth the early que and wait. recommend the lion king and mickey apprentice, but legroom was too restricted for me and i had to leave. planning your timings for rides was the best thing. early pass allowed us to focus on the big rides and the disneyland app allowed us to see the real time wait times and move on to other rides. Thunder mountain went down several times, but being flexible was the best route. Allow for wet weather gear in the spring and whilst others were hiding we hit big rides with no wait times at all. we loved every minute, the kids went on almost every ride. if you don't like heights avoid tower rides but there is plenty to go and see. at 6ft 3 i could fit in every ride. tight on a couple but i was never unable to go on. walking across the park soon racks up walking distances. so good shoes are a must. Early passes in and staying late allowed us all to get extra rides. Can't wait to go back",Family Experience

"It‚Äôs a Disney park, so we all know what to expect. The rides were decent, albeit short. The character meets were wonderful. Plenty of access to food, drink and toilets. The parades were excellent as was the light and fireworks show at the end of the day. Staff throughout were brilliant and helpful.Now, onto some more negative thoughts.We stayed at the on-site Newport Bay Hotel which is a 10 minute walk to the park gates. This is mostly pleasant, alongside the lake which has Santa Fe and The Marvel hotels on it too. However, once past the lake you get rudely ushered through a tent with paramilitary-looking security people to scan/x-ray everything. I understand that security is important but surely there is a way of making this more in keeping with the Disney theme and less oppressive? Maybe dressed as Storm Troopers or something? Then through the Disney village into another ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù before finally being able to get through the park gates themselves.After dark the park is very dark, the lighting isn‚Äôt great. Golden Hour with the hotels is pretty much useless as the vast majority of rides are closed. It also seems that no one queues, personal space is a problem, and no one smokes quite like the French. Despite signage, the park is full of people walking round smoking and vaping.",Ride Experience

"It‚Äôs a Disney park, so we all know what to expect. The rides were decent, albeit short. The character meets were wonderful. Plenty of access to food, drink and toilets. The parades were excellent as was the light and fireworks show at the end of the day. Staff throughout were brilliant and helpful.Now, onto some more negative thoughts.We stayed at the on-site Newport Bay Hotel which is a 10 minute walk to the park gates. This is mostly pleasant, alongside the lake which has Santa Fe and The Marvel hotels on it too. However, once past the lake you get rudely ushered through a tent with paramilitary-looking security people to scan/x-ray everything. I understand that security is important but surely there is a way of making this more in keeping with the Disney theme and less oppressive? Maybe dressed as Storm Troopers or something? Then through the Disney village into another ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù before finally being able to get through the park gates themselves.After dark the park is very dark, the lighting isn‚Äôt great.

"Hugely overcrowded with massive queues for most rides (1 hour plus for 5 minute ride), made worse by those paying even more than most to jump the queue. Rides themselves were good once on. Parades were great. Light show great, fireworks  very late for children and seemed poor compared to 30 years ago when we last went. Few staff around the park to ask for directions. Accept that we went at peak time  but still far too many tickets sold for the capacity of the park. Rides frequently broke down, though mended quickly.  Many rides did not start till 9.30  so an early entry ticket at 8.30 did not help. the shows in the Studios  the highlight of the trip",Crowd Management

Very disappointed with how jame packed the park was. There was clearly no regard for reasonable capacity in this park. I've been to disney in California and it was way better. There are no timed tickets at this park so forget about being able to go on all the rides. We were there from 9:30-7:30 and were able to go on 6 rides and see 1 princess. The cue for the princess was 1.5 hours and you don't even get to know whay princess it is. Spent less than 5mins with her. Do not go for one day unless you pay the crazy fee for the skip the line pass. The rich get rewarded here.,Crowd Management

"An excellent family experience spent over three days in the park. A truly unique place, offering a wide range of activities and attractions.On the first day, we mostly didn‚Äôt use Premier Access for the rides. Queuing wasn‚Äôt too bad, but most waits were around 40 minutes, so we managed about one ride per hour. On the second day, we made extensive use of Premier Access, which made for a much more enjoyable day as we were able to experience everything. While it‚Äôs very expensive, purchasing individual access for rides turned out to be much cheaper than a general day pass. We used our final day to catch a couple of shows, both of which were brilliant.While the park certainly aims to maximise spending, it offers an experience unlike any other theme park. We found many of the rides to be quite unique‚Äînot only Disney-themed but also mechanically different. There‚Äôs a great use of cinematic effects on many attractions.We first visited when our children were 4 and 2, and nine years later we enjoyed a very different visit‚Äîmore rides, fewer princesses. The park caters brilliantly for all ages.",Family Experience

3 Days at Disneyland were perfect. Magic all over. The weather was fantastic and so all the waiting in lines was fine. We actually did the 90% of the activities in the 2 parks. If you have a good program and use the app will be very easy to not just wait in long lines for hours. All the rides where fantastic and full of excitement and thrill.

"Went to celebrate my daughters 30 th birthday whilst we stopped in Paris for a few days. To be honest wasn‚Äôt particularly looking forward to it but she wanted to go , so we did . We had the 2 park Pass and got on 5 rides in the time we were there. Never queued for more than 45 mins apart from the photos with Chip and Dale . We ate in the park and found the food good quality and very reasonable price wise .  Being October the park  was decked out for Halloween making it a little more special, giving you lots more photo opportunities.  The 5.00 pm parade was very entertaining being Halloween based , with the drone show adding a brilliant end to the day . These parks really bring out the child in you and we want to go again next time we are in Paris .",Family Experience

We ate in the park and found the food good quality and very reasonable price wise .  Being October the park  was decked out for Halloween making it a little more special, giving you lots more photo opportunities.  The 5.00 pm parade was very entertaining being Halloween based , with the drone show adding a brilliant end to the day . These parks really bring out the child in you and we want to go again next time we are in Paris .",Seasonal Events

"We visited Disneyland September, now I must admit it has never been a dream of mine to go here, but I am now converted.Booking was super easy, I booked about 6 months in advance and it allows you to make part payments.Arriving at the park by Eurostar train is super easy and then you just hop on a convenient bus to your hotel.Managing everything via the app is super easy and a must. The park is spectacular with so many things to see, do and eat.The staff are absolutely fantastic.",Planning Tips

"This was my 3rd time. Last time 2015, we were able to enter both Disneyland park and Disneyland Studio in 1 ticket. We got to watch many shows and enjoy fast passes. The parades were long and beautiful. Now we can only enter 1 park with 1 ticket. Shows were with additional charge and you have to buy the ticket for Disneystudios. Forget fast pass unless you pay extra for ""Premier Access."" We waited 1.15 hrs for 1 minute of Peterpan ride. This might be the last time I wasted my money here at Disneyland Paris. The good old Disney days are gone.",Ticket Pricing

"Second time returning to Eurodisney. We stayed in an apartment close to Eurodisney this time, rather than a Disney hotel as we wanted to get away and experience serris also. We travelled on the buses to and from the park. It was as usual very crowded and long queues during the daytime but when we returned for the evening it wasn't so crowded. The castles were lit up beautifully.  The daytime parade was spectacular. The illuminations and fireworks brilliant! Be prepared to be exhausted!",Crowd Management

"We spent the October School week at Disneyland Paris and stayed in the Cheyenne Hotel. There were 9 of us  and we were allocated 3 rooms next to each other, very close to the path that leads to the parks. The hotel was great. Staff were friendly and couldn't do enough for you. The rooms were large comfortable and cleaned every day. Before going I applied for a disabled Priority Pass and spoke to the concierge on my arrival at the hotel. After I presented the written evidence of my disability I was given the pass. This was a perfect for my trip. I was allowed to avoid the queues and could take up to 4 of my family with me. The staff in the parks were also brilliant and very helpful. Before going on this trip I was worried about how I would manage and with the pass and the help of my family and staff it was brilliant. We ate in several  places in the 2 parks and also in the Village as well as the Buffet at the hotel one evening. I cannot fault any of the places we ate at. The food was good, plentiful and freshly cooked and the staff were were always pleasant and helpful. My grandkids loved it, I am 70 and I loved it and can't wait to go back.",Staff Friendliness

"Overall, a very enjoyable stay.We are a family of four; with a 2 year old and 9 year old.We found the theme park to be really well presented with all of the Disney magic you could expect.The park was busy, but not too busy.We managed to get on most of the rides that we wanted to, and the rides with larger queues we waited until post 7pm, and then it was pretty early to get on.The electric show was great, so were the shows.What‚Äôs stopped the 5 stars, is the amount of people smoking, having visited the Orlando parks, I didn‚Äôt even realise Disney allowed smoking.Minor issues are people pushing in the queues, and there seemed to be phases during the day when quite a few rides were broken down.Overall, highly recommend",Family Experience

"Amazing experience, a must come place!However!!! Be aware of the employee Leane from the Dumbo Elephant carousel attraction. She was aggressively screaming at people, and considering the fact that there are mostly families with kids, it was completely unprofessional and created an unpleasant and unwelcoming atmosphere. A large group of people, my family included, was standing in the wrong waiting line because the guiding signs were obstructed from the view, so Leanne started screaming loudly with her high pinching voice that we must leave immediately because we don‚Äôt have any right to be in the priority line. When I tried to explain to her that the signs were not clear, and we were standing there already for 10 minutes waiting, she raised her voice even louder and aggressively kept pointing to the exit, so I grabbed my kids and rushed out just for them not to get scared of her behavior. We laughed at the situation, but it was a very strange feeling inside of me that something might be psychologically wrong with this employee.  Hoping to never see her again, we had to start over in another waiting line, because my kids really wanted to fly at the Dumbo Elephant. When our turn came 40 minutes later, Leanne was there again‚Ä¶ She was yelling again because she needed me to move in order to find a smaller group of people, but behind her yelling I misunderstood and I thought that she was telling us to hurry, so she yelled to my face that I can‚Äôt cross the turnstile and I have to wait where she points to. At this point I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore and I asked her to please speak respectfully without yelling, I mentioned that it‚Äôs the second time she‚Äôs unnecessary rude and that she creates a horrible atmosphere for the families and little kids especially. I had to say it loud because she kept yelling, and people around started to nod and say things how unprofessional and aggressive this girl is. When Leanne was yelling back to me, I just asked her to call the manager because it was truly unacceptable. Leanne‚Äôs excuse was that she has earphones in her ears so she‚Äôs forced to scream. But other employees at this attraction also had earphones, however they were nice and welcoming, and we felt their respectful attitude towards us and other guests. The manager apologized for Leanne‚Äôs behavior and this situation in general, but he insisted that she is a very good worker. I asked him to check the cameras, if there are any, and to judge the situation himself. I was very disappointed with this experience and I wished my kids didn‚Äôt have to encounter such a rude incompetent attendant who creates an aggressive atmosphere in the kids environment. I hope someone from the Dumbo Elephant carousel attraction will read my feedback and take into consideration.",Staff Friendliness

I had to say it loud because she kept yelling, and people around started to nod and say things how unprofessional and aggressive this girl is. When Leanne was yelling back to me, I just asked her to call the manager because it was truly unacceptable. Leanne‚Äôs excuse was that she has earphones in her ears so she‚Äôs forced to scream. But other employees at this attraction also had earphones, however they were nice and welcoming, and we felt their respectful attitude towards us and other guests. The manager apologized for Leanne‚Äôs behavior and this situation in general, but he insisted that she is a very good worker. I asked him to check the cameras, if there are any, and to judge the situation himself. I was very disappointed with this experience and I wished my kids didn‚Äôt have to encounter such a rude incompetent attendant who creates an aggressive atmosphere in the kids environment. I hope someone from the Dumbo Elephant carousel attraction will read my feedback and take into consideration.",Customer Service
"Revisited here after first visiting back in 1996. It's a good idea to download the Disney app as it gives you the times of parades, shows and queueing times of the attractions but found the app was a bit useless unless you had WiFi access. We visited here on a Monday outside the main school holidays but found it still to be as busy as if it were the peak times.The park is beautifully maintained as you'd expect from Disney but there are a number of building works going on and some of the rides were closed. There's still plenty of stuff for all ages to do and there were shows and parades which we missed because we wasted so much time queueing. Most of the rides were great with some quirky rides too and a few white knuckle ones which'll please the older kids.The highlight for me was the fantastic fireworks and drone show at the end of the night. We had to stand at the back of main street much of the area is closed off 30 minutes before the display starts. We spent almost 12 hours in the park walking just shy of 10 miles and were totally shattered by the end of the day. I would like to go back again in the future but my advice is give it a few years when Disney finish doing all of the building works.A tiring day, but great fun.",Planning Tips

"Overall:The trip had some extremely magical moments thanks to the hotel, the characters and some extras we got staying here. I booked directly through the Disneyland Paris website and it was a simple process and there were a number of options for paying. The Studios park, despite the ongoing works was great fun, and I‚Äôm excited to visit here in the future but the Disneyland park was a bit of a let down. The magic has seriously been lost in this park, between people queue jumping (I don‚Äôt mean priority pass but literally grown adults hoping barriers), shoving small children to the ground and miserable cast members, the experience didn‚Äôt live up to expectations (I‚Äôll explain more below). Overall however we had a great few days and we‚Äôre already planning our next Disney adventure (possibly a UK cruise ü§û). Day 1 - Travel and Hotel:I ordered the express luggage service through Disney which meant we could head straight to the park on arrival and do some attractions before our hotel was ready. I would recommend this for anyone who thinking of booking it. We met Darth Vader (shout out to cast member Fredric managing the queue here who was wonderful), and did a few extra . Great start to the trip! We headed over to our hotel, Hotel New York - Art of Marvel which is simply wonderful, from the artwork to the interior design, we loved the experience. That evening we had dinner in the Manhattan with wine included for me, which I thoroughly enjoyed, followed by drinks at the skyline bar and a trip to the kids club to draw some superhero‚Äôs. We loved the whole superhero‚Äôs in the city vibe everywhere in the hotel. Day 2 - Hotel Extras and Studios Park:The morning at the hotel we had breakfast delivered to our room, which came to ‚Ç¨24 for two of us so we could eat and get ready for the day at the same time. I wish in hindsight we did this more or got a meal plan because breakfast options aren‚Äôt great (or much cheeper) in the village. Our morning was taken up exploring the hotel and meeting Captain America at the superhero station before we headed off to the pool for a dip. The pool was warm, Jacuzzi was really nice and the sauna was lovely to relax. Only downside here is the depth of the pool which isn‚Äôt great if you‚Äôre not a strong swimmer (like me). My son loved it however because he can tread water, but there‚Äôs lots of floatation toys and free armbands if your little ones aren‚Äôt swimmers.  By midday we were strolling over to studios park and using the app to plan stops we managed all the ‚Äúbig rides‚Äù and the Pixar Show. A tip for Crush is to wait until the end of the day when people are heading over to the main park for the fireworks. We joined the queue at 7:30pm and were able to ride and still have time for another go of ratatouille before closing at 8pm. We loved the Studio park despite the work ongoing, the different worlds are beautifully designed here and can‚Äôt wait to see frozen / lion king. For dinner we ate at PYMs which is perfect for families and a big winner for any marvel fans, with lots of options for fussy eaters.Day 3 - Disneyland Park:We decided to grab something on the way to the park for breakfast and stopped at Starbucks which is fine but it lacked that magic we had in the hotel breakfast. It also came to ‚Ç¨18 so wasn‚Äôt a massive saving. As it was Halloween season the park was decorated but Frontierland was amazing. Probably our favourite area of the park. Fantasyland was looking very rundown and in desperate need of a paint and discoveryland is a bit off with the mix of Star Wars, Buzz and the Jules Verne vibe, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs been thrown together rather than thought out. Maybe it‚Äôll get updated after studios. Again I used the app as much as possible to do the rides, Peter Pan wasn‚Äôt open for magic hour so missed out here. I would recommend anyone thinking of it, just buy a priority pass for this ride, we queued for 1.5 hours. The app said 50 minutes but I don‚Äôt think it accounted for the number of people queue jumping. It seems in this park particularly the etiquette is that one member of the group will wait in line while others go about the park and come back to join the queue with the person waiting. Frustrating but not really Disney‚Äôs fault. All other rides we queued 5-20 minutes for because I used the app, which I think is pretty good and managed to get done everything we wanted including doing Pirates and Phantom Mannor twice. We skipped dinner today and instead wanted to try lots of the Halloween/Disney snacks but this was very hit or miss. Churos, burritos and a batwing doughnut in Frontierland were nice and suited the theming. The corn dog and popcorn from fantasyland was our favourite. Cafe Hyperion where they sell the Micky Halloween burger was atrocious. We waited 20 minutes to get served, the poor guy at the till kept getting up and going to the counter because the server couldn‚Äôt work fast enough for the orders coming though so he was trying to chip in and catch up the orders. When we did get our food and went to find a seat one cast member shouted at me for trying to sit at a 4 seat table when there were only two of us. She made us get up and follow her around the restaurant looking for a two seater table. People were looking and it felt very uncomfortable being paraded around when there was a number of empty tables. She then had to make us up a 2 seater space near the exit ramp which was even worse because prams and wheelchair users were blocked but she told us to sit and eat very abruptly. I just wanted to get out of there so badly so we quickly ate the burgers and left. There was no drone show on the evening which I expected because there had been poor weather all week and we didn‚Äôt see much of the fireworks either. The one thing that topped me over the edge in this park was a grown man pushing my son to the floor where he was seriously hurt, he is still bruised from how hard he was pushed and a number of people were annoyed along with me and were telling this man to apologies but he simply shrugged his shoulders and went about filming the fireworks. Cast members used to be dotted along main street and would stop pushing and shoving but this has died off which is a shame. I would recommend anyone with children try and buy a priority pass simply from a safety perspective. Day 4 - Last Day / Check out:We got up early and headed to the parks for a few last rides, as well as a trip to the dragon and meeting with Maleficent before heading back to the hotel at 10am. When we got back the hotel staff were already in the middle of changing the room so we had to get our cases and sort ourselves in the corridor. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for me because we were leaving but if people are waiting until the 11am check out this might be slightly annoying.All in all we really enjoyed, the hotel and extras were outstanding and anyone planning to stay at the hotel you will have an amazing time.",Magic Atmosphere

I would recommend anyone with children try and buy a priority pass simply from a safety perspective. Day 4 - Last Day / Check out:We got up early and headed to the parks for a few last rides, as well as a trip to the dragon and meeting with Maleficent before heading back to the hotel at 10am. When we got back the hotel staff were already in the middle of changing the room so we had to get our cases and sort ourselves in the corridor. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for me because we were leaving but if people are waiting until the 11am check out this might be slightly annoying.All in all we really enjoyed, the hotel and extras were outstanding and anyone planning to stay at the hotel you will have an amazing time.",Customer Service
"Overall:The trip had some extremely magical moments thanks to the hotel, the characters and some extras we got staying here. I booked directly through the Disneyland Paris website and it was a simple process and there were a number of options for paying. The Studios park, despite the ongoing works was great fun, and I‚Äôm excited to visit here in the future but the Disneyland park was a bit of a let down. The magic has seriously been lost in this park, between people queue jumping (I don‚Äôt mean priority pass but literally grown adults hoping barriers), shoving small children to the ground and miserable cast members, the experience didn‚Äôt live up to expectations (I‚Äôll explain more below). Overall however we had a great few days and we‚Äôre already planning our next Disney adventure (possibly a UK cruise ü§û). Day 1 - Travel and Hotel:I ordered the express luggage service through Disney which meant we could head straight to the park on arrival and do some attractions before our hotel was ready. I would recommend this for anyone who thinking of booking it. We met Darth Vader (shout out to cast member Fredric managing the queue here who was wonderful), and did a few extra . Great start to the trip! We headed over to our hotel, Hotel New York - Art of Marvel which is simply wonderful, from the artwork to the interior design, we loved the experience. That evening we had dinner in the Manhattan with wine included for me, which I thoroughly enjoyed, followed by drinks at the skyline bar and a trip to the kids club to draw some superhero‚Äôs. We loved the whole superhero‚Äôs in the city vibe everywhere in the hotel. Day 2 - Hotel Extras and Studios Park:The morning at the hotel we had breakfast delivered to our room, which came to ‚Ç¨24 for two of us so we could eat and get ready for the day at the same time. I wish in hindsight we did this more or got a meal plan because breakfast options aren‚Äôt great (or much cheeper) in the village. Our morning was taken up exploring the hotel and meeting Captain America at the superhero station before we headed off to the pool for a dip. The pool was warm, Jacuzzi was really nice and the sauna was lovely to relax. Only downside here is the depth of the pool which isn‚Äôt great if you‚Äôre not a strong swimmer (like me). My son loved it however because he can tread water, but there‚Äôs lots of floatation toys and free armbands if your little ones aren‚Äôt swimmers.  By midday we were strolling over to studios park and using the app to plan stops we managed all the ‚Äúbig rides‚Äù and the Pixar Show. A tip for Crush is to wait until the end of the day when people are heading over to the main park for the fireworks. We joined the queue at 7:30pm and were able to ride and still have time for another go of ratatouille before closing at 8pm. We loved the Studio park despite the work ongoing, the different worlds are beautifully designed here and can‚Äôt wait to see frozen / lion king. For dinner we ate at PYMs which is perfect for families and a big winner for any marvel fans, with lots of options for fussy eaters.Day 3 - Disneyland Park:We decided to grab something on the way to the park for breakfast and stopped at Starbucks which is fine but it lacked that magic we had in the hotel breakfast. It also came to ‚Ç¨18 so wasn‚Äôt a massive saving. As it was Halloween season the park was decorated but Frontierland was amazing. Probably our favourite area of the park. Fantasyland was looking very rundown and in desperate need of a paint and discoveryland is a bit off with the mix of Star Wars, Buzz and the Jules Verne vibe, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs been thrown together rather than thought out. Maybe it‚Äôll get updated after studios. Again I used the app as much as possible to do the rides, Peter Pan wasn‚Äôt open for magic hour so missed out here. I would recommend anyone thinking of it, just buy a priority pass for this ride, we queued for 1.5 hours. The app said 50 minutes but I don‚Äôt think it accounted for the number of people queue jumping. It seems in this park particularly the etiquette is that one member of the group will wait in line while others go about the park and come back to join the queue with the person waiting. Frustrating but not really Disney‚Äôs fault. All other rides we queued 5-20 minutes for because I used the app, which I think is pretty good and managed to get done everything we wanted including doing Pirates and Phantom Mannor twice. We skipped dinner today and instead wanted to try lots of the Halloween/Disney snacks but this was very hit or miss. Churos, burritos and a batwing doughnut in Frontierland were nice and suited the theming. The corn dog and popcorn from fantasyland was our favourite. Cafe Hyperion where they sell the Micky Halloween burger was atrocious. We waited 20 minutes to get served, the poor guy at the till kept getting up and going to the counter because the server couldn‚Äôt work fast enough for the orders coming though so he was trying to chip in and catch up the orders. When we did get our food and went to find a seat one cast member shouted at me for trying to sit at a 4 seat table when there were only two of us. She made us get up and follow her around the restaurant looking for a two seater table. People were looking and it felt very uncomfortable being paraded around when there was a number of empty tables. She then had to make us up a 2 seater space near the exit ramp which was even worse because prams and wheelchair users were blocked but she told us to sit and eat very abruptly. I just wanted to get out of there so badly so we quickly ate the burgers and left. There was no drone show on the evening which I expected because there had been poor weather all week and we didn‚Äôt see much of the fireworks either. The one thing that topped me over the edge in this park was a grown man pushing my son to the floor where he was seriously hurt, he is still bruised from how hard he was pushed and a number of people were annoyed along with me and were telling this man to apologies but he simply shrugged his shoulders and went about filming the fireworks.

"Visited for the 1st time, two adults & two teenage boys.  We arrived half an hour before the park opened & got to the front of the ques for it opening. We went at it all day only stopping for food & left at the fireworks at the end. We managed to see all the parades, do most of the rides & attractions apart from a few small ones.  I have been to Florida & yes, as a comparison this doesn't have all the attractions Florida does, but it's pretty much the same as the Magic Kingdom! Remember it's not 'Disneyworld', it's 'Disneyland'. It's a brilliant day out, has something for everyone & is still a great Disney park! Wear comfy trainers, get a good sleep the night before & be prepared to be tired out if you're going to try get round everything in one day!",Family Experience

"Just returned from our first every trip to Disneyland  Paris and cant wait to go back.  The Pixar and Mickey the Magician shows are just outstanding.  I went to both twice over two days and would have went again if we hadn't run out of time.  Even the storm on our first day didn't ruin our trip although it rained heavily for the entire day.  Our teenagers aged 16 and 13 loved it. Make sure to have ponchos and silicone shoe covers or wellies for the little ones to keep dry.  Its a long day and being wet from head to toe isn't ideal.  We purchased our park tickets direct and were surprised not to be allowed to change the dates in advance when a storm was forecast.  My husband had a major spinal surgery in January and only just received a letter from the surgeon the day before our trip which didn't allow us to go through the proper channel to get a pass .  The letter unfortunately didn't suffice at customer service so we had to buy fast passes as he could not stand in the queues.    I would recommend if buying this to be prepared that the 90 euro per day for the pass as shown on the app is from 90 euros and in fact was 120 euros per pass.  Also you can only use it once on each ride.  I would also advise you get the digital pass and a printed pass as you can loose signal in the park.  One thing that surprised me was the food situation.  I had read really bad reviews but we had a great food experience in the Rainforest Cafe.  We also stumbled across Toad Hall based in Fantasyland.  With its  beautiful stone exterior and old world charm interior it had the best fish and chips we have had in years, newspaper and all !!  Highly recommend.  I had read about rides closing without notice etc and that is unfortunately the case,  they can be closed for many hours.  Hopefully its a safety issue and not a staffing issue as the later would not be acceptable.Unfortunately due to the storm on our first day we only got to catch the light show on the second night.  The crowds are daunting however it was beautiful.  Renovation works aside the gardens and planting are just beautiful as are the little shops.  I would love to return in both summer and at Christmas over the next few years.  We had stayed in Centreparcs which is one of the Disney hotels.  I would heavily recommend you avoid this accommodation.  Having walked Disneyland for 12 hours the last thing you want to do is get a bus back only to walk another 15 minutes through a pitch black forest to your very basic bordering on unclean accommodation. The lighting situation is disgraceful I don't know how they are getting away with it.  Trying to get up and get breakfast sorted to get out early to the park is a rush.  When going again I will definitely stay in a hotel  close by. Roll on the next visit !",Event Experiences

I would recommend if buying this to be prepared that the 90 euro per day for the pass as shown on the app is from 90 euros and in fact was 120 euros per pass.  Also you can only use it once on each ride.  I would also advise you get the digital pass and a printed pass as you can loose signal in the park.  One thing that surprised me was the food situation.  I had read really bad reviews but we had a great food experience in the Rainforest Cafe.  We also stumbled across Toad Hall based in Fantasyland.  With its  beautiful stone exterior and old world charm interior it had the best fish and chips we have had in years, newspaper and all !!  Highly recommend.  I had read about rides closing without notice etc and that is unfortunately the case,  they can be closed for many hours.  Hopefully its a safety issue and not a staffing issue as the later would not be acceptable.Unfortunately due to the storm on our first day we only got to catch the light show on the second night.  The crowds are daunting however it was beautiful.  Renovation works aside the gardens and planting are just beautiful as are the little shops.  I would love to return in both summer and at Christmas over the next few years.  We had stayed in Centreparcs which is one of the Disney hotels.  I would heavily recommend you avoid this accommodation.  Having walked Disneyland for 12 hours the last thing you want to do is get a bus back only to walk another 15 minutes through a pitch black forest to your very basic bordering on unclean accommodation. The lighting situation is disgraceful I don't know how they are getting away with it.  Trying to get up and get breakfast sorted to get out early to the park is a rush.

"Disneyland was as magical as you‚Äôd expect. We went with the knowledge that we‚Äôd need to prepare to queue and that there would be crowds of people. So it wasn‚Äôt a shock to have to wait 30 - 60 minutes for some rides and weave in and out the people. All staff members were friendly and helpful. If, like me, you didn‚Äôt take any paracetamol, just ask for directions to the first aid room and they‚Äôll issue some after taking a few details and your temperature. The illuminations and fireworks show is great. Expect people to be a bit push/shove and kids will go on their parents shoulders - which I understand as there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd see otherwise. My advice would be, be assertive. Just like kids, if you give an inch, they‚Äôll take a mile - almost literally when watching the end of evening show. Overall, I‚Äôd be delighted to return and enjoy some of the attractions we missed.",Magic Atmosphere

"We had a nice time here, enjoyed the park and the fireworks show. Managed to get on a few rides and saw some characters, plus it was lovely to see the Halloween decorations and parade. All of the Cast Members we came across were wonderful and friendly, they are always willing to help!The low rating is to do with the amount of work going on in the park itself, construction walls great you in nearly every land. Yes, the park desperately needs the work as it is starting to look very tired but there must be ways to do all this work without impacting the guest experience. While we managed to meet a few characters, we felt slightly disappointed with the amount and length of time they were in the park. After having brilliant character experience in the Tokyo Disney Parks in 2023, it felt very lacking in Paris. The other main issue we had was the crowds for the firework show at the end of the day. The crowd was so dense that we waited until the hoards of people dispersed so that we could safely exit the park. In general, the crowd control was not Tokyo Disney standards but has gotten better over the years here. One thing that I want to warn others about is not a Disney problem but a human problem is the amount of selfish, self centred guests that are in the park. Not only rude to other guests but to the Cast Members as well. I found that these rude guests ruined the magic more than anything else. Also, on our last day, we were unable to reenter the park with our Magic Pass despite paying for the 3 nights/4 park days package through Disney. Luckily, a Cast Member let us back into Disneyland Parc with no problems but we found it quite embarrassing and annoying. Would we go back? Yes! We always enjoy our time in Disney, it is a nice escape from reality that is needed!",Magic Atmosphere

"I‚Äôve been before but this time was very disappointed, many rides were closed, we had early morning passes because we stayed in the new port hotel, which was lovely, but when we entered the park at 8.30 for our hour privilege only one ride was open, flying rockets, all the rest didn‚Äôt open until 9.30 so was a complete waste of time getting up early, we had a booking to have lunch with the princesses, which cost extra money, when we got to our reservation they had put me and my husband in a different restaurant to my daughter and grandchildren, after a lot of waiting and checking our passes over and over they put us all on a table in a cove separate from the main restaurant, by which time many of the princesses had disappeared, my granddaughter was pleased with the ones she got to see but it was meant to be a treat and turned into a disaster, several of the old rides could do with an overhaul, I went 20 years ago and nothing had changed except bits missing from rides due to usage over time, in the Alice labyrinth the metal caterpillar on the mushroom obviously corroded over time and fell off, and never bothered to replace, lots of construction going on, boarding everywhere which spoils the overall magic, along with rides not working like great thunder mountain, cars breaking down on the car track repeatedly and although the hotel was lovely the swimming pool was shut, so when we got torrential rain there was very little to do, for the amount it cost us we could have gone and stayed for a couple of weeks abroad full board , but wanted to go somewhere for our grandchildren, they had a good time but it should have been magical as promised",Attraction Availability

"No where near as good as Florida. Barely any good rides THAT ARE OPEN, especially in Marvel studios. Saw this random fight show thing that's half english half french, so I couldn't tell you what on earth was going on. I highly recommend the Avengers ride though. (THEN LEAVE) Disneyland itself was slightly better. But it was  VERY busy. Its a small world is my favourite and we went on it, but the boats are so close it doesn't feel like a boat ride, just a continual snake-like conveyor belt that goes round and round. And when we wanted to go again at only 6, we go and it says ""closed but back in 5 mimutes"" SO WE WAIT. AND WAIT. AND WAIT. an hour later ITS STILL CLOSED!!!There was big thunder mountain that was pretty good as well. There was building work so the map wasn't accurate and 2we got lost multiple times.BUT THE WORST PART WAS THE FOOD.we had a food voucher that you can only use in like 6 restaurants. It was only 5pm, but it said lots of them were closed. finally we find  one on the app THATS OPEN, so we walk all the way across the park to get to it in the rain, but guess what? ITS CLOSEDü§ØThen at 7pm we find a pizza place; but with the voucher you can only get like 2 things. I got the pizza, and after a MASSIVE QUEUE, it came and we had nowhere to sit.

"Goodness, this is a tough one! I LOVE Disney, and the last time I visited Paris was 2019, so it‚Äôs been awhile! DLP has a lot of sentimental and nostalgic value to me, but even I couldn‚Äôt ignore how downhill this place seems to have gone‚Ä¶I just feel like they need to spend some major money on improving the Disneyland Park, it‚Äôs so outdated now it‚Äôs almost laughable: the rides are so old-fashioned and janky, I find it hard to believe that anyone is finding them impressive these days, particularly ones like Phantom Manor and Pirates of the Caribbean with their decrepit animatronics: both classic rides with stories I love, but not fit for 2024 onwards, especially with the price tag of a Disney ticket. The parade was the same one from back in 2019 but missing several floats/dance units, very disappointing and difficult to view as it was so busy in the park! The Halloween cavalcade is one I love, but again difficult to view as it was so busy! We barely saw any characters out and about, which again was very disappointing, it honestly felt like an average run of the mill theme park rather than a magical Disney experience‚Ä¶To top it off, after we waited over an hour for the nighttime shows, in huge crowds, 5 minutes before starting they announced there would be no drone show - so disappointing as that‚Äôs the main reason we stayed! No contingency in place, it really felt like they‚Äôre riding on their profits knowing people will return time and time again, without putting in any effort to make it special anymore.Even the merch has gone downhill, the quality of products is terrible, and the range to choose from is nothing special, nothing sentimental about it - you can genuinely get nicer things from Asda or Primark these days for less than a quarter of the price!Overall a disappointment, which is such a shame as it has the potential to be incredible!",Attraction Availability

"I was expecting a stress-free magical day given we had spent ¬£600 on tickets for a family of 4 for 2 days. Wasn't the case unfortunately. I can definitely see some evidence of where the money goes; the parks are not run down at all, very well maintained and clean. I'd imagine the daily parade and closing ceremonies are expensive to hold, and the Pixar show was absolutely fantastic. But unfortunately it was difficult to really enjoy many of the things our tickets had paid for due to the sheer amount of people they allow into the parks. At the parade and closing ceremony you have to literally fight for somewhere to stand! There just isn't enough open space for each person to stand which is a bit outrageous given both are outside, open-air activities and there should be ample room! Now I know why they try to sell you extra tickets for a VIP viewing platform for these displays. Shouldn't be needed at all! Imagine my shock when I look at a crowd calendar website online which shows the park was actually only half full when we went! What volume of people are they letting in when its close to 100% capacity?! Which brings me onto my biggest gripe, fast passes. of course they are given a fancy name (Premier Access) but is a clever way of legitimising pushing-in. Don't get me wrong, I am aware most theme parks have rolled out this morally defunct concept but its so much worse at Disneyland due to the fact you're paying 2-3x as much and should be treated like Royalty with a standard pass! To have queued for almost an hour with small, stressed, bored children to have someone sashay past you and walk right onto the ride is a slap in the face given I've saved all year for this trip. There will be people reading this thinking ""Well, they've paid for the privilege"". Yes, they've paid Disney not me or anyone else in the queue. There are rude practices that go against human nature that money can't buy your way out of, and one of those is pushing in. Long queues is an issue that Disney has created by allowing too many people into the park and they are also the ones profiting from it.On the plus side, the rides themselves were very enjoyable and magical (if not a bit short, e.g. the Peter Pan ride). And the restaurants were amazing, especially the Agrabah Cafe. Unlike some more expensive restaurants it is all-you-can-eat so don't need to worry about getting ripped off with portion sizes.One last tip: shop around for park entrance tickets. Strangely, it is often more expensive to book direct with Disney. We got ours through Expedia and had no issues",Park Cleanliness

I'd imagine the daily parade and closing ceremonies are expensive to hold, and the Pixar show was absolutely fantastic. But unfortunately it was difficult to really enjoy many of the things our tickets had paid for due to the sheer amount of people they allow into the parks. At the parade and closing ceremony you have to literally fight for somewhere to stand! There just isn't enough open space for each person to stand which is a bit outrageous given both are outside, open-air activities and there should be ample room! Now I know why they try to sell you extra tickets for a VIP viewing platform for these displays. Shouldn't be needed at all! Imagine my shock when I look at a crowd calendar website online which shows the park was actually only half full when we went! What volume of people are they letting in when its close to 100% capacity?! Which brings me onto my biggest gripe, fast passes. of course they are given a fancy name (Premier Access) but is a clever way of legitimising pushing-in. Don't get me wrong, I am aware most theme parks have rolled out this morally defunct concept but its so much worse at Disneyland due to the fact you're paying 2-3x as much and should be treated like Royalty with a standard pass! To have queued for almost an hour with small, stressed, bored children to have someone sashay past you and walk right onto the ride is a slap in the face given I've saved all year for this trip. There will be people reading this thinking ""Well, they've paid for the privilege"". Yes, they've paid Disney not me or anyone else in the queue. There are rude practices that go against human nature that money can't buy your way out of, and one of those is pushing in. Long queues is an issue that Disney has created by allowing too many people into the park and they are also the ones profiting from it.On the plus side, the rides themselves were very enjoyable and magical (if not a bit short, e.g. the Peter Pan ride). And the restaurants were amazing, especially the Agrabah Cafe. Unlike some more expensive restaurants it is all-you-can-eat so don't need to worry about getting ripped off with portion sizes.One last tip: shop around for park entrance tickets.

"The first and most important point I wish to make is about Marie.  Marie checked us into our room at the Art of Marvel.  Marie was absolutely outstanding and I was beyond completely satisfied with all that she did for us.  Although we had arrived slightly early, Marie was able to have the room ready for us by the time we had checked in at reception.  Marie had additional decaf coffee delivered to the room as my mother drinks a lot of decaf coffee, additional water, and bathrobes, with slippers.  Marie was extremely professional but equally kind and considerate.  All questions that we had for her were completely answered.  The room itself was wonderful.  We had a great view, it was very clean and tidy.  I used the fitness room and pool everyday and these were both a great experience.  The gym was a good size but could benefit with additional equipment as the strength equipment was very limited.  I would also recommend an antibacterial spray and tissues so that the gym equipment could be wiped down after use.  The pool was great and I would go in the morning as it opened so that I could enjoy the calm atmosphere with very few people there.  The boutique, I felt was very limited in stock.  The restaurants for breakfast were perfect as it was never full and there was a great selection of food.  The only complaint that I have is the Skyline bar.  We  went there on October 1st, in the afternoon when it was quiet, maybe 6 or 7 people there, and ordered 3 cocktails.  It took over 30 minutes for them to be prepared and served.  This seemed to be inadequate.  The coffee was also ridiculously expensive too, 5.50 euros was far too expensive.  All in all, the experience was amazing and I would definitely consider staying there again in the future.  Walt's restaurant was a highlight also, the food was great but the service was outstanding and Lucie, our server, was extremely professional.  Lucie was friendly, courteous, and unintrusive.  Lucie was able to , against all odds, seat us at a window table so that we were able to enjoy the parade.",Customer Service

"I was extremely disappointed with the Disneyland Paris experience. Our daughter is only 3 and all she wanted was to meet Minie, we stood in line for 30minutes before being informed that Minie would leave before we reach her and that the line is closed. It was her last ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of the day which meant that the trip was a bit of waste.This combined with the expected commercialisation of the park left us with a poorer opinion of the entire franchise.

Our daughter is only 3 and all she wanted was to meet Minie, we stood in line for 30minutes before being informed that Minie would leave before we reach her and that the line is closed. It was her last ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of the day which meant that the trip was a bit of waste.This combined with the expected commercialisation of the park left us with a poorer opinion of the entire franchise.

"It has 3 areas; Disneyland main theme park, hollywood studios, and Disney Village. They are all closely linked together all in walking distance of one another. It is in close walking distance to the bus station and train station too. The hollywood studios and Disney Village is undergoing a number of refurbishments which makes their visits short. The main park youll definately need at least a day to see it all. Most the rides allow small children to ride attractions, even the scarier attractions such as pirates of the carribean, and phantom mansion is fine for 1 yr olds to ride too. The queues during September were around 10-30min but seeing a character took longer. We found it easier to eat in Disney village than in the park, although we did eat in Gephettos which was good value and did great portions too. I saw some families take their own food in- it is more relaxed not so strict in Disneyland Paris as Magic Kingdom, even has ppl walking around smoking. We had an enjoyable visit and hope to make another trip someday.",Attraction Availability

"Have been to Disney parks in California, Florida -and Paris a couple of times.On this occasion came with family to celebrate a family occasion.Must say that my experience was that DLP was okay but didn‚Äôt feel the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù that have previously experienced on the past due to a number of reasons:Smoking-although‚Äùbanned‚Äù in the parks (except for specific areas) people were freely smoking and vaping around children . Staff did nothing to stop this.Long, long queues-appreciate is necessary on some rides but  2 1/2 hours to meet the Disney princesses is excessive. Most rides were 40 to 50 minutes wait ‚Äì This must be butthis must be French time because it certainly took a lot longer than that to get to the actual ride once we‚Äôd started queueing.Poor maintenance- Tripped over paving stones on several occasions that were uneven. Walking up to the castle, there was no mortar in the joints in the surrounding wall over the moat!! In several areas, things are appreciably worn and although maintenance is ongoing, It felt that some TLC was needed generally.Hoarding boards everywhere! ‚Äì Lots of areas are under construction/refurbishment which gave the feel of being in a building siteFood queues- Staff had no sense of urgency in trying to serve .

It was pointed out to them that surely they could, carry on serving others whilst this operation was completed. They did this begrudgingly!

Staff were so slow, chatting to each other and seemingly oblivious to the queue of people which was stretching right out of the door.

"I consider myself a Disney Fan and I have been to Disney World many times and Disneyland once.  I had the opportunity to visit Disneyland Paris on a whim while being in close proximity.  I figured I'd drop in and check it out.  All I can say is ""Has Bob Iger visited this park lately""?  Upon entry  I noted a lot of people just casually smoking anywhere and everywhere they wanted.  Of course, this is not permitted in the USA and I can't believe that they would allow this.  Upon entering the washroom there was no soap in the soap dispenser and the bathroom looked dirty-- many stalls clogged with toilet paper and out of order.    As we entered Frontierland, again multitudes of people just having a casual ciggy and cast members just looking the other way.  We went to Coco's for lunch which was just okay.  Of note, the lighting in the cue for the pirates is so dim you can't see anything in front of you which is a risk that certainly would not pass standard in the US parks.  There is potential for this park in that some of the rides were longer and more intense than their counterparts in the USA, but the magic was lost on cast members who wore their sunglasses on the top of their heads and leaned against the wall and just really looked like they didn't want to be there.  Actually one encounter at a churro stand the cast members were just rude as they counted their change.  Small World - again lots of people just smoking a ciggy in the cue.  The water in the attraction had coins that people had thrown into the water - probably 20 years ago that were rusting at the bottom along with ciggy butts and dirt (magic is lost).  Where is the attention to detail?  You would not see this in the USA parks.  Shout out to the cast members at tower of terror who were in character and made the ride a great experience.  We wanted to find a place to eat and so decided on Colonel Hathi's which was supposed to serve Indian food.  I ordered "" Pakora"" which was definitely not pakora.  It was a dried up cold ball of what looked to be a falafel that was dried out and gross.  What was supposed to be raita was actually mayo.  Lets talk about the ""butter chicken"" and the ""dahl"".  The so called ""dahl"" was hard and chewy and the butter chicken was watered down.  They obviously buy a sauce and then water it down.  It was terrible.  In the washroom at this place, somebody had thrown a sanitary napkin into the toilet and the peeling paper as well.  On the whole, the washrooms in Disneyland Paris were not attended to and very dirty.So to try and be positive a little bit....I can say that the lines were not long and we never waited longer than 20 minutes but on the whole it is a sad and sorry park and I would say save your money and go to Disney World in Florida or Disneyland in California.

"Have been to Disney a number of times over the years here and in the states I can safely say none of the parks are as good as what they were 10 years ago  .  Yes you do stumble across that disney feeling and sparkle but more and more like the last visits to Orlando and here . There's more rides broken down more people In the park , less sparkle higher and higher costs. Is it worth it anymore ? Probably not.  Value for money there are so many better options now . Would we go again . Maybe but not for a long long time",Ticket Pricing
I went to Disneyland Paris with my sons for my birthday we got first class tickets on the Eurostar straight to Disney I went for the fireworks night many years ago it was ABSOLUTELY brilliant we stayed in the hotel sequoia lodge and we really enjoyed it my older two sons loved the rides the smaller ones and my youngest was too young for the rides. we dined in planet Hollywood and rainforest cafe my sons absolutely loved it. On fireworks night the fireworks were absolutely breathtaking they did the last fireworks to show the Micky mouse in fireworks it really was truly amazing.I would love to take my youngest again now he is older with his brothers I would definatly recommend it.,Food Quality
"It is a funny old place. I am sure some will love it. For others it won't appeal. I have to admit that I didn't expect to go wild over it but I was slightly disappointed. Possibly because I had incorrect expectations. I was accompanying a group of teenage schoolchildren. I think they had a great time but my honest view is that the place is geared to a younger age-group. That might cloud my judgment in this review! I did, however,  think the parades and shows were impressive but they weren't what I was seeking most. It was the rides that disappointed me. If you are looking for white-knuckle rides, Disneyland is not the place to go. If you are desiring an (expensive) day out with your young children, you may be more satisfied.Restaurants are expensive in my view for not very much food. Gardens and flowers are beautiful. Entry and exit into the main concourse is pretty straightforward but inside it is very crowded, but I accept that we were there in high summer.I am glad I went and I did quite enjoy my day but I am in no hurry to return.One final point of commendation. I was queuing for the hyperspace mountain (decent but not exceptional) when I realised my phone was missing. I worked out where I was most likely to have lost it which turned out to be true because they had my phone present and correct for collection. I don't know who picked it up but it was good to experience some honesty and to know they have an efficient system for lost property. That was a positive experience for me.",Food Quality

"Disney is always great with children, and without, however this is probably one of the worst parks. Yes it has great things to do, but you can see some attractions outdated and old (Pinocchio,  dumbo, peter pan, ....) you wait 1h for a 2 mins walk on something that feels like you've seen it at any travelers fair.  Compared with other Disney parks where you get better entertainment during waiting times (not to mention you wait under the sun with barely no shades ), or more modern attractions... some waits are not worth The food is a different topic, nice restaurants (some expensive but ok you see the princesses)  , but grab a sandwich is just bad, that pretzel bread, and barely filled,  just avoid it, eat outside.I'm not sure if it is because part of staff is French but in general, big smile bad attitude and rude, i thought the unspoken rule of not breaking a hug with children was real... well it is not, if you are on a queue to have a picture with some one and then time's up, the close the place, right in your face, come back tomorrow we were told (and we were the only ones/last ones waiting).MMerchandising is very limited, no movies, books, comics, same stuff everywhere, starwars and marvel is just anecdotal. In general, I'd recommend save a little bit more, get a flight offer to Orlando and go there, 3-4 days might cost the same (prices there are cheaper) than at Disney, better attractions, better food, better weather, way friendlier staff.",Attraction Availability

In general, I'd recommend save a little bit more, get a flight offer to Orlando and go there, 3-4 days might cost the same (prices there are cheaper) than at Disney, better attractions, better food, better weather, way friendlier staff.",Food Quality

"Disneyland Paris, the most magical and happy place on Earth. Or so we thought. This Tuesday outside of the holiday season, you would expect some quietness in Disneyland, but it was such busy that most paths were not walkable. However we tried looking through this and enjoy. We got a priority pass because we had a ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù (autism). With the idea that he did not need to stand in the queues and enjoy too the ‚Äúmost magical place on Earth‚Äù.To our deep sorrow and fright, it was chaos in the queues. One has to enter at the exit or premium gates at the attractions, but not only disabled use this, as well the ‚Äúrich premium people‚Äù who paid money to have a quick entrance. This is horrific because especially autistic people have trouble standing in queues/lines, therefore they have the disability pass to skip them and let them enjoy too. These people just bumped against him like he wasn‚Äôt there, and even the lines were much shorter, there were huge lines due to these ‚Äúrich premium people‚Äù.Also the Disney employees who are supposed to be happy and make people smile and appreciated, especially disabled, didn‚Äôt smile at all, were sometimes rude, uninterested/cold, tired and had poor English language skill. There were some exceptions of employees, one which was exactly how it was supposed to be. He took us personally all the way to the front, making sure nobody bumped against us (the people who were exiting). He took care with passion and love. He was sadly a rarity in general.We ate at a ranch restaurant, where we paid ‚Ç¨108 in total. The menu choice was poor and the portions incredible small. I wasn‚Äôt satisfied and felt hungry afterwards. The weirdest thing was uneatable desert, it was popcorn, vanilla tofu, jam and blue berries, it was horrendous.The worst of the day, which ruined all completely, was the sudden closure of parts of Disneyland around 19:45-20:00, this resulted into chaos, people were forced into a single direction and only one road was open, it felt like you had to walk the entire park through to get anywhere near the Castle of Sleeping Beauty for the fireworks/lightshow. For people with autism this is disaster, and feels like the disabled are left on their own and not taken into account.For the parade there is a section for the disabled, but as well here, the absolute ridiculous thing is that it is the same spot where the premium people are put. Resulting in a crowded place full of people, the disabled (also lower wheelchairs) not seeing anything because these people are in front, and the autistic are getting overstimulated. There is as-well no place to sit and you have to stand almost 1 hour.Disney employees are pointing with their flashlight sticks in your face, why can‚Äôt they normally warmly speak to you, to hive you at least some magic feeling.The show was somehow okeyish, the lights on the castle are beautiful, as is the projection. The show is long. The drones didn‚Äôt happen because it was bas weather. A pity but well not someone can do much about.When the show ended, it was only announced in French. A million people rushed for the exit I was crushed against a fence, and the only place to escape to was a security entrance gate (which is an entrance to go into the park) and I asked them kindly and with urge if we could exit through it (there was nobody, and the station was next to it) and the man first ignored us (and our disabled child) and than said rudely we have to go back into the crowd, he pushed us. I said we have a child with autism. He just laughed and pushed us back in the crowd. Unbelievable this is the way a Disney employee treated a disabled person (and his family).We didn‚Äôt see any Disney characters the entire day, we looked for them, but there were zero.All with all, a horrific day that has been remembered by our family as the worst day in the ‚Äúhappiest place on Earth.Please avoid at all costs",Crowd Management

Our most visited and exciting park was Hollywood Studios with Galaxy‚Äôs Edge as Star Wars fans. The Blackspire Outpost and it's Rides represent a peak of Man's ideas and techniques of realising science fiction!  Thanks to George Lucas and Disney. The new Lightning Lane system is a perfect invention that people who are willing to pay extra get all their rides they want at the time they prefer in their holidays. It's better than the fast-pass years ago and I don't want to mention the awful Genie system. The Dining Plan with snacks, Quick Lunch and just one Table Service is not bad but there should be a rethinking if guests want table service only and pay for it.The shops were less than five years ago and there were less shops with for example jewelery or crystal figures.

We returned from there after a five night stay in January 2025 realizing the magic is gone and the Disney brand has fallen far indeed.  The customer service was abysmal.  Cast members were rude, unhelpful, openly on cell phones and completely disregarding guests in lines, discussing their conflicts with their bosses in the gift shops, complaining of short staffing, and the list goes on.  When we returned, I reached out to them by phone.  Was told I had to email complaints.  I emailed and was dismissed and told that they were glad we managed to find two positive experiences in the midst of the experience and hoped we would return.

"I recently had a disappointing experience with Disney that has left me frustrated and dissatisfied. In January 2025, I purchased a $100 shirt at Disney World Park in Florida, but when I got home, I realized it was the wrong size. I tried to return or exchange the shirt for a different size but was informed that it was no longer eligible for a return or exchange despite the recent purchase.Being unable to swap a simple item like a shirt, especially when the purchase was made within weeks, is I expected better customer service and more reasonable return policies for a company of Disney's stature, especially given the premium prices they charge for merchandise. Not being able to swap a simple item like a shirt, especially when the purchase was made within weeks, is really disappointing. It‚Äôs a shame that Disney doesn't seem to prioritize customer satisfaction in the same way it does its entertainment and theme parks. I won‚Äôt be rushing to buy more merchandise anytime soon. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars at the Parks, the Channel, and more. Never again! This is disturbing",Customer Service

"We celebrated my daughters 12th birthday at Disney. We did Magic Kingdom which was amazing and had a very classic vibe, loved space mountain, the classic castle. Our ultimate favorites were Disney Studios because of the epic Star Wars area. OMG!!! If you want everything Star Wars that is the park for you. My daughter made her very own droid!! What an experience that was, we had drinks at the Cantina and even did the smugglers run in the Falcon! Next was the Animal Kingdom, let me tell you I was super emotional when I saw Pandora, they brought the movie to life. My daughter built her own Avatar on her Birthday. They really do it special. We did the epic ride on Avatar Flight of the passage, you feel like you are really riding on Na'vi, I balled my eyes out it was so real. Highly recommend and the Na'Vi river journey. Such an amazing experience. If you are leaving from Canada and you can go through AMA travel, do it!",Event Experiences

Experience was great! The only thing was I wish the fast passes were a bit better. You have to reserve a fast past spot and you cant reserve anything else until you are past that time. I don't know if it was becuase we were just coming back from universal with fast passes when we could go whenever we want but just don't buy the fast passes there not worth it my best part about this trip is Epcot. It was so fun we were there for new years eve( I know it says March 2024 that's the earliest I could go in my review but we went December 2023-January 2024) and I loved the fireworks!,Attraction Availability

When you experience the delays beyond the lines for rides you will never go back. Disney operations are behind the times and they could not care less. Security guards are inexperienced and have a hard time operating the old and outdated magnetometers for the tram to get from place to place. Long lines and rude guards cause constant arguments in front of kids. Not good for the Disney future and apparently the result of typical apathy by management that have given up. Buses are constantly late and behind schedules. These delays lead to missed rides and entertainment. Kids get frustrated. Old buses and unchecked traffic lights cause these problems. Again a problem from overpaid yet incompetent corporate executives. Consider other options or get ready to get upset,Staff Friendliness

"Very nice resort. However, it is outragously expensive! It's hard to find a decent priced vacation for 4 adults and 2 teens under $3000.I'd like to add that I booked Universal Studios for 2 teens and 4 adults, 2 volcano bay resort view rooms, for 7 days with photo package and 4 day parks for only $2800. However, Disney wanted to limit my resort choices and charge me over  $5000 for a standard room for 5 days and 1 park day. We will have to consider Universal until Disney has better deals.

It has taken many hours to ensure all is ok.Now, I escalated to supervisor who shared all my LIGHTENING LANE RESERVATIONS could be CANCELED.

"Here is the formal complaint that I have just sent through to guest services for which I am still awaiting a response.....It fills me with great sadness that I find myself writing this formal complaint directed at a company that I had come to believe were inclusive and the most welcoming towards children, particularly those with disabilitiesWe had booked what was supposed to be the holiday of a lifetime with 7 members of my family who had travelled from the UK and Canada to spend the holiday period in Orlando Dec 2024. Prior to our departure, I had done as much research as I could with regards to how Disney in Florida could account for my sons additional needs who is medically extremely complex with both physical and cognitive disabilities. I had reached out to various departments of yours to advise that all links associated with your disability access service were not working when browsing from the UK and I was told that I could do nothing in advance to get arrangements in place and simply had to visit guest services on the day of our arrival to make the necessary arrangementsOther than thinking, we may lose a little time through queuing at guest services, I suppose I was ok with this and thought nothing more of it.Upon arrival at the magic kingdom on our first day, we were greeted with a queue of around an hour and once speaking to guest services, I was told they would need to arrange a virtual consultation via zoom to establish the support/accomodations that could be provided for my son. It was at this point that things started to go very wrong. An interview was conducted with myself and both my son that appeared to focus on why my son could not queue for an extended period of time; I went on to explain why this was physically not possible for my son due to his cerebral palsy and why cognitively this would not be possible as my son does not really understand the concept of queuing and would get upset which could lead to anger and aggression.The individual that I was speaking to on the phone quite simply infuriated me. After stating that the DAS would not be appropriate for my son I challenged him and asked him how he could make such a judgement based on a short virtual consultation and asked him how he has was qualified to make a decision about physically disabilities when he himself stated he was a phycologist. DAS was rejected and no other accommodations offered were suitable.I was simply referred back to guest services whom I continued the conversation with in person.After being told that there was no one in guest services that could overturn the decision or discuss the specifics of further, I asked to speak to a manager whom although, very understanding could not also overturn the decision. This lead to a very difficult 30 or so mins where both myself and my wife were getting very upset with how we and particularly my son had been treated which for me left me in tears as I could not believe we were having this issue with Disney. I had to ask my son to wait outside as I could also not bear for him to hear what was being said and he himself was getting upset. The manager at guest services went on to say that the DAS has been recently changed and that many customers were unhappy not only because of the decisions being made but because the decisions were being made by a separate team that no one could speak to in person which is far from ideal from a customer services point of view.In essence you had simply stated that my son was essentially not disabled enough to benefit from the DAS which I have no words to describe and again, I cant begin to explain to you how much this infuriates meWe have had many experiences of this sort in the past. We have visited Disney Land Paris on may occations whom are extremely accomodating where they essentially issue a ‚Äúfast pass‚Äù which allows my son to not queue. I had understood that the DAS scheme would offer a specific time slot for when we could entire a ride and hence we would not need to queue but this was not available. I should go on to note, that we visited Universal Studios the day before whom had offered this type of pass which did help and should also not the airline companies for example allow us to board first so that my son does not need to stand in a queue when boarding a plane. This is also something that is offered in airports were we are guided to a much shorter disabled queue to avoid queuing for a long period of time (in passport control for example) when the main queue is long. In essence, during this trip, Disney has been the only company that has not tried to accommodate the needs of my son in any way at all!I could simply not understand the decision Disney had made and quite frankly it ruined both days that we spent at Disney Parks. We managed very few rides, simply because my son could not stand or sit in his wheelchair for that amount of time. Any healthcare professional with an understanding of cerebral palsy would have understood this and we even brought documentation from Theo‚Äôs Healthcare providers in the UK that clearly stated that Theo could not stand in a queue for an extended period of time and that other considerations should be provided because of thisDisney made no effort to accommodate my son‚Ä¶In fact what we noted during our time at Disney is that there were actually very few disabled guests utilising your lightning pass or disabled queues other than elderly individuals that clearly had more physical capacity than my son when we observed them transitioning. I will go as far as to say that Disney simply seemed to be more concerned about selling lightning passes rather than accommodating the needs of disabled guests.With the process that Disney currently employs you are simply introducing more discrimination and further lack of equality amongst disabled guests‚Ä¶decisions which appear to be made by individuals that are not qualified to make such decisionsThe above is my formal complain and I expect you to take this very seriously as I am prepared to make a lot of ‚Äúnoise‚Äù about this particularly with the disabled community through social mediaThere is much you can do to improve your existing DAS process if you chose to listen and action the feedback that you are receiving from your guestsThe original manager that I spoke to at guest services offered to refund the money that we had paid for the 2 day passes for all 7 guests.

I love Disney but they have lost their way in greed.  The people and facilities are great but the crowds are to the point they take the joy out of the parks.   Over two hours for every key attraction kills the body but also takes the joy out of the trip.   I took my adultfamily to Disney and at every turn including food options were over crowded.  In my view this is the result of accountants and not park lovers leading the system.  I have been to the parks perhaps 10 times with my family and this time it left me frustrated because everything was overcrowded even the stores.,Food Quality
"Way too overcrowded!! This lead to anxiety for my whole family! We loved our 2022 trip which was magical but the park was strict to their capacity of people! I feel as if the staff was exhausted and less hospital this year.  In fact, one staff member was extremely rude with one of our family members as embarking on a ride. They claimed he moved a red bag from his seat which he knew nothing about. They sternly raised their voice at him and said ‚Äú Get Up!‚Äù It was so rude I thought they were acting in character. My brother stood up confused and then they realized they were wrong and then asked him to sit down. This was not the Mickey experience I have had in the past! The Workers I am sure are exhausted from the amount of people that were there to tend too and didn‚Äôt notice all the fine details like they did in 2022. My boys had special ears made by their grandmother that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 5‚Äùand this year it said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 8‚Äù to ring in their birthday! 3 years ago just about every worker said happy birthday and gave them a balloon and pin right as they entered the park. This year, nothing! I feel as if they are now putting profit over people. Sadly we will probably never go back like we said we would! This year I lost the magical feeling I had a few years ago. Just makes me sad more than anything! Also the lines were unbearably long so unless you have a lightning ‚ö°Ô∏è pass don‚Äôt expect to ride more than few rides in a day. It‚Äôs just impossible to ride them all on busy weeks like new years! We went to parks 28th-Jan 4th. So glad to be home and recover!",Staff Friendliness
"What happened to the Disney I remember from my childhood?

That's right, the regular $200 ticket is basically worthless, so Disney milks you for more money... and after 12+ hours in the park, we were still unable to go on all the rides.Disney lets too many people into the parks, the rides are constantly breaking down, and the Lightning pass is great ... IF you are wealthy and can afford the extra money to guarantee THREE rides. That's right, you will spend roughly $80 per ride, unless you have the endurance to wait in line for 1 - 1.5 hours PER RIDE.This makes me so sad that I think I am done with Disney after four decades of enjoying it with my parents and later introducing my own family.

"(Would give zero if I could).My advice buy a car, buy a holiday anywhere else (Universal Studios, Smithoion Museums, invest, or just save it.Having spent close to $8,000 USD for Disney World and the premier pass, for 4 days at a top hotel.My disappointment is with the overall experience, from the app (convoluted, clunky, and slow ) which you must use with the spotty park networks.  To the bad information available from Disney's own web sites (multiple maps had wrong information) to park information being wrong and then directing you to the website or app.  To the outdated Broadwalk hotel with it broken vending machines, and rooms with broken blinds and curtains and non functioning showers.  To the Magicbands that were not setup correctly and then stopped working after 1 day.To the food that comes from a can, is over cooked, and cold.

DANGER!!!!!!!!!!! DANGER !!!!!!!!!!!!!DANGERI have just left Disney Magic Kingdom a very shocked and relieved parent!Over crowded to a level that I and several others were afraid for there children. After the fireworks we found ourselves jammed in tight with no possible escape routes. I spoke with a lady beside me trying to take care of two small children and one in a stroller who was struggling to protect her family and then watched as teenagers stepped over her stroller that had an infant in it. With no help from staff the crowd started to work together to make it safe.I was there as part of a 20 plus people family trip with my young kids all waiting to see the magic so I chose to stay when the rest of our party left within 2 hrs of arrival. Not willing to repeat this experience I went to the office to get a refund on the second day on my tickets to be meet by very pleasant staff that although pleasant point blank refused to refund anything to us. I suggested these tickets should not have been sold to people if they are not in a position to protect there guests. I was then even more shocked to be told they were running at just over 50% capacity.Shame on you and I suggest you review your safety protocols before the world get to see a headline news story!,Staff Friendliness
"I took an overview of this place as I walked. Everywhere I looked I saw tidings of hate. The unhappy faces of the rushed crowd, the morbidly obese patrons waddling down Main Street, the absurd price tags on a piece of cloth with eyes. The FED has some blame there, but let's not enter that rabbit hole. Then there were the rides. I beheld a broken, corrupt and ruined political message in Splash Mountain. The once kid friendly, imaginative ride has become a tottered weed of small worth held. I witnessed the desecration of Pirates with its dismissal of humor in favor of political thinking. The once sex driven, ruthless pirates are now Gen Z alcoholic camarades. A perfect representation of our current culture really. The lady in the barrel is gone. Where is the maelstrom and the horizon? Where is the redhead at the auction? They have passed like rain on the mountain, like  wind in the meadow.",Ticket Pricing

"My wife and I were at Disney on the first day of what should have been a 2-day park hopper visit. We went to Magic Kingdom but as it was very busy, transferred to Epcot. This was where the problem happened.We decided to do the Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind ride. We queued for over one and a half hours for this ride. There was no indication the queue would be this long. We were filtered into large rooms where people were let in behind us as we funnelled through to very restrictive areas. It did not feel safe or comfortable and was very claustrophobic. This was borne out when someone collapsed in the queue. The ride was fine but had we known the queue would be this long and uncomfortable, we would not have bothered.We were really upset and put off by what happened and just wanted to leave. We didn't want to come the next day and my wife was upset as her previous visit had been so different and she was very disappointed in the organization of this ride.We went to the Customer Service and they charged us for a full day with park hopper and refunded the small balance as they said that was all they could do. We had no choice but to accept this. We went to Hollywood Studios but our hearts weren't in it and we left after 30 mins. The whole day had been ruined.Back at the hotel in the afternoon, we realised we had paid over $500 for 3 hours, most of which had been spent queuing. This seems extortionate and unfair for what was a situation created by them. We did talk to them by mail but they seemed only interested in feedback on how well they had responded: honestly, incredibly poorly. This was supposed to be the highlight of our US trip and has ended up being a very unpleasant experience. If you're looking for rides and better organisation and customer care, go to Universal instead.",Customer Service

I‚Äôll give the maintenance crew credit for responding quickly.  Literally zero apology from management, discount‚Ä¶nothing.  Just gross experience. Parks:  Not sure what was going on but 75% of the rides had issues.  Delays.  Made us miss some of our lightning passesRestaurants:  overall fine.  Really expensive and not that great.  We missed the whole fireworks show at Magic Kingdom because our reservation at Liberty Tree Tavern was 40 minutes delayed.  Why make a reservation? Anyway.  Magic is gone.  The prices are up.

Disney has lost its care and empathy. This was my 14th trip to Disney which has always been made comfortable with DAS with ADHD I find the lines a completely sensory overload. Along with time blindness and needing structure it always helped me be able to cope in my ‚Äúhappy place‚Äù. The lightning lane we purchased was awful. The times can be 8 hours till your next ride line. This time I visited got told I wasn‚Äôt disabled enough‚Ä¶ wild concept that they can decide who can cope and who cannot. It was absolutely traumatic. A really bad holiday experience. I truly wish could function like a normal human being and be able to stand normal lines but sadly my brain is not wired that way. The whole time it was so mentally painful we cancelled our trip we had booked in 2025. I will never step foot in Disney world again. Disney is no longer my one break I got from life‚Äôs struggles. Since childhood I have been Disney for life but now. Absolutely nothing makes me want to go or even watch any move it‚Äôs so triggering. So I would say if you‚Äôre neurodivergent avoid it! The simple solution would be for them to ask for medical proof as I am aware the system got abused. Genuine people are now suffering but Disney does not care. üòå All about the dollar and greed over guests comfort/experience. The bad thing is they won‚Äôt refund your tickets once you‚Äôre through the gate.. but you can‚Äôt apply for DAS as an international until you are through the gate!!,Accessibility Issues

We were so excited our oldest had a wrestling tournament in Orlando the week before Christmas. We were in Disney November 2012 and the holiday magic was beyond special. We wanted our 3 children to experience it and finally remember it now that they are older. What a disappointment. Ticket prices were beyond expensive and the magic was gone. None of the special landscape and holiday decorations that filled the park. Cheap projected images on the castle. Less of everything in the park. Less entertainment. More money for everything AND less of a special experience. Truly broke this mom's heart my children do not remember the magic Disney once provided for the holidays.,Ticket Pricing

"I started dating my husband in 1999. In 2000 when i was 26, he took me to Disney for the first time, our first vacation together. (He had been coming here since December 1971, three weeks after it officially opened when he was 4; he had already been to WDW many, many times). This was magical for me to say the least, as I had an unfortunate childhood and had only dreamt of going to Disney, never thinking it would come true one day. We had such a wonderful time, that Disney World became a regular thing for us (we are from NY, so time off, air travel, and resort stays were always factored in). In 2004, we got engaged on a yacht in front of MK during the Wishes grand finale. We got an annual pass for a couple of years and I started running the Disney races and marathons. They were a blast! Disney World became such a magical place for us, I eventually decided that I would like to get to Disney 50 times by my 50th birthday. Well, it happened! Shortly after i turned 50, we flew to Disney for my 50th WDW trip! We have stayed at every resort at least once, and this time we stayed at Port Orleans Riverside. We went to Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party for the first time, and we also visited EPCOT where i went on my favorite ride of all time, four times in a row, Guardians of the Galaxy. We made Disney ours. Some people don't get it. They don't have to. But for those of you who get it, IYKYK. Here's hoping you all get a piece of that happy magic we got! Attached you will see a picture of us at our first trip to WDW in 2000, and my 50th trip about 24 years later.",Event Experiences
"I am writing as a longtime Disney devotee, who has visited at least one of the parks (often two) with my entire/extended family every single year without fail, for the past 28 years.My wife and I got engaged at the Port Orleans Resort in 1996, we honeymooned at the Caribbean Beach Resort in 1997, we brought our first child as a baby to All Star Movies in 2000...well, you get the picture.Disney parks have long been part of our lives..our two daughters have practically grown up in them.They hold so many fantastic memories for us...and I've¬†always recognised the commitment to maintaining Walt Disney's original ideals, integrity and family values.But our latest trip will be our last.For us, the magic has gone.And the charm, personality and dedication to incredible customer service has gone also.Prices have been hiked, while previously-included services have been cut.""What's the very best we can aspire to?"" has been replaced by ""What can we can get away with?""""And what can we charge extra for?""More importantly, cast members who would routinely go the extra mile for every single guest, have been replaced by an entirely new breed, who don't know the answer to your question...and really don't care.I'll give you an example.A security supervisor at the main entrance to the Magic Kingdom...older guy, with a bad attitude and a power complex.Surely the worst 'cast member' I've ever witnessed, in almost 30 years of annual Disney visits.With his attitude, he should NEVER be allowed anywhere near members of the public - he's literally a lawsuit waiting to happen.The friendly, welcoming security staff of the past have been replaced by clowns like him.Aggressive, abrasive, impatient...and absolutely charmless.I'll explain...I was looking for a smoking area outside the park, and was directed towards a nearby bench, having asked another cast member.Wrongly, as it turned out...apparently he didn't actually know where the smoking area was, and had just guessed (!).The security guard ran over, and screamed ""PUT THAT OUT!!"" at the top of his voice, scaring nearby children.When I tried to explain I had been directed to that exact spot by a cast member, he screamed even louder: ""I DONT CARE!!"", much to the horror of parents and other cast members nearby.Twenty years ago, staff of that 'calibre' wouldn't have got near a job with Disney, let alone be allowed to assume a position of responsibility.I saw him bark at several other families in the same way, just in the following minutes that I was watching him.Now, is this really the first Disney cast member they want welcoming families from all over the world, as they visit their flagship park?There was also Casey, a dim-witted bus driver who inexplicably drove off with most of the spaces on his bus left empty, leaving three lines of frustrated guests, shouting after him.And the entire Disney Guest Relations team at the Dolphin Hotel..six of them, sat chatting among themselves behind the desk.Now there was a time when we described Disney Guest Relations staff as the 'Special Forces' of Disney....there was literally nothing they couldn't or wouldn't do for you.You'd go in with a complaint, and come out with a smile.Not any more...as when I asked if any of them knew where I could buy cigars, they all just looked at each other, shrugged and said: ""No idea...""When I pointed out there was a stocked humidor less than 100ft away from them, at the Shulas Steakhouse on the same floor of the hotel they were currently in, they hurriedly tried to backtrack.""Ah yes, ask the concierge..he often finds out if anyone from Shulas comes in early with a key?""Hang on....a moment ago, you claimed not to know anywhere that sold cigars?Either way, someone's not telling the truth.Smoking is a contentious issue, and I appreciate they probably don't want smokers at their parks and resorts, hence dramatically reducing the number of smoking areas.Thats absolutely fine and understandable, but if this is the case, why not just be honest, so we can all book our holidays elsewhere?Far better this than hiding designated areas, not putting out signs, not training staff to deal with it and generally pretending we don't exist?I had this very conversation several times a day with dozens of other smokers, all of whom felt unwelcome and unwanted.The smokers are often the bill-payers, and this seems like a really good way of driving all of us and our families offsite and into non-Disney bars and restaurants in the surrounding areas.For the first time ever, we had dinner off-property every single evening on our recent trip, and from conversations with other families, this seems to be a fast-growing trend.Previously, we'd go two or even three weeks without once leaving Disney property, but this actually opened up a whole new aspect of Orlando for us.Offsite restaurants have always been cheaper, especially with Disney's dramatic price hikes in recent years, but I always considered them inferior, compared to the food and service of onsite staff, with the obvious advantage of remaining in the Disney 'bubble'.Now I find this is no longer the case....local establishments have really raised their game, and the food, service and (especially) overall value often exceeds that of Disney restaurants.The future of the company though, probably rests with the likes of Bryson, a (very) keen young maintenance assistant at All Star Movies, who told me of his lifelong ambition to work for Disney, and his undoubted pride in his new job.I wished him well, but although he definitely deserves to pursue a career in the corporation we've both admired for so long, is the Disney of today really deserving of young people like him, who are prepared to dedicate their lives to it?I'm not sure it is, anymore.I wish the company all the very best for the future, but my family and I (along with lots of others, apparently) will not be visiting again.",Customer Service

For example, we opted to explore Star Wars: Galaxy‚Äôs Edge instead and returned later to find a shorter line for Slinky Dog.The character interactions were a highlight. They didn‚Äôt just pose for photos and move on; they took the time to engage, making the experience feel truly magical‚Äîsomething I haven‚Äôt experienced at other parks.My only critique is the high cost of quick-service food and water within the park‚Äînearly double what you‚Äôd pay elsewhere.

"Never go to Disney when they have special events going on. The $200 ticket to get you in part of the day has to be supplemented.

I first went to Disney world in the 70s it was great. Great attractions short lines. Went again last year oh the crowds the unbelievable long lines. Literally over an hour wait. Yes the rides are wonderful but the cost and lines ruin it all. I will never go again   oh and if you pay even more you can skip ahead of some of the lines  that's real fair.

It didn't disappoint bringing back all my childhood memories and I am so glad we visited.As an adult you only need to go once to see what is there as even in mid-November it was the busiest of all the parks we visited. Try and buy as little as possible too as it is as you would expect, hugely expensive.",Ticket Pricing

Woke up early to get over to Hollywood Rise of the Resistance only to arrive and it was out of service, same at Magic Kingdom a few rides not available.Then the monorail was broken for 40 minutes sitting there just waiting and waiting.

"WDW was fantastic mid-end November ( apart from crowds). Temperature was lovely and the atmosphere and decorations were wonderful. Disabled adult accommodated well through DAS. Food in quick service restaurants was good value and good quality. No need to buy drinks, free water is available everywhere. Epcot was very busy at all times. Food festival finished a few days before advertised date of 28 Nov. Best day to visit Magic Kingdom was on days where it closed early for the Christmas event - lines on those days were short and you can pop in to another park when MK closes. HS and AK were both busy at all times but seats at Fantasmic could still be found within minutes of the show time starting. Transport was efficient and easy to navigate. Would recommend a visit at Christmas, at least once. Bring all your Christmas t-shirts and clothes - everyone is super Christmassy dressedüéÑThanksgiving meals were not available throughout parks but was available in All-Star Resort and was tasty and great value. Some rides did break and staff were very poor at dealing with situation. Staff not as good as summer - many chatting to each other instead of helping, especially in main shop in Epcot, and at ride entry points.Would recommend a Christmas visit to WDW.",Accessibility Issues

"Better than universal, but nowhere near as good as it used to be.  Crazy expensive for what is actually provided.  Way too overcrowded for the capacity of the parks - barely impossible to move around for much of our visit, yet alone get on anything.  Staff and food were extremes of either very good or absolutely terrible (very little in between.).  Increasing changes in the parks are also dull - for example conversion of Splash Mountain to Tiana‚Äôs. Just dull, and no need to change something that was really good for something that‚Äôs average at best and spent most of the time during our visit broken down.   The shoehorning of stale movie IP into parks was also tedious.  Disney used to have imagination and use the parks as a way of creating new stories.  Now it‚Äôs all about extending the life of some pretty overused and tired franchises.   Hotel was crazy money for the quality of the room.  Transport was slow and, again, overcrowded.  Overall, Disney World isn‚Äôt what it used to be and wouldn‚Äôt be somewhere I‚Äôd rush back to again - it just isn‚Äôt worth it anymore.",Ticket Pricing

Disney has gone down and is not a place I will go back too anytime soon. I will come to Orlando for the new Epic universal park though.  Disney keeps going up on prices on everything and they nickel and dime u even though u paid ridiculous amount for tickets with very long waits in hot sun to ride a 1 min ride.   I highly do not recommend this Woke company who is only for profit and could care less if u have a good time.  A lot of rides break down for long hours and some rides are down for over a year or two which means u are paying for less attractions at the same time u are paying high ticket prices regardless.   Highly do not recommend Disney and Walt is rolling in his grave on how they turned his theme park to üí©!   Go to universal for thrill rides Disney does not have any!

They needed tons more chairs- no place to sit.There were too many people in park. They should limit people in park.",Customer Service

"We did AK, MK, HS, and Epcot in 4 days. 22.5 miles.It was exhausting but could have been much better. Epcot was the only park with plenty of bench areas. Others need serious improvements. Especially MK! The could line main street with benches. All the iron work walls and rock walls could be widen for comfortable seating.It was disappointing to discover the first line was just security which got you to another line (scanning) to another line (rope drop) to all areas of parks, to the line at the ride, which was already 45 minutes! This rope drop system is a joke and doesn't buy you anything. Sleep in. Lightning lane help a lot. Tiannas virtual queue was a joke. Pushed button and missed morning all together, got 126 in evening at immediate push. Had to check all day long to see how it was coming along which was interruptive for planning all day. One of the last groups of the day. Very little seating for the wait. Then broke down 4 times while on it. And story line was horrible. Tianna just kept reappearing from scene to scene. Skip it!!The need cart shuttle from bus transportation to entrance. Or stay in a resort with monorail service.Even with lightning lanes plan on an average of about 6 rides a day. Maybe you'll get lucky.Plan on $300 a day for 3 at quick service only.Definitely bump up to a higher level hotel rather than All Star for a better experience! Work out hard months before going unless young and active. Wait until the kiddos are old enough to remember it. Otherwise we saw tons of families struggling with strollers and the kids won't even remember.  8 to 10 is a good range.",Attraction Availability

We went with the grandkids and family.  We used a Disney travel agent which made everything so much easier.  We stayed at POP Century and visited all 4 parks.

"I never imagined leaving Disney World feeling so disappointed and let down. My husband was injured while riding the Aerosmith Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roller Coaster at Hollywood Studios due to what I believe is a lack of proper safety measures. At 6‚Äô9‚Äù, he did not fit properly in the ride‚Äôs seat, but no upper height limit was posted, and the cast member failed to ensure his restraints were properly aligned. This led to him being thrown around during the ride, which, combined with mild sunburn blisters on his shoulders, caused the skin to rip off entirely.While the sunburn contributed, the injury was a direct result of the poor fit of the restraints and Disney‚Äôs failure to ensure guest safety. This could have been prevented with an upper height limit or more thorough checks by staff.The incident was traumatic for both of us. Disney‚Äôs First Aid team insisted my husband be taken out of the park in an ambulance, which he was. However, we decided not to admit him to the hospital due to concerns about medical costs. Since then, he has been in constant pain, which has severely impacted our ability to enjoy the parks.What has left us even more upset is Disney‚Äôs response‚Äîor lack thereof. Despite reaching out and explaining the situation in detail, they refused to acknowledge the safety issues or offer any compensation for our ruined holiday. They directed us to a U.S. claims number, which is incredibly difficult to access as we live in the UK. Their only response was to reiterate their no-refund policy, showing no compassion or care for the injury caused by their ride.We spent a significant amount on this trip‚Äîpark tickets, flights, and accommodations‚Äîand to have it overshadowed by an injury caused by negligence, only to be brushed aside, is unacceptable. Disney markets itself as a company that values guest experience, but this situation has proven otherwise.I am deeply disappointed, not just in the handling of the injury but in Disney‚Äôs failure to address the safety concerns that led to it. Guests‚Äîespecially taller ones‚Äîshould be warned about the potential risks. I sincerely hope Disney takes these issues seriously and improves its approach to guest safety and accountability.",Staff Friendliness

"This is a hard review for me. I love the magic at WDW and have enjoyed the past 3 visits so much that I had high hopes for the 4th.Unfortunately, Disney is no longer accessible for those with disabilities unless you stay on site and pay an exorbitant amount (upwards of $500) for the premier LL. The premier LL utilizes the same line and system that DAS previously used. We were aware of this prior and were so disappointed but decided to give Disney a chance anyway and splurge on Multi Pass LL and Single Ride LL so that we could ride at least a couple of the rides we had been waiting to try. Despite booking right at 7AM 3 days in advance, we got absolutely no return times for the two rides my kids had wanted (Slinky Dog and ROR). A cast member told me to continuously check back but nothing ever opened. So we paid an extra, nearly $80, to never get to ride anything we came for, on top of an already $600 admission for my family of 4. Our first Disney day, we did get on Frozen mid-afternoon with multi-pass but Remys never opened up. LL ‚Äúsells out‚Äù so don‚Äôt plan on riding anything unless you get the return time prior to going to the parks. The chances of the LL opening are almost 0. We even purchased standby skipper to help, which was a massive waste of money.Depending on your disability there are now absolutely no accommodations for you. We were made to believe that they added accommodations for people in the standby queue but that is not the case.This trip was our last, the magic has dried up. Money hungry awfulness has taken over. I‚Äôm sick to my stomach even writing this review.Please don‚Äôt bring anyone with a disability or disease here that cannot wait in standby queues. The only exception being, if you plan to purchase premier LL for $500 (only available to those staying at top tier WDW resorts so go your research in advance).I genuinely wish we never came this visit so we would‚Äôve had our last Disney experience be a positive one, but I suppose we had to learn the hard way and I hope this can at least be a cautionary tale for others. We wasted hundreds of dollars to have to watch our kids faces sink when we couldn‚Äôt wait in the standby line. Don‚Äôt do it. Make your own magic at home.",Accessibility Issues

"I prepaid for Lightning Lane in addition to my park tickets in order to preschedule specific experiences and maximize my time in the parks. In return, Disney failed to deliver on its promise of providing those experiences at the designated times I selected - which is the main benefit you're paying extra for. This happened several times over 3 days (Frozen @ Epcot, Pirates @ Magic Kingdom & twice @ Rise of the Resistance @ Hollywood Studios).  In Epcot, when my ""Tier 1"" selection (Frozen) broke down, I couldn‚Äôt exchange it for ‚ÄúRemy‚Äù (another Tier 1 option). I was offered the ‚ÄúPixar Short Film Festival‚Äù as a possible replacement - which is an insulting replacement option!In my second try at Rise of the Resistance, when we were finally able to ride several hours after our return window,  our experience completely skipped the shuttle ride sequence from the Rebel base!  This is about half the total attraction and sets up the rest of the attraction!Disney is not forthcoming with refunds when you either can't experience the attractions you book with this service, or when they charge you full price for the ""half experience"" I got on Rise of the Resistance.  If you are unhappy, they instruct you to spend your day waiting in line at Guest Services, which almost always has long waits due to the amount of other guests complaining.Disney does offer a chat feature through it's My Disney Experience app, but when I attempted to use this to get a refund for my first missed Rise of the Resistance experience, it took 80 minutes and I was forced to chat about the refund during my expensive anniversary dinner at the Brown Derby!One thing I will mention - without the Lightning Lane service, you will spend a lot of time in line if the attraction you booked is not broken.  It's a catch-22 - and at an extra $50+ per person/per day an expensive conundrum.I had horrible experiences dealing with Disney Cast members over these Lightning Lane failures.  I will not be going back to the Disney Parks!SIDENOTE - I had much better experiences dealing with team members at Universal Studios.

"I remember what Disney was like several years ago during Halloween it was great Pumpkins everywhere, this Halloween I was disappointed you hardly saw any pumpkins this year and we paid for the Not So Scary Halloween party that was a waist of money. The wait time kept being pushed back further for the parade to start and we were given out candy bags for the trick or treat we didn‚Äôt get any. And they closed the rides early. So it was a waist of a park ticket. The only good part of the Not So Scary Halloween party was the Hocus Pocus Villain's party at the castle other than that this year I was disappointed. We couldn‚Äôt do a lot of the rides cause they needed fixing which I understand that but it‚Äôs annoying when you only have one day at the park most of the rides needing repair and you can‚Äôt go on any during that day. Next time I‚Äôd rather just go to the Christmas event. Much better than the Halloween Disney.

"Dear Mr. Iger WDW losing its magic for guests with disabilities. I firmly believe Walt Disney World is becoming a less friendly place for disabled guests. Let me explain:I am a mobility and emotionaly disabled individual (I suffer from lower bilateral neuropathy as well as anxiety and OCD.) I need to ride an electric scooter while visiting the parks, and I understand that Disney has made the queues more scooter friendly, but that doesn‚Äôt make the anxiety of waiting in long lines friendlier as well. Up to a couple of months back I used to be able to get a  DAS (Disability Access Service) pass so I wouldn‚Äôt have to wait long periods of time in line, which causes my anxiety flair up and take away a lot of the fun the ride is supposed to to give me. I have been an annual pass holder for various periods of my life, but a few weeks back, when I tried to register again for the DAS I was informed that what used to be a reason for me to get it is not a good enough reason to get it currently, I was given a bunch of ways to avoid the long lines, that I consider a way of Disney becoming more disabled unfriendly.  Why the reasons that were enough a few months back are not good enough now? I have medical opinions that I suffer from the previous mentioned problems, but I was told that Disney is not able to accept medical reasons as a reason  to provide DAS. After being a loyal Disney fan for over 47+ years, becoming disabled unfriendly is making me not being able to keep enjoying Disney for the rest of my life. Obviously I am not planning to renew my yearly pass next year, what would be the use of doing so? I understand one loyal fan nor renewing an annual pass in not an economic concern for the Disney organization. But it is a very disappointing reason for a long time fan of  Disney not being able to continue enjoying one of the most exciting experiences for a very long time.

"This is the absolute WORST Disney experience I have ever had. I have been coming to these parks since I was 4 years old. As a continued annual pass holder, I have always been eligible for the DAS system, due to many different physical medical conditions. I have regularly used it for years with my best friend who has also qualified for it. We both have debilitating physical conditions that are recognized as disabilities with permanent handicap placards. As today is my birthday, I wanted to go to the parks with a group of friends where we tried to go to Disney and use our DAS. We were extremely disappointed when we found out we don‚Äôt ‚Äúqualify‚Äù for accommodations. We have encountered this problem before and we have tried the alternative ‚Äúaccommodations‚Äù (if they can even be considered as accommodations). As both of us have neurological, sensory, and physical medical conditions, standing in lines in extremely crowded areas is not conducive in being able to enjoy the park. Ride swap does not allow us to be with our whole party, attraction reentry forced us to be away from our group for extended periods of time, and providing a wheelchair did not reduce physical contact with other inconsiderate guests. With DAS we were able to be with our group in a line that was less crowded and accommodated our conditions significantly better.After waiting an HOUR in the park to speak with someone in the chat, the agent was extremely rude and informed us that only individuals who are diagnosed with autism qualify for the DAS system now. When asked why mobility and neurological medical conditions are not able to qualify for the DAS system, I was met with a tone of irritation and condescension.As I know the DAS system was being taken advantage of, I understand the rules has to be changed. However, Universal is a great example of theme parks assisting with mobility disabilities, as you have to obtain physician documentation explaining why the individual needs the DAS system.Disney has made this the worst park experience I‚Äôve ever had and a very ‚Äúunbirthday‚Äù birthday. This felt like the most discriminatory form of rules and regulation. Some have said, ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be going to the parks if your condition is that serious‚Äù, but Disney has NEVER forced me to adopt that mentality, until today. I NOT be returning to the Disney parks until the Disney company enacts a more accommodating system for individuals who suffer from ALL types of disabilities.",Accessibility Issues

"We had been a couple of times on our last trip so this was a do the big rides as opposed to a full day. They had the Halloween theming up and it looked really good. We first of all did the Pirates of the Caribbean and I bet you can smell the water as you read this. Next up was Haunted Manor and while in queue we managed to get virtual queue slots for Tron as that was a big win having failed at 7am. After a spot of lunch we headed for a spot to watch the parade and then went on the jungle cruise before they shut it for refurbishment. This was when the problem of Florida in August hit as a big thunder and lightening storm slowly moved into the area which lead to an hour delay due to poor weather. What frustrated the queue more was the fact that once the weather had passed it took nearly another 45 minutes to get things running again despite hot sun. After this we did the new look Tiana's bayou adventure which was as good as splash mountain had been before trying out the new DOLE whip mango and Chamoy Float with chilli lime seasoning, this got reviews of nice but bit too much chilli, hmm ok but wont have again, meh does anyone want to finish mine, to OMG thats horrible, so I don't think we will be trying them again. This set us up for the final destination of the day TRON having seen it under construction 5 yrs ago, we couldn't wait to ride it. With the cunning Disney way of this is the last bit of queue before the ride, oh no there's more being used to full effect in this line the anticipation built. The ride position was good and wow what a thrill, easily the best ride in a Disney park by a long way.",Seasonal Events

"We recently went to WDW, October 5-11, 2024....yes, we were there during Hurricane Milton.  My only comment I have is, we've been to Disney over 20+ times in the last 10 years.  It amazes me how many people Disney packs into these parks on a given day.  The lines for rides was ridiculous.  I don't think I saw any ride under 90 minutes!  5 years ago, it wasn't like that.  If you wanted to get on a ride, you either had to be the first one in the park or go online and sign up for a Lightening Lane time.  I never went early, but one of my family members said they went to one of the parks during rope drop, you get in early, but the popular rides don't open until the park officially opens.  So you're getting there early, just to get in line for a ride.  Crazy!  Years ago, rides would be open at rope drop.  The new Lightening Lanes are expensive.  Disney, bring back Fast Pass.  People pay lots of money just to get into the park (on top of hotel, food, etc.), the least you can do is give them the free Fast Pass back.  Although we were there during Hurricane Milton, the hotel we stayed at kept us safe (I'll review that hotel next), fed and entertained until the storm passed.  With Disney adding 2 new lands to MK, be prepared in 2025 for many rides to be temporarily closed or closed for good, and for lots of construction walls.  With those new lands, means more people.  I honestly can say, this trip was probably our last time going to WDW.  Sad to say it, but Disney is all about how much money they can make.  Sad :(",Ticket Pricing
Had a wonderful time at Disney World.  I found it to be accommodating to disabilities from parking to the rides.   The staff were friendly and so willing to help me get on/off the rides.  The downside of the Disney experience was the cost of the tickets and how many kids would not get to experience it due to the cost.  However it was still Disney and me having great memories of my first going to Disneyland in 1963 and several times throughout the years.,Accessibility Issues

"This is my second experience to a Disney theme park, the first being Paris which I have to say is better for younger children.The park in Orlando is beautiful especially with the autumn decorations up but the lines to get on rides were 2-3 hours and trying to keep younger children entertained for this long was impossible. One ride had a fast track line of 2 hours 44minues. There was no little outdoor parks that we could find so children spent most of time in Disney buggy in the heat. We ended up leaving at 2pm as 2 rides were shut and only managed to go on carousel and speedway.

I went on a band trip although it was pricey same with the food. We had a lot of fun on some of the rides with a lot of friends and some food. Some rides you do have to book before you go or really one Tron. We went to some rides and some other rides I don't remember the names but they were a lot of fun. We did not go to all the islands that were part of Disney but we still had as fun considering we were on one island  for a whole day.

"Just returned from a rather disappointing two week stay at DWFL. They have already spanked you for ¬£1000s to go then want to squeeze you for every penny whilst there. Bottled water $5, bottled coke $6 small bottle. Poncho for when it rains $12 it rains every day now. Stayed in one of the resorts, paid $80 for refillable drink cups, can't be used in the parks even though owned by same company. Paid $120 each for trick n treat experience. Ended up soaking again all sweets were sodden due to stalls dishing them out being in the rain. Booked my stay 2.5 years ago. Was informed I'd qualify for the DAS pass as disabled. System has now changed to a CAST MEMBER assessing your disability requirements, I had Doctor letters, lists of medications and my specialist letters, complete waste of time. After being made to do a video call to a CAST MEMBER In front of other guests I was refused after 2 minutes. Felt totally robbed and would never set foot there ever again. It's not about magic for the family, it's about extortionate prices for run of the mill tatt.For what was paid for this what should of been a holiday of a lifetime we feel totally let down by an uncaring greedy corporation.

"Just returned from a rather disappointing two week stay at DWFL. They have already spanked you for ¬£1000s to go then want to squeeze you for every penny whilst there. Bottled water $5, bottled coke $6 small bottle. Poncho for when it rains $12 it rains every day now. Stayed in one of the resorts, paid $80 for refillable drink cups, can't be used in the parks even though owned by same company. Paid $120 each for trick n treat experience. Ended up soaking again all sweets were sodden due to stalls dishing them out being in the rain. Booked my stay 2.5 years ago. Was informed I'd qualify for the DAS pass as disabled. System has now changed to a CAST MEMBER assessing your disability requirements, I had Doctor letters, lists of medications and my specialist letters, complete waste of time. After being made to do a video call to a CAST MEMBER In front of other guests I was refused after 2 minutes. Felt totally robbed and would never set foot there ever again. It's not about magic for the family, it's about extortionate prices for run of the mill tatt.For what was paid for this what should of been a holiday of a lifetime we feel totally let down by an uncaring greedy corporation.

"They need bigger hitting rides. Most of the rides are old and un interesting. The park looks and feels dirty. The queues for the mediocre rides were long, over an hour and a lot of the wait times were vastly understated. The parade was joyful but  very short. The train ride was again  boring, you can't really see the park. Some of the commands from staff were like they were hearding sheep and got too much. The  highlight of the day was the Creme Brulee croissant in Gustovs. We lost the will to live and left the park early, not waisting anymore of our time. Hollywood Studios was outstanding and Animal Studios very good.",Park Cleanliness
"Just to be clear, this one star rating is for the hotel only, not Disney World in general. We were there for 9 nights: Aug. 31 - Sept. 9, 2024. We stayed at the Beach Club, which is one of the Deluxe resorts.We were on the fourth floor in the lobby wing, room 4206. This wing is in dire need of renovation and room 4206 needs to just be closed until they correct the problems I'm going to detail.The room itself was okay. Size was large and furniture was pretty old. But the biggest issue was with the maintenance of this room. It looks like at some time in the past there was a problem with flooding in the bathroom and sink area, because the bottom of the baseboards and bathroom door were beat up and deteriorated. Someone tried to repair the damage by simply squeezing a tube of grout all over the bottom of the baseboards. The bottom of the bathroom door was peeling off and had been painted to try to conceal this. All in all, these ""repairs"" looked like they were done by housekeeping, not by qualified professionals. They had a look that you expected to see in an old Motel 6, not a Disney resort and certainly not a deluxe resort.In addition, the toilet paper hanger on the wall in the bathroom had been ripped off and repaired by simply screwing it back on and putting a little putty and paint on it, without blending it into the wall. Again, something you'd expect in a low rent motel..Don't take my word for it - look at the pictures I attached. Is this something you'd expect to see in a room that can cost over $800 per night in some months?Finally, the electric plugs in the nightstand didn't work, and the ones under the television didn't work. This leads one to wonder if other things aren't being maintained - like the sprinkler or smoke alarm?Disney should be ashamed of itself for letting this room even be rented in this condition.The bottom line is you should avoid the Beach Club until and unless they renovate the rooms. Even then, you have to wonder about maintenance in other areas related to safety.",Park Cleanliness
"I arrived at Disney and make my way to guest services to speak to them about my disability as I have autism. I had been in touch with someone before I went to explain that I struggle in crowds of people, don‚Äôt like being touched my strangers and can become over stimulated in long and noisy lines. I was told that Disney are extremely supportive of people with disabilities and to make my way to guest services on the first day of the holiday and they could give me accommodations to help. That‚Äôs what I did. The experience was horrendous. I was told I had to video call with a third party agency who would decide if I was disabled enough to be given a DAS pass. I spoke to this person over the video call in the middle of guest services. The headphones were not working so I was having to shout into the tablet with guests around me listening to my medical history and talking about a disability I am extremely sensitive about- this in itself was very belittling and stressful. At the end of the video call they said I didn‚Äôt quality for a DAS pass as they only give it to people with autism. WHAT!!! That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm telling them I have. I offered to show my diagnosis but they were not interested. They told me I did quality for some accommodations and I could have my family queue and then join them when they are at the front or if things became too much to just leave the line. I said this would not be possible and that my family should not be split up to accommodate my disability. This is indirect discrimination. I also couldn‚Äôt leave the lines as it would mean walking through crowds of people which is actually the problem. They were not interested. I tried a second time on another video call with a different agent. Went through the whole embarrassing process again of shouting out my issues down a video call with everyone listening in and was then told I now had to speak to a healthcare professional. I did this and talked about all the accommodations I have at home to help me. Got to the end and the healthcare professional decided I was not autistic enough to qualify for a DAS pass. At this point I became very upset and thought well I may as well just go home as I won‚Äôt join queues for rides as my anxiety will be too bad. My holiday was saved thanks to two very lovely members of staff called Marcie and Brittany in animal kingdom guest services. They really sympathised with me and went above and beyond to help ensure my experience was not ruined. They could not override the decision that had been made by this third party but they did put a number of things in place to ensure the challenges I have were accommodated, meaning I could enjoy the rest of my time at Disney. I am so grateful to these two staff members. In relation to the DAS programme- this is a joke! It would appear that no one is ever granted a DAS pass and the decision whether you get one or not comes down to a 30 second conversation you have with a person who is not medically trained and has no understanding or neurodiversity. I understand some people take the Mickey (excuse the pun) but it should be as simple as a guest providing proof they have a disability and then a DAS pass is granted. The way I was made to feel, the 2 hours of stress I went through means that I am not unlikely to ever return to Disney again! Sort it out Disney- this is not very inclusive and what you are doing is actually indirect discrimination. I wasn‚Äôt granted a DAS pass as I didn‚Äôt present as autistic enough! WHAT! This is unacceptable and I will be taking this further!",Accessibility Issues

"I have been going to Disney World on average of 2 times a year for the past 32 years. over the past 10 years I have been using thier Dissability Access service because I have Neuropathy in both my feet, high blood pressure and Diabetes. Disney World's DAS has changed and now I am no longer able to use the service. Just came back from vacation at the WDW resorts and didn't have the same great experience i always have. Standing in longer lines made my feet hurt and couldn't get around the parks that much. I didn't have the magic I use to have. Still love Disney wish they would go back to the old DAS system.",Accessibility Issues

"We have been to Disney over 50 times over the course of the last 25 years. It absolutely never disappoints. It truly is the most magical place on earth. You can do Disney one of two ways: 1) park hop and go hard at it, or 2) relax at the resort, eat, shop and go into a park once or twice. You can make it as fast paced or as slow paced as you'd like. Book it now. You need at minimum a week if you've never been.",Planning Tips
"What can I say about Disney Kingdom? It‚Äôs the main park that you simply cannot skip when visiting Orlando. It‚Äôs the first among the four Disney theme parks, and if you have limited time, it‚Äôs the one to prioritize.The park is always quite crowded ‚Äì we visited on a day with moderate attendance (5/10), yet we still spent up to 50 minutes waiting for the major attractions. I highly recommend purchasing the skip-the-line option, but only if it includes the key attractions ‚Äì which can be tricky if you‚Äôre not a local, as you can‚Äôt buy them in advance, and the bundle of three often doesn‚Äôt include all the most popular rides. For this reason, I didn‚Äôt use it.That said, the experience remains magical. I recommend classic attractions like Space Mountain, as well as the brand-new TRON ride, which is fantastic, though a bit too short for my taste.A great alternative to reaching the park is by boat instead of the monorail, though it takes considerably more time.I would definitely go back!",Planning Tips
"Pretty disappointing overall - 2 week package with takeaway food option (one sit down meal per day was about ¬£70 per person per day more!). We stayed in a decent Disney resort. The good points - nice hotel, great staff generally, early access to parks means you get two rides before queues are stupid. Temperature with little cover. Transport (though see below). Clean.  Oh, memory maker - a free add on fir us - we found it great - over 500 photos of us taken by dedicated photographers on top of our own, including enhanced photos (e.g.Ratatouille mouse sat on son's hand)Negatives - FOOD PLAN - plain awful. Food in hotel was same options every day - 6 options, 2 being sandwiches, pizza (adults only), 4 options for kids - Mac n cheese (awful), breaded chicken strips, burger or ham n cheese toastie. Options in the parks was similarly awful being almost the same options. Some restaurants offered something different, but some of those didn't even do kids meals. 14 days on such limited options - not what you expect from such a price offering, nor for the quality of hotel we booked (¬£200 per day room only).Queue, queues, queues for just about all rides. Even meeting Disney characters is 35 - 45 min wait. Main rides 60 - 90 min waits - in 40C temps. Lack of shade around the parks and seating within that shade - only option is air con shops (intentionally so you spend?). Transport was great, tho because of thunderstorms we decided not to walk back round to the skyline and took a coach to our hotel (was waiting at its stop)... however the next day, we waited almost an hour at the same bus bay, marked for our hotel but nothing - asked another driver and he say they don't run unless the skyline might stop or is stopped (so we were lucky first day)... why oh why not put a notice to this effect. Gave this feedback (complaint) to hotel reception... think it went nowhere as he didn't seem to care (rare tho).  A number of rides across the parks were not working or sporadic, though we were not too affected here. Watch out for virtual queues - have to book at 7.00am, 1pm and 6pm. If you are one minute late, the slots are all gone. My real feel of Disney World is that it is about how much money you are willing to spend, lightning lanes, genie days, personal bookings (such as private memory makers, closed off viewing point for Epcot fireworks, personalised tour guides etc.).So to our final view - loved the parks, rides etc, queues and commercialisation awful, typhoon lagoon was brilliant for us (spent many afternoons there), so real positives... but the food was a deal breaker - so poor, we won't go back. Every day, food put a dampener on our experience. Even Disney fireworks can't put that right.",Staff Friendliness

"When arriving we all so excited but when we arrived it was utterly disappointing. Barely anything to do, ridiculously long queues, whole park was overcrowded and our whole family was constantly walked into, pushed by others to get to the front, everything was majorly overpriced especially just for a bottle of water that weren‚Äôt even cold. Only thing to do really was 2 rides and shopping to spend even more money for a top that was 100 dollars in literally every shop. Both kids were bored when walking around and when we went to animal kingdom we went to see the hippos and were hurried along by staff so weren‚Äôt even able to see them or take any pictures.

"We had a really mixed experience at Walt Disney World. My son is in a wheel chair, and anecdotally, I‚Äôd heard that Disney was extremely accessible, so we booked a trip that had a week at Disney and a week at Universal. We stayed in Coronado Springs, a Disney hotel, which was lovely.We did try to get a DAS pass, as the accessibility information wasn‚Äôt great at each ride, and we didn‚Äôt really know if our son could get on or not until we got to the front of a ride queue. They‚Äôve probably seen a surge in requests and have clamped down on this, which put my son into a pretty broad category and meant we‚Äôd have to queue and find out if we could get on the rides or not once we‚Äôd got to the front.Our first day was at Magical Kingdom, and we waited for 45 minutes to get onto the Pirates of the Caribbean ride; however, there was no transfer option offered, and it was just too low to get my son in and out of. The staff showed little empathy, and we had to abandon trying to get onto the ride. We then had a horrible experience at Big Thunder Mountain Railroad; again, staff at the queue didn‚Äôt offer any special advice or help. We waited a long time to get on the ride. I was able to get him on but really struggled to lift him out. A Disney lead actually came over, apologised, and informed us there was a carriage at the back that we could have used, which had a transfer option (the side must have been able to fold down to allow someone to slide on and off).After day 1, I was pretty upset, so I spent hours on YouTube reviewing videos uploaded by disabled users who‚Äôd visited the other parks. This helped a little, but we still had one further bad experience where we paid $80 for a lightning lane to get onto the Avatar ride, and my son just couldn‚Äôt get on the ride, which was heart breaking because the strap wouldn't shut behind his calf.Hollywood studio's was by far and away our favourite park and there were some brilliant moments, especially when a storm trooper interacted with our son, and we loved the Tron ride, which was extremely accessible, Guardians of the Galaxy, and rides like Rise of the Resistance. Overall, we had a good time and tried to shield the kids from a lot of the above.Universal, in contrast, was a more relaxing experience; we were able to get an IBCCES Accessibility card, and they approved us for an accessibility assistance pass, their equivalent DAS pass, and we had a much better experience. It didn‚Äôt always mean fast access but meant we could get a time to return, which importantly allowed us the ability to assess the ride and walk away if it wasn‚Äôt suitable, meaning we didn‚Äôt lose hours on rides we couldn‚Äôt go on. We never wanted to jump the queue at Disney but just wanted a time slot that matched the wait time so we could return and review the rides, they did offer this on occasion but it was very rare.",Accessibility Issues

We never wanted to jump the queue at Disney but just wanted a time slot that matched the wait time so we could return and review the rides, they did offer this on occasion but it was very rare.",Staff Friendliness
"This is my 4th trip to Disney World over a 20 year period and I can honestly say that Disney appears to have lost their way.  The whole set up is designed to extract the maximum amount of cash.....it's just so expensive now!  Investment in new rides is limited to Tron and Guardians of the Galaxy, which are great, but that's the only real difference in the last 7 years. The cost of food /drink on the park is ridiculous. Disney have also stopped doing refill cups, boosting the cost massively for the average family trying to stay hydrated. Mobile booking does save time, but  for the less organised the food queues are huge!Standard parking is now $30 per day, with no discount for a half day.  Disney could learn from Universal here, who offer free parking after 6pm.The new virtual queue policy makes things very difficult for families. I found myself waking up at 6:45am just to get into the Virtual Queues at 7am.  In fairness, we did join the 1pm virtual queue a few times but the boarding times tend to be late in the evening, committing you to stay in the park later than I would have liked.Unfortunately, we also ended up having to pay for lightening lane multi passes too, which is an added expense for a family of 5.  We quickly found that wait times for all of the popular rides (especially in Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom) were 60-90 mins in the standby queue, which is no joke in 30 degree heat.Overall impression is that Disney is dated and poor value for money for families. The current set up forces families to plan everything with military precision, just to reduce wait times, which is just added stress. For those of you planning to wing it on arrival, you should prepare to spend most of your holiday queuing up.All in all, we had a nice time, but for me Disney World has lost the magic!",Planning Tips
"Our family of 7 had a great time but I am docking 1 star due to the prevalent line cutting issue.I had not been to a Disney resort in over 10 years.  Went to Disney World Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Disney Studios.  We enjoyed all the parks with the exception of the long lines.  We experienced line cutting in all parks and all lines.  The ""cheat"" was as follows: a group would have one person placed in line and then  30-40 minutes later the rest of the group would use a cell phone to cut their way to the front part of a one hour line and meet up with the plant in the front part of the line.  We saw 1 up to 8 people at a time in every line using this method to cheat the wait, over and over again.  Almost every line.I chatted with a Disney rep while in line at Disney Studio and was told Disney allowed guests to leave a line to go to a restroom and when they return, a cast member would walk them back to their place in line.  Never did we see a cast member with anyone cutting the line.I have since tried to contact Disney via email concerning their line cutting issue but their response is ""eyes closed.""  No one likes waiting in 1 hour lines and the line cutting will only get worse if not addressed. I might recommend all use this cheat method to cut the line wait time, but I cannot imagine the chaos that would ensue if everyone did this.",Customer Service
"We loved Disney world, it was one of only a few places that my husband was able to participate in rides and attractions with our son. Sad to say we are canceling our Christmas trip and going to stay at Universal instead because they no longer care about people with disabilities. The things they are asking individuals like my husband to do are humiliating and degrading. Either pay more money for lighting lane or wear an adult diaper‚Ä¶ very disappointing.",Accessibility Issues

I made it quite clear that we‚Äôd never had a problem in the past, or at DLP or at Universal where we were going the following week and that she has had a diagnosis since she was 4 (she is now 14). The cast member said there was nothing more she could do and suggested Genie+ at a cost to ourselves. I sent 3 emails to disability services questioning this, none of which were replied to and also 1 to guest services, again this hasn‚Äôt been replied to.

"Well, I know that this review will not change anyones mind about visiting but here goes..We have been to Disney before and enjoyed it. However, wife has limited mobility, but will not and I mean not use a mobility scooter or wheelchair she does not want people to look at her as disabled, she can cope but it hurts. We have used Disney's visit the ride then come back after a time to go on the ride, this has been removed for adults as of the start of July. We were offered a wheelchair costing 50 dollars, a scooter costing 75 dollars or we could use the genie system for easier access costing between 30 and nearly 200 dollars.All of which made Disney more money. My wife has not got better since our last visit in fact she has gotten worse the staff really had no interest in her pain or any empathy for her conditions. We were told they would raise our concerns about her treatment in the morning meeting, dont believe they cared enough to do that.I would not have preprdered tickets for Disney if I had known how she would be treat. We went 4 times to the Disney parks over 2 weeks, the last time we visited we went 9 days.Embarrassed Disney believe that this is the way forward, hope Disney get a hold on this and start treating people as human beings instead of cash machines.Really disappointed.",Accessibility Issues

"We have been visiting Disney World for years and found the company to very super supportive in terms of disabilities. However, on this visit our Autistic son was denied a DAS card and we were told other family member(s) needed to wait in line and then rung him to say get cast member to bring him to the front.  Autism comes with communication difficulties, so I cannot leave him on his own, which means leaving my daughter in line in her own. This means it‚Äôs not a family holiday - as one or more has to wait alone pretty much all day. The DAS system worked fine.. You don‚Äôt skip line, you just come back later and get to stay together as a family.  Come on Disney, get your act together and be the inclusive company you claim to be. Even wheelchair users not accepted into DAS system. My son was accepted on the U.K. disabled pass system and the US system Universal make you do, despite all the hoops and stress Disney still refuse pretty much everyone, even if you were previously accepted. We are happy to provide proof but they don‚Äôt allow you that option.

"Disney disappointed me this time. It's frustrating to be constantly reliant on your cellphone throughout the day when you're supposed to be relaxing on vacation. The lack of clear signage in the park is a letdown, and having to schedule appointments for each ride is inconvenient. I advise against purchasing the Genie service as it's almost useless. If you book a ride that's two hours away, you can't reserve another one. If a sudden opportunity arises, you have to cancel the original ride, book the new one, and risk missing out on your preferred ride later. Disney's digital connectivity requirement lacks charging stations, unlike airports that offer numerous options. You'd have to pay $30 for a portable charger when your phone dies, leaving you stranded without access to rides or maps. The only solution they suggested is a change coming on the 24th with the Genie. This experience was so disappointing that we're giving up on the remaining two days of our four-day tickets. It's too exhausting to spend a full day dealing with these issues, heat, rain and ineffective cast members. I will say Andy at the Magic Kingdom saved me.  Our phone went dead and he had the sense and ingenuity to print us hard copy tickets and access our Genie and help us with bookings we can follow with a hard copy ticket and just knowing what time it is. Thanks Andy. The rest of the day was a mess!",Customer Service

"My family has visited Walt Disney World many times since our kids were little. Our first trip as a family was in 2003. What a fantastic time we had and couldn‚Äôt wait to go back! Had reservations in 2020 which was cancelled due to Covid. My daughters booked a trip for  my husband and I to celebrate our 30 th Anniversary. Was I shocked how Disney World has changed! I honestly could say I did not enjoy myself due to inflated prices, lightning lanes and Genie plus! The food was great in the past but now so overpriced and tasteless!! They cater to the DVC members but forget about their other paying customers. The magic is gone! You can‚Äôt even enjoy just watching a parade because you are constantly looking at your phone! The Magical Express from the airport to the resorts was fun for the kids and hyped them up for your trip! Not anymore! Value resorts now cost the same amount as deluxe resorts did in 2014! Really? The special things that Disney employees used to be able to do to help create the magic is gone! If you want anything special you will pay a high price for it! I wanted to do the priority seating for fireworks at Magic Kingdom but the price from 2020 (which I had reserved) to 2024 has skyrocketed!  My daughters came with us and I am glad we didn‚Äôt do the priority seating because you sat on the grass if a chair wasn‚Äôt available! I will get my wine and desserts elsewhere and watch the fireworks on Main Street while being hearded like sheep! So sad that once a fun, family friendly vacation has turned into an expensive fiasco!! Walt would be soooooo disappointed!! Shame on you Disney!! Don‚Äôt know when or if I will go back again! They lost the Magic!!!!",Staff Friendliness
"Epcot CenterWe were at the park on July 4th, 2024. The fireworks show was spectacular, however, we were not aware that the parking lot was going to be closed after the show. Consequently, we ended up going to the boardwalk which is far away from the parking lot where we had parked our car in the morning. When we realized we were taking the wrong direction, we tried to go back, but then we were informed that once we had left, we were not allowed to return. Our only option was to take a shuttle to one of the Disney World hotel resorts, and then take a second shuttle back to Epcot Center. It took us around 2 hours to be back to the parking lot. When we got there, it was 11:30 p.m., and we found a young lady wandering about the vacant parking lot, totally by herself, trying to find the spot where she had parked her car in the morning. She had gone through exactly the same experience as we did. Being terribly concerned about her safety, my husband and I asked her to get into our car, and we drove her by the security area, where she could at least find someone to walk with her until she could find her car. Epcot Center needs to do a better job informing people about what happens when you stay for the fireworks shows after the park closes at 9 p.m. In addition, there was not any signage about the two different exits: one to the parking lot and another one to the boardwalk, which has nothing to do with the park. We had a beautiful day at the park, but arriving back to the hotel after two and a half hours, when it would have taken us just about 20 minutes, was really stressful.",Accessibility Issues

"Just don‚Äôt bother. Disney used to be quality in every aspect. From rides to dining to costumes. Not anymore. So many rides are ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù with motion simulations via a screen and a seat that jiggles the rider about. I could stay home and sit in a bouncy chair for that experience with a VR headset and save a fortune. Why would I stay in an overpriced noisy hotel room for rubbish food and coffee I don‚Äôt get to have UNTIL 0700 that is ridiculously expensive and weak for that matter, just to be jostled around in a chair in front of a television screen? Cheap out rides. Awful. The wigs on the costumes for the princess were laughably wretched. Party City had better quality costumes. The mermaid tail on Ariel was horrendous. This is a company that made the American theme park a destination and the costumes appear as though some soccer mom whipped them up for her children for a Halloween trick or treating party last minute while hopped up on copious amounts of candy and caffeine. The shows and parades were hilariously bad. To the point of irony. I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or laugh harder. Disney isn‚Äôt paying their employees enough for the embarrassment they have to endure on the daily to be put through for these poorly choreographed performances. Some group of CEO‚Äôs are rolling in the money while every corner has been cut in the park. It is evident from this visit.

This was meant to be a once only time, however after returning to the UK its seems we are planning to go back and do a  month  long trip!We absolutely loved animal kingdom and found it was more chilled than the other parks. Tiffin restaurant food was definitely not theme park dining it was on another level absolutely delicious. As was the Nomad lounge.  We took a bus from Animal Kingdom to the Animal Kingdom lodge, beautiful place going in the daytime it was so quiet as everyone was at the park. No queue for Donald meet and having a beautiful meal at saanna restaurant while watching a zebra eating his dinner was magical. As was sitting on the outside balcony in the oversized rocking chairs watching the animals on the savanna,  incredible. Loved epcot! Guardians of the Galaxy it a must ! Insane ride in a good way.

Completely ignored me and my request, Left me stranded, We visited Universal parks in Nov 2023 and never had a problem with cast members or handicap services.

Additionally, as someone with a chronic illness in the skin cancer family (yes, we still deserve the opportunity to enjoy venues like Disney world) the lack of covered walkways in these areas to and from the buses was highly frustrating.  There was also a sore lack of covered areas for guests once inside the park and on these three particularly rainy days, this was challenging, to say the least.While I realize that if there were more seating areas available around where the evening shows at MK and EC are displayed, chaos would abound, sitting on the ground isn't a great option and after walking around all day, it's much easier to enjoy these shows seated. More benches would be nice.For a place that does such an amazing job of offering a great experience inside, it's very tiring and frustrating to get from park to park or park to hotel.",Park Cleanliness

"Walt Disney World and Bob Iger need to rethink how they charge and treat families.  We had a really bad experience at Magic Kingdom today and guest relations lied to us about our choices with the lightning lane issues we were having.  No only are we charged a lot of money for tickets but we have to pay for lightning lanes too, even though they don‚Äôt make any difference to wait times.  What happened to giving us the freedom of the old fastpass with our ticket purchase?  It worked better and cost nothing extra.We have also found in the years that we have been DVC members that the benefits have diminished to very little, we no longer get free parking at the parks or extra magic hours, instead having to be a guest at a premium resort hotel (which we failed to get any hotel for the duration of our trip, so couldn‚Äôt use our DVC points either)!!We won‚Äôt be coming back and we have decided to sell our DVC contract as the magic is gone and we are bitterly disappointed with the lack of empathy and help from guest services.Wake up Disney - you‚Äôre losing families because you are getting greedy.",Customer Service
The new DAS system is horrific! They will not accommodate any physical disabilities not even Parkinson! Worst of all you have to purchase the non refundable tickets to even apply. Unless you have severe behavioral issues they will not accommodate you. They say they have more staff so you can leave the line and come back but that‚Äôs a lie. Someone has to stay in line. Therefore if you are a caregiver with just a party of 2 you can‚Äôt leave to take care of the person with you needing assistance! The only way to get faster lines is to pay for the ride and then fight to get it on the app ..,Accessibility Issues
"To keep this review short and to the point I will only mention a few disappointments. But it‚Äôs still Disney so overall the trip was great. We stayed on property. 1.  The Genie Plus/LL/virtual cue requires you to get up at 7am. There is no way to prepurchase (or even know the cost) in advance. Do not plan on sleeping in even if you wanted to. Learn to use it before you go. It is complicated to figure out on the fly. 2. For us the Genie was worth it for MK but a complete rip off for HS. We only went to those parks. HS did not have many attractions we wanted on the Genie plus and the return times were all late afternoon, limiting its use. We bought the individual LL for Star Wars RoR (that was worth it). 3. MK needs to refresh their bathrooms so they are hands free. Also water filling stations would be nice. They just have old fashioned water fountains that make refilling a bottle very difficult. 4.  HS seems to have no theme. It‚Äôs a combination of Disney Jr., big box Disney and old Hollywood. There were a few rides we liked but generally did not enjoy this park as we ran out of things to do and decided to leave the park and come back in the evening for the Fantasmic show. 5. The Be our Guest Restaurant (MK) was surprisingly good. The service was great and we enjoyed most of our food. 6. The Buffet breakfast at HS was so subpar I can‚Äôt believe we paid so much for it and package that provided certain seats at Fantasmic. Overall Disney just needs to upgrade/modernize a few basic features and it will continue to take our money.",Park Cleanliness

"My wife and I retired in 2023, and the first thing we wanted was an adult trip to Disney.  Made all our reservations and got there in November.  We stayed 8 days at the All Star Movie resort this trip.  We've stayed at a different spot each time we've been (7th trip, including family trips with our kids).  Long lines for some attractions, but we were used to that. We tried several new restaurants and a few favorites from past trips. (separate reviews on Trip Adivsor).  Our only major complaint was that breaksfasts in the Disney restaurants was that they were bland, dull and subpar.  The staff in those areas were always helpful and professional.  The same could be said for all the Disney Cast Members we met were pleasant, polite and very helpful.  We definitely recommend advance planning for all aspects of your Disney visit, from trasportation to and from, lodging, and a plan for visiting the parks with meal planning included.  Sunscreen, comfortable footwear and clothing appropriate for the weather is a must.  We'll be back soon.",Planning Tips
"Second trip here (been here in 2018 before all hell broke loose in 2020). This time to celebrate my birthday. Parks are excellent. Stayed at Pop Century - Skyliners were the best. Went to Hollywood Studios for the first time.Three complaints, though. Since COVID-19 and Bob Chapek‚Äôs bad business practices (he‚Äôs canned now, thank God!), there has been some changes that I do not agree with, and one thing my mom has been complaining about is the Genie system. The system is broken: it costs money for Genie+, unlike the old FastPass+ system; you don‚Äôt get to select rides way in advance, like before you check-in; and Lightning Lane books out way too easily, making you wait in the Standby Lane for almost an hour or more! They really need to reinstate the old FastPass+ system - it‚Äôs much easier!Also, another complaint that really doesn‚Äôt affect me (we drove from Alabama), but gives other people hell: booking flights with Walt Disney Travel Company directly, and the Magical Express. Those two got the axe by Chapek (another one of his bad business practices). I really wish those two can come back, because it makes it convenient for people who just want everything in one package. Maybe even resort luggage delivery and resort airline check-in (the old vendor, Bags, went bust so I think it‚Äôs time for Disney to start providing luggage delivery and resort airline check-in on their own to replace Bags)? I hope so. It would be very convenient for those who don‚Äôt want to haul luggage on their own. I highly doubt the new Magical Express service will be complementary unlike the old one, though.My final complaint: package pickup at resorts. This really needs to come back. I went on planDisney and asked about it, and their answer seemed very promising, but I do hope it comes back for the next time I visit the resort again. If Disney can afford to bring back resort package pickup again, they can certainly bring back Magical Express and start their own airport luggage service to go with it as well.Other than those complaints, the resort is great! Got lots of birthday wishes, and the restaurants I went to even acknowledged my birthday with special desserts. You gotta love Disney! They care about their guests!",Planning Tips

"We crushed 3 parks in one day and it was easy with teenagers. Here are my top 3 tips:1. Stay in a Disney Hotel (or check into one) - we didn't actualky stay in an official hotel but it's worth it to enter early and be able to purchase the Single ILL passes at 7 instead of 9. Don't get fooled into an affiliate. Hotels like the Drury get you early entry but NOT early purchase. 2. Start at Animal Kingdom - this park opens at 8 instead of 9 so early entry starts at 730. Arrive at 715 amd go straight for the Avatar ride. No passes used. 3. Study the Genie rules amd app - the app is everything. If used properly you don't need an expensive guide. You can do this!!! Know the order of your rides. Watch the wait times. Go go go. Here are a few more :4. Buy preferred parking - then take your car from park to park. The one time purchase transfers to each park. Keep your receipt. 5. Without a doubt buy the Genie pass. It's 29$ and if used properly you never wait and get to ride everything. 6. Our order was AK, Epcot, MK but could have easily substituted HS for the latter two.",Planning Tips

"Place is a scam for Worlds Dance.  If you don‚Äôt stay on the property you pay a $400 commuter fee.  If you stay on the property (350/night plus tax regular room) you have e to buy at least one day at a park (another $500 for 3 people) that you have little time to go to.  Pay for Genie plus to ‚Äútry‚Äù to get on a ride and find people just walking through the line.  In addition for the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù rides, instead of waiting for 70-100 minutes you pay another separate fee of $17-$25 per person because per the Disney app chat person ‚Äúthey are very popular‚Äù.  Which means we can charge you another fee if you don‚Äôt want to sit in line all day.  Bottle of water $5.50, which is cheap as well.   Asked to get a refund for Genie Plus.  That went about as well as the $8 domestic tap beer.  Person indicating because we used it ‚Äúonce‚Äù there was nothing that can be done.  While telling them 3 difference scenarios on what happened with people walking through without scanning.  They asked for ‚Äúnames‚Äù.  Yes I pay attention to the names..No not really.  I won‚Äôt get into the ‚Äúother special fees‚Äù.    I would suggest going somewhere cheaper like Hawaii.  Cheers",Customer Service

"Disney is a magical place in many ways. The rides, hotels, and restaurants are, for the most part, great. My complaint which has leads me to the two star rating is that over the years they have cut a lot of the benefits from staying on site down, such as the bus transportation to and from the airport and the free magic bands while continuing to increase prices and nickel and dime you with paying to cut the line.  We are dvc members and it is difficult watching Disney slowly take things away. My other complaint is that vacations are supposed to be relaxing. Of course Disney vacations are never completely relaxing because you were running around a lot but forcing people to get up at 6:45 in the morning to make their genie plus and lightning lane selections definitely makes it much less relaxing. The technology and the technological requirements to manage your day in the park is getting ridiculous. For five days on my vacation I had to get up at 6:45 AM to book all the genie plus and lighting lane selections for our entire family. It was hard to go to sleep afterwards.My last complaint is regarding the public transportation around the parks. It seems to be getting worse, except for the gondolas. The wait times for buses at the contemporary were ridiculous  and the monorail broke down on us multiple times. I know Disney can do better and they need to reevaluate the Disney app in the genie+ system.",Accessibility Issues
"Take nothing away from WDW - it remains a great vacation spot, but ‚Ä¶.Having spent the past 6 days at all the parks I have a number of observations/ conclusions:1. Don‚Äôt both with Genie+ as you need to buy it before you know what availability you can get and you can‚Äôt book next attraction until you are on the first ride . We booked our first ride 12 seconds after the 7 am start and got our first slot at 1130 . By the time you can book your second ride times are into the late afternoon / early evening. Ok if adults but no good if you have young children 2 . WDW is packing more and more punters in who are already paying hefty admission ticket prices in the knowledge that you are unlikely to do more than 2-3 popular rides in a day . Conclusion - don‚Äôt expect to spend any more than 60 mins on attractions out of an average day of 10 hours. 3. Lightening lane guests have huge advantage ( they have of course paid for it ) . Stood for 109 mins at Frozen attraction in Epcot and would estimate that lightening lane guest through put was 100 times than of standby guests. 4. WDW have made their App all inclusive which is great if you are there for long stays or an IT guru. The App is confusing and over complicated. In conclusion I would say that WDW has undoubtedly put profit ahead of guest satisfaction and this will remain until large enough numbers of guests make their view known .",Planning Tips
"We paid for Disney Gene+, We paid for individual Lighting Lanes, We got there early, We stayed late. I have gone to Disney many times but now all the Magic is gone.  Disney Gene+ was $35 and we got to choose TWO RIDES. Only One of those choice was what I wanted. Second one ???? there is no other good choice left as everything was sold out. We started making choices from 7AM (earliest possible time) and still could not even chose TWO rides of my choice. Disney over sold Gene+ and with that we simply could not get the ride we wanted even with extra pay $$$$. Some line up exceeded waiting time of three hours. We paid $25 per person for Rise of Resistance at Hollywood Studio. We were given 8:30-9:30 slot which conflicted with firework time. We were finally on the ride and it stopped. We had to get off the ride and walk down the stairs. With some fight, we got park hopper ticket to come back next day. Customer Relation told us we got $400 upgrade but I argued what actual benefit did I get at all when I didn't intent to come back to that park next day and now I have to spend extra time to come back and waste time.

"We used to love visiting Disneyland in LA, and we have been to Disneyland Paris a few times, so we were so looking forward to Disney World.To say it was a let down, was an understatement. For a start it is too big, big is not always best and this certainly isn't. We were used to short queues to get into Disneyland LA and Paris. We were also used to parking very close by, but it was an hour before we even got into the park, as there were two queues and a Monorail queue, just to get into the park. We were fed up before we even started.The other thing was the park itself. It seemed to be in decline and we were used to everything being clean and tidy and in working order overall. This wasn't the case. One of the gents toilet was blocked when we arrived and hours later the same toilet was still blocked. I was pushed out of the way as a woman rushed to the toilet in front of me. The second time I used the toilets most of them had no locks on the doors. They were just generally really shabby,I can say for sure we won't be back anytime soon, if ever.",Park Cleanliness

"As an annual pass holder, I‚Äôm done with this place! I know I‚Äôm only one of millions of people that visit Disney. And as a pass holder I‚Äôm stuck with this monthly bill till the end of my yearly contract. But I as well as my family will not be renewing or going again. First, I pay about $2000 a year just to be a pass holder. Then when I go, I have hotel/hotel parking fees. Which depending on the place could be a large amount.Second, being a pass holder gives you absolutely NOTHING! You can‚Äôt use it for food, beverages, or anything you truly need to survive there. But hey you get 10% off of stuff that you‚Äôll never need or want unless MAYBE it‚Äôs your first time there. Third, fast pass is a joke! You pay even more money to skip the line‚Ä¶.IF you wake up at 5am and start clicking like a mad man for two hours to get on the one ride that will most likely be closed for some reason, which you‚Äôll then have to cancel that and then have to do your best to go on something you could care less about or keep circling back to the app or the ride to see if it‚Äôs open only to go back to trying to use the fast pass and you might be able to get on the ride before the place closes. Lastly, don‚Äôt ask one person who works there for help!  It‚Äôs like they are trained to not help you in the most helpful way possible. They point you in 20 directions. I got the run around at Hollywood Studios. One person said go ‚Äúthis way‚Äù then about half way to my destination I asked someone if I was going the right way to a customer service tent (because surprise the fast pass had to be pushed) and that person said to go back ‚Äúthis way‚Äù which is where I just came from. Long story short. Fast pass = waste of money. Being a Florida resident/annual pass holder is a year long suck and doesn‚Äôt give you anything but a monthly charge. Oh and if you stay at either an overly priced ‚Äúon property‚Äù hotel or one locally, make sure you plan to spend more money than you did to even walk on the premises. I‚Äôd give a zero if I could.",Customer Service
"We are a Disney family but were disappointed at the complex new ride reservation system. Very much a money grab. However, once you've paid so much to be there from out of state, you do it-- and it was certainly worth it during the Christmas rush! If we hadn‚Äôt paid extra for Individual Lightning Lanes, we would have waited HOURS for Tron, Rise of the Resistance, Guardians of the Galaxy and Avatar Flights of Passage. All of those rides were new and AMAZING. Loved the new trackless rides like Rise of the Resistance and Ratatouille. Genie Plus was worth it everywhere except Hollywood Studios, where the top rides (Slinky) sold out before 10am. We stayed at Pop Century for early entry and the Skyliner, and those worked out great. Things we rope dropped: Hollywood Studios-- Tower of Terror (great as always!), Epcot-- Ratatouille, long wait, worth it!  Animal Kingdom- Expedition Everest (favorite roller coaster).",Planning Tips
"During our visit, we stayed at the Yacht Club. We loved the room, location is close to the transportation center, walking distance to Epcot, boat ride to Hollywood Studio, Swan and Dolphin, and several other places close by. We had the 5 day hopper pass, which was much better years ago. You must plan ahead where you go each day and even half days. We enjoy dining in the finer restaurants, and if we want to go to Be Our Guest with reservations, you have to use a half day hopper pass. This makes your dining cost more. We were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary since we came to Disney World for our honeymoon, and Disney was celebrating 50 years also. I wrote to all of the executive officers about coming for our anniversary. The letter was not acknowledged by any but instead forwarded to an HR woman. We didn't get a congratulations discount on a meal, gift basket, or anything. This was at least our 12th time staying in Disney World at a resort and going to the water parks, Hoop De Doo Show, other fine restaurants, and all the parks, with our family of 6-8  which was all mentioned in the letter. Evidently, the HR department and Disney don't care how many times or how much money you spend as long as you spend on them. Sadly, Disney World is not the same family place. It has gone downhill, and Walt would be disappointed.",Customer Service

"Ok so it's very expensive to get in but once you spend a day here you can see why, we hired a stroller for our 4 year old and it was a godsend and so easy to just park up whilst we went on rides and enjoyed activities, the place was busy but didn't seem too bad, the longest we queued throughout the day was about 45 minutes so we didn't bother with the fast pass apart from the 7 dwarfs ride which was 90 minutes and that was at half 8 at night but well worth it, we caught the parade which was amazing, the fireworks show was incredible, so much to see and do, we didn't get around the whole park so I'm guessing we'll just have to return, we had such an amazing time, I thought it was magical, made even more so by the reaction of our boy, the only downside which I think Disney needs to address are queue jumpers, people will blatantly just walk past saying they need to get to a family member or you'll see them just climbing over barriers, absolutely disgusting and rude behaviour by some people",Event Experiences
"Walt Disney World remains a magical place, but it is an undertaking that requires a significant amount of planning, and it is incredibly expensive. It can get crowded with painful wait times for rides, it is suffocatingly hot throughout the summer, you will drop thousands of dollars on the trip and your kids may end up enjoying playing in the pool at the hotel better than trying to tackle the parks. With that said, there are ways to maximize your experience at WDW and after a dozen weeklong vacations here over the past 20 years, many with children and several with just my spouse or exploring solo, I would like to share some tips. 1.Choose the right time of year to visit when the parks are not overwhelmed with visitors. Avoid all holidays and school breaks especially the week after Christmas and coming during spring break. Additionally, summer is too hot. January through early February, late April-May, and mid-September-early December are best. There are excellent websites and apps with crowd calendars predicting crowd levels at all the park throughout the year. Some parks are less crowded on specific days. The website Touringplans is what I have relied on. 2. Stay on Disney property. Yes, it is more expensive than off property, but it gives you access to the Disney transportation system, allows early entrance to the parks and you can purchase individual Lightening Lane tickets beginning at 7am rather than when the park opens. The Deluxe resorts are amazing but are priced at a ridiculous level. The Value Resorts are the least expensive but are the most crowded, bus wait times can be long, and they lack the ""magic"". The Moderate Resorts give you the most bang for the buck. Theming at the Moderate Resorts is terrific. 3. Get up early, arrive 30-40 min before rope drop and head to your must-ride attractions right at opening. I realize this is no way to spend a real vacation, but this is Disney, and it needs to be approached differently. This will automatically save you 2 hours of standing in line that day as you can probably head to a second popular ride after riding the first and have a manageable wait as others are still arriving at the entrance gate. 4. Understand the System. Become familiar on how Genie + and Lightening Lanes work and make full use of these systems to stay one step ahead. Accept that you will fork out big bucks to fully implement but don't try doing a busy day at Disney without these tools. Incorporate Park Hopping into your plan. Start at one park and as it gets busy hop to another park that has a lower predicted crowd levels that day.5. Make table service and character dining reservations well in advance. Some of the most popular need to be made 6 months in advance and you better be ready to book right at 7am. 6. Come with a Plan. The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World is the bible for anyone planning a trip to Disney. Read it cover to cover. Many other excellent websites packed with information can be found. Hit the busy rides first thing in the morning or use Genie +/LL. Less busy rides are for the afternoon when the park is most crowded or...7. Take an Afternoon Break. This is especially important if you have children. If you are arriving at rope drop, either you or your kids are going to lose it if you try to stay the whole day. In the late morning as lunch approaches, leave the park and ride back to your resort (another reason to stay on Disney property). Eat lunch, have a swim or take a nap. Come back refreshed in the late afternoon and evening to enjoy the rest of the night. You can use the park hopper option to head elsewhere that evening.8. If you have young children, meeting the characters and getting photos and autographs will be the highlight of the trip and will create unforgettable memories. For preschool kids, this isn't someone in a costume. They are meeting the real Mickey Mouse or Cinderella. Make sure you save plenty of time for these encounters. Epcot World Showcase is a surprisingly great spot to meet characters as there are less kids here and plenty of opportunities. Make sure you do at least one character meal. Pooh and friends in the Crystal Palace or the princesses in Norway at Epcot are both great spots.If all of this seems overwhelming, you should think twice about coming here. This is what today's Disney World demands. There is no room for spontaneity. Only clean, well-organized and efficient fun and a willingness to drop a lot of cash. However, if you can handle that, WDW can still be ""The Most Magical Place on Earth.""",Planning Tips
"Save your money.  We took our kids 30 years ago and had a blast.  We took the grandkids this past weekend and rides we wanted to go on were either ""temporarily unavailable"" or you had to wait 2 hours in line (no seats) for a 2 minute ride.  Definitely not worth the money.  Food was way overpriced.  It rained the days we were at the park and a dollar store parka cost $10.  They should have been giving them away with the billions of dollars they made last year.  Corporate greed.  Shame on you disney - it's all about the money and not the guest experience.  I will give them credit for the pleasant employees we met.  They were well trained for customer service.  I also give them credit for allowing customers to bring their own snacks and water into the parks.  But beyond that it was a total waste of money.  We went to ride the rides and the ones we wanted were either unavailable or spend 2 hours waiting in line.  Will never recommend to anyone or go there again.  It was pure torture!!!",Customer Service
Need to update the Map/Guide books with the updated information. Also the numbers they use on the map should be on the actual building to be identified. Should have a better plan for Disney Princess meet up. Each park should have all the princesses in 1 building so kids can enter from one end and meet all by the time they get out‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very difficult to stand to meet 1 or 2 Princess and wait each time 1 hr plus. Should open at least 1 Halal Zabiha restaurant each park; as good amount of Muslim tourist will be accommodated and happy.,Planning Tips

"Since we have to rely on our phones for our Disney Experience App why are there no free charging stations or outlets throughout the park. I didn't think that the Magic Kingdom was magical. Almost every ride was having mechanical issues and the lines were 2 hours long, unless you had a lightening pass, but buying them will put you in the poor house. I was able to get into a queue once and was given a time at 8:30 when we were leaving the park. We couldn't  stay because we wouldnt have been able to catch  the bus to our hotel. I may consider returning to Animal Kingdom my favorite park.  There were issues with line jumpers. There were a lot of scooters and people who were using them as race cars.

"Listen!! Keep your expectation low and don't try to do to much. We have been to Disney World several times in the last few years and this is what I have learned. Pick 3 or 4 must do things per day. If the rides that you want to do are popular, rope drop in the morning to get those out of the way first. Genie Plus is worth the money if you hate lines. Watch a few YouTube videos on how to use this option. Don't stress and let the magic happen!!",Planning Tips
"Sorry to say but Disney World has lost the magic. I have been visiting the parks with my family for over 40 years and it has been really going down hill recently. I remember when cast members were friendly and would greet you in the morning and wish you a good night at the end of the day. Now your lucky if you get a ‚Äúhi‚Äù. Most of the time they are rude or yelling at park goers for various reasons. The park is dirty, paint flaking off railings and walls, mold growing on rides and ride buildings. You simply wouldn‚Äôt see this 20 years ago. Just a poor job of maintaining. Feels more like a money trap than a magical experience, pay for your tickets then pay more to skip a couple lines(used to be free) and if you want to skip the premium rides, pay an additional fee on top of the ticket price and other genie plus fee. Upper management are probably currently dreaming up even more ways to get even more money out of people. If the experience met the price I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this review.

"I have been to Disney several times before and read the reviews prior to going recently.  The reviews reflected terrible experiences people had at Disney but I just could not believe that this could be true.  Unfortunately my family's experience was so disappointing.  This is not a place for families and especially children.  How does Disney think that waiting in line for 60-120 minutes is OK?  People were not happy at any of the parks we attended, visitors or workers.  We used Genie plus and Lightning lane and payed extra for rides or we would have only been able to ride 2 or 3 rides per day due to extremely long lines.  We reserved a ride at Magic Kingdom only to find out the ride was not working and a very non-chalant employee told us ""it should be working by end of day, lightning lane is nonrefundable.""  The wait times listed on the gates and on the APP were inconsistent.  The app time would say 20 minute wait but the actual time at the gate was a minimum of 60 minutes.  What is Disney expectation for a child?   This requires all adults to be planning three steps ahead. Plan to mentally exhausted or save your sanity and leave the park. If you want to be able to look up from the app and see your family, it's not an option. Save your money and avoid the memory maker pass. All photo ops require you to wait in line. Some of the photographers are fun and engaging. However, many seemed tired and disinterested. It seems Disney has increased the volume of all themed music in their parks. This is likely due to mask the sound of crying children because they have spent their entire vacation waiting in a line.  I now agree with others, the Magic is gone.",Customer Service

"The most disappointing trip everBeen to Disneyland before so we thought to try disneyworld. We stayed off property and had a 4 day park hopper ticket and got genie + every day. The days at the parks were bad. Wake up at 6.40 and wait to refresh to get in virtual lines and still missed out on tron. Couldn‚Äôt buy lighting lines until park opened. Once park opened they had all sold out. Genie + was giving me time slots for 11pm and this was a 8 in the morning. Lines were all 2 hours plus. The parks were dirty - rubbish on floors, graffiti on gems in snow whites ride, toliets outdated. Food was a let down - love a good churro but 7.20 for a cold flavourless one isn‚Äôt cool. We ended up leaving the parks after 2pm most days since we couldn‚Äôt be bothered lining up for 2 hours and were over being shoulder to shoulder with every man and his dog.",Park Cleanliness
"Don‚Äôt buy your magic kingdom or other park tickets as part of a package. Disney markets it as a convenience (for them), but it actually creates more stress for you. After tackling the tram, the boat, a long security line and then another long line to show our tickets, we were instructed to go wait in the guest relations line to ‚Äúactivate the tickets.‚Äù And then repeat the ticket line. We had never had to endure this extra step before and were totally baffled. After inquiring, we were told that this was because we bought the tickets as part of a package (on the Disney website). Super helpful ‚Ä¶ We will clearly never do this again. This was a terrible, unwelcoming start to our trip and made us miss our first fast pass.

The Christmas parade and Minnie‚Äôs firework show was spectacular but it was just far too busy. I had read they only let 20k in but it was a LOT busier than that. Needless to say we only managed one ride because if we had queued the 80 average minutes per ride we would have missed the parade and fireworks.  We even managed to get a virtual queue for Tron but when we turned up for it the ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô queue was out the door and would have meant us missing the parade!

"The Walt Disney World Resort is a massive complex consisting of 4 main parks, 2 water parks, and lots of golf courses and resorts. I've been to all of the parks and water parks when I was younger and I've been to Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Hollywood Studios as an adult. These parks are massive and endlessly entertaining and they really do make you feel like you're in another world, which is quite a feat in today's day and age. Yes, they're expensive (exceedingly so actually - staying at the Polynesian Resort is more expensive than staying in actual French Polynesia), but if you can get past that you can really enjoy the whole experience. And there are definitely ways to cut down on expenses. We've never stayed on resort as there are several very nice hotels that are just outside the Disney property that are more affordable. You can also look at a lot of the souvenirs online and pick out things like Disney ears ahead of time so that you're less likely to impulse buy excessively (which will happen anyway). Planning a Disney trip is no easy task and it's honestly sometimes harder than planning a huge road trip, but you can make it less stressful. Since we've been to Disney several times within the past few years, I'll give you some tips:1) Get Genie+. I know it seems like an extra cash grab (and it is), but you don't want to be spending extra time in line for rides if you don't have to. You're already spending a lot for the ticket price and it won't be as enjoyable of a time if you have to spend more time in line than necessary. It's like the airline checked bag fees or concert booking fees that are now ubiquitous: very annoying, but not much way around them. Make sure you budget that into your ticket price and you won't be shocked when you buy it. Also, really think about if you'd use the park-hopper option. The parks are pretty far from each other and you'll spend a good amount of time just traveling from one to the other. This may be a good option if you only like some things in a particular park, but we typically spend all day in one park. 2) Make sure to get the app for your phone. All restaurant reservations and Genie+ reservations are done through the app, which makes it invaluable. You can also see estimated wait times for rides, which makes it easier to strategically plan your day or quickly change the plan if a ride breaks or has an excessive wait time. You can also mobile order food/drinks at several places and that alone can save you a lot of time. Make sure to bring an extra charger for your phone though as the app tends to drain your battery.3) Don't over plan. This is the biggest thing we've seen that leads to the trip going awry. Yes, you often have to book some restaurants months ahead of time (they open 60 days in advance) in order to get a reservation (looking at you Be Our Guest) and yes, you have to get Genie+ ride reservations, but you don't have to over plan more than that. You don't want to forget that this is an amusement park and that the point of coming here is to have fun. We typically pick one sit-down restaurant for the day, then try to get Genie+ reservations for our top 1-2 rides, and then wing the rest of it. Most of the fun is wandering around and seeing what you can stumble upon, whether thats food/drink, shops, or rides. 4) Don't try to do everything. There's no way that you can do everything at Disney and trying to cram everything into a trip will increase your level of stress and won't let you really savor the moments at the park. It's also a ton of walking and you'll probably be exhausted after a day or two, especially if you're not used to walking 20k steps a day. If you're coming for a full week, I would budget in rest days (or rest half-days) to make sure that you don't wear yourself out.These are only a few tips for Disney World and there are numerous blogs out there with more detail than I could ever include here. Things can also change frequently, so I would recommend looking at some of those closer to your trip for the most up to date information. Overall though, don't forget to have fun and be a little kid again. Everyone, no matter how old, has an inner child, and this is a place where that inner child can come out and play again.",Planning Tips

"For a first-time visitor, I'd say it is a magical place with so many adventures to be had and memories to be made.  I think in general, between all the parks, you can get a taste of the entire world by traveling just here and spending 3-4 days.  That's impossible anywhere else.  Despite visiting on a very busy holiday weekend, there was still plenty of opportunity to get on key rides we wanted and take in all the shows, shops, and food we could handle.  It just takes a bit of prep work in the weeks ahead of time.  One little tip (since entire networks are dedicated to that)... early park entry based on your hotel really does matter.

"Nightmare booking - spend 2 hours trying to book tickets for my family. Super stressfull. Tried all credit cards. My wife signed up and did the same - even signed up for a paypal account. Not luck - no help from chat bot - only it explained the problem. We live at a street in Denmark with a special Danish letter √Ö and as Disney checks the address connected with credit cards we could not pay as the website do not allow the letter √Ö. We had to show up and pay at the gate - but we could not get fast pass, so we waited maybe 3 hours in lines. What the F‚Ä¶. Suggest you go to Universal instead much better park.",Customer Service
"I was at Disneyland January 23/24 with my husband and my 3 kids (13,11,9).When switching parks (leaving Disneyland Park) on the 24th at 8:30pm, we had a horrific experience. I have ALS and cannot speak or use my legs/arms.I have to use a power chair to get around, attached to a speech machine I use with my eyes. If you know someone with a disability, you know nothing is ever easy. You are constantly figuring out how to adjust given the current circumstances in front of you. The handicap exit was blocked off for no apparent reason with a worker standing in front of it. My best guess is that she wanted everyone to go through the gate to count, so the staff member told me to go through the regular exit. I did, and the 2 automatic doors closed in on my legs as I was just trying to go through, digging in to them-I have pictures and videos-leaving a gauge and lots of bruising. My kids jumped towards me and started trying to pull the doors off me. The staff member saw this and started yelling at my kids to stop because they would break the gate. They kept trying because they saw the fear on my face and knew I couldn't do or say anything about it. My husband then said, ‚Äúdo you want a broken gate or broken leg.‚ÄùThis was all horrible, but the shocking part of it all was the staff. The lady continued to fuss at all of us and just very rudely said I should've gone slower and that was the problem, as I tried again it still didn‚Äôt work! My husband had to physically drive me through-his theory was that the sensor wasn‚Äôt catching either my height or the doors only allotted enough time for a typical person, not a handicapped slow moving person like me. Then she just turned her back and ignored my husband and caregiver as they tried to talk to her. She knew we were upset and didn't want to deal with us so she called someone else over. Jian came over and basically said he heard what happened and didn't know what we wanted him to do about it. ‚ÄúDo you need medical attention for your injuries ‚Äú he kept repeating. My caregiver told him that acknowledging how poorly it was handled and how rudely we were treated along with an apology would be nice. Stone cold he said, ""OK, I''m sorry. And I will speak on her (the other staff member) behalf and say sorry for her. It was pathetic. I just turned around and drove off in amazement. I didn‚Äôt feel like Jian really ‚Äògot it‚Äô either, unfortunately and I didn‚Äôt have my speech machine to communicate.There were two problems in my opinion. The first one being a power wheelchair or any wheelchair should never have to be required to go through the automatic doors, this is exactly why the handicap opening RIGHT NEXT TO IT is there for. Secondly, the situation could have gone entirely differently had she just responded differently upon seeing my kids holding the doors from crushing my leg. A simple ‚Äúoh my gosh how did that happen, I am so sorry that happened! Here let me show you so that never happens again ‚Äú would have diffused the tension.I've always been a huge Disney fan and have LOVED Disneyworld trips in the past. In fact, this trip was gifted to my family by Team Gleason Adventures, an ALS organization that aids families in making dream trips/memories a possibility. Of all the places, I chose Disney for my trip. To say I was disappointed in Disneyland's staff is an understatement. In fact, there were many occasions on this trip that the Disneyland staff was cold and not helpful at all. The exact opposite of what one would expect from a company like Disney whom prides itself on customer service.I'm trying to get this word out to as many people as I can. I'm hoping that there would be some accountability for the Disneyland staff regarding the way they treat people with mobility disabilities because I have heard this from multiple people regarding their Disneyland vs their Disney world experiences since this trip. I am not recommending this trip to others in my situation. I typed this whole email with my eyes and has taken me several hours, but I really feel like it is worth my time so that hopefully no one else has to experience what I did and also hopefully the staff will be better equipped on handling special circumstances.",Accessibility Issues

I‚Äôm writing as a very frustrated and disappointed mother of a 44 year old man with several major disabilities.  He is completely deaf and almost fully blind and has numerous other physical challenges.  He has a service dog that guides him or he uses a white cane and has to hang on to one of us.  We have come to Disneyland numerous times in the past and he has always had accommodations that have made for a wonderful time.  Due to his disabilities this is the only family vacation that we go on that he can enjoy.  Even though he can‚Äôt see or hear he gets the thrill of the movement.  When we went to disability services last night to organize a disability pass for today we were told he did not meet the criteria for being unable to stand in a line up.  Disneyland has changed their disability access program to only include those with autism or other cognitive impairments.  We were told our son could sit aside with a family member and meet up at a point along the way.  We are here as a group of 7 and we decided this would once again ostracize Ryan so we would all stay together.  So we did and it was a very frustrating day as he stumbled through the line ups and we all felt frustrated.  Just imagine for a minute being in an hour long line up and having no sensory input!  Their new disability pass criteria is absolutely ridiculous and needs to be changed!,Accessibility Issues
"Such a great, amazing experience! We got two-day tickets both days with lighting passes. Expensive, but worth every penny. If you‚Äôre a first timer like us, we highly recommend that you spend a whole day at each park because there is so much to see and so much to do, each park honestly deserves its own day to appreciate all they have to offer. Disneyland has more rides, but less adventurous ones, California Adventure has less rides but of course, the iconic Incredicoaster which we loveddddd. Such a fun, amazing experience!! We went mid January and there was still so much foot traffic, but can‚Äôt expect too much out of that. We missed the fireworks on both days because each day we went the fireworks were at the opposite park, but the World of Color was soooooo beautiful it made me emotional lol. I loved every minute of both days!",Event Experiences
"We visited  during Christmas week and have mixed feelings about our visit. While we absolutely love the parks, most of the rides, the characters, and history of the park, we detest the Disney greed. They demand an arm, a leg, and your first born for ticket cost nowadays,  and we feel like they nickel and dime us with the extra fees. We purchased the Lightning  Lane Pass for the multiple days we were there and that was a mistake. Definitely not worth it for more than one day and the price just went up another 10+%. The issue is that not all rides are eligible, and then rather than allowing one to plan the whole day in advance and pick all the rides at once, one has to wait 2 hours after picking the first ride and so on. The main Star Wars ride is not eligible BTW, and one has to pay extra on top of the Lightning Lane Pass (the cost is almost as much as the LLP just for one ride). The food is awful no matter which place you pick, and the best place to eat is Starbucks and that is not saying much as it is mediocre at best. The popcorn was burnt, and the only snack worth buying is the churro. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. We remember having far better visits at Disneyland... I'm sure old Walt wouldn't be happy with our experience at the park the lat couple of times we visited. We will visit less often if this greed and lack of better organization continues.",Park Cleanliness
"Our family, 2 grandparents, mom,dad and 2 young children, age 6 and 9. visited Disneyland the 2nd week of December. We had breakfast in our hotel, Best Western Stovall Inn.  A short walk to the park. The park was very crowded. Long lines for the most popular place rides. We went to both parks over 4 days. The rides did disappoint. We had made dinner reservations for the 4 days. My wife had to use a powered scooter which was hard maneuvering in the crowds. The staff at all the rides were very helpful with my wife. The trip was expensive but we new that going in. It was the crowds that surprised us. One thing my wife and I did was take 50 yr. old menu, from the Blue Bayou that we were given in 1974 on a vist. The manager was surprised to see it. All in all we had a great time and would go again.",Accessibility Issues
"We had 3 days at Disneyland Jan 13-15, 225 with two kids ages 8 and 10. We rode 55 rides in three days with a single park a day and lightning lane. We say over a dozen characters and ate once a day at the park, TicketsüéüÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏èWe had originally booked a good neighbour package and then cancelled due to the fires. We ended up rebooking and still going but staying at a closer hotel. We had trouble rebooking and spent hours on the phone with Disney. They were helpful but just painful their system gives Canadians postal codes an issue and box numbers for payment. Because of that we had a few issues at check in each morning as we had reservation dr codes and ticketsSecurity‚ò∫Ô∏è‚¨áÔ∏èWe checked in to the park each day from the east side gate (Toy Story drop off) and stayed at the Hyatt house hotel 3 blocks south. We never had to wait more than 3 minutes to go through security. It was definitely slow season. We went for rope drop daily and stayed until 12-1 pm then went back between 6-7 pm The only issue we had was they took mySelfie stick the very last day I didn‚Äôt even remember I had in there the whole time we went through. You can take coffee and water and snacks into Disney. We did as we went straight 2 hours of rides from 8-10 am without any breaks to maximize the short lines Foodüç± ‚¨áÔ∏èWe loved the churros, the pretzels were not hot and fresh, we ate at horseshoe and it was ok, we did Mobile pick up snacks into toontown and they were good but 5 mini donuts was$6, we ate in cars land at flos diner and that was the best meal of the time in Disney. Downtown Disney we ate at the bowling alley and that was really good and reasonable price (shared a pizza and burger) and then we ate offsite at Tony romas (ok) and Cheesecake Factory (great) We picked up some snacks at cvs and 7-11 and target. lightning Laneüî•‚¨áÔ∏èWe maximized this. We watched a YouTube video on it (just search lighting lane Disneyland and the first guy comes up is Parks guys) and we used his tips. We booked all the rides that broke down and got magical select experience tickets that came in handy later at night when the lines were long and we wanted to ride rides again.Disneyland ‚ù§Ô∏è‚¨áÔ∏èWe did two days here. Monday and Wednesday. First day we did 16 rides and saw 5 characters. We did rope drop Monday and went straight to Tomorrowland. Star tours was broken so we got a pass for that walked on astroblasters, then walked on space mountain. We did autopia, no,  and bobsleds all before 10Am. Then we headed over to galaxy and did that area before taking a break until evening. We felt by 1 pm We were hungry, tired and our feet were getting tired (18,000 steps by 1pm!) so we we r back each day until after dinner. If you don‚Äôt do the show at 930 you can walk on rise resistance. We were too tired but used LL for Indiana snd big mountain and a few other rides again. One tip is to watch those select multi pass tickets from broken rides. If you break down mid ride get a new pass as they are good for almost all but rise resistance. . If you pre book a LL and the ride goes down while you‚Äôre waiting you get a select pass which wasn‚Äôt good for all. Like Roger rabbit broke down a lot but the select ticket wasn‚Äôt good for space mountain or materhorn or Indiana jones. Indiana jones and space mountain have no LL left by 6 pm I found so make sure to book those earlier. California Adventure  ‚¨áÔ∏èüòçWe did rope drop daily and had a game plan and quickly pivoted when everyone went to cars in California we decided to do Pixar pier and rode 10 rides in 2 hours. We ended up doing single passenger to get on cars within 15 minutes at night and then didn‚Äôt again when the line was only 20Minutes. We enjoy webslingers a lot and the girls love goofy flight school (rode it 5 times!) and soarin and symphony swings. My youngest wanted to do incredible as - I screamed the whole time but I survived. The things we do for our kidsWe never did guardians of galaxy as we all agreed that wasn‚Äôt out jam.  Mater was so fun we did twice and of course Ariel is classic and the Ferris wheel, inside out was down for refurbishment.",Planning Tips

"Disneyland was great. So many unique experiences and some of the attractions, they go all out for Christmas.  You may think some of the rides are the same attraction as they share the same name but most are very different. I will say if you're coming expecting to wear your magic band don't bother. It's far less convenient then it is in Disneyworld. Staff in general while really nice were lnt acknowledging you or welcoming you like they do on Disney World.Food choices while expensive were quite the variety and service was quick.Star Wars Galaxy's edge is much better for the character meets as they are strolling around all the time same with just regular characters.",Seasonal Events
"We loved the park, it is iconic being the original park and knowing Walt Disney walked around here, you have to love the history along Main Street, looking at all the names of Disney legends on the upper shop windows. We had five day park hopper tickets for both parks and as we were visiting from the UK and hadn't been for nineteen years this was a special trip for us, we also had photo-pass as part of our ticket and we purchased magic bands which made it so easy to scan for photo's and rides. Because we had five days, we could stroll around and take our time and we didn't have to rush from one thing to another. We enjoyed trying different snacks and treats and enjoyed looking round the shops.It was Halloween time so the park was decorated for Halloween and we managed to have photo's taken with Mickey and Minnie in their Halloween costumes. The Disneyland Castle is charming, and the park has a special atmosphere. The only negative was the crowds which we expected, but in Adventureland especially, it felt so crowded it was uncomfortable and we tended to avoid this area especially at night.We loved that the park was open so late, and we could go back to our hotel and come back easily if we needed to. The area of the park that was so amazing was Galaxy's Edge, just walking into the area is indescribable, the details in the land are spot on, and you are immersed in the Star Wars story and experience. The Storm Troopers patrol the land and we saw Chewbacca and R2D2 and the Mandolorian, roaming around.The other highlights were being in the park in the evening after dusk, riding Haunted Mansion dressed for Halloween and other iconic rides, meeting characters, and trying great snacks and food. We hope we will be able to come back and we would love to do a trip in December to see the parks dressed for the Christmas Holidays.",Seasonal Events
"Disneyland during the Holidays (mid November-early January) is the best. It's so beautiful and lit up and full of holiday cheer. Great food, characters, rides, vibes. We love it. It's important to learn all about Lightening Lanes in advance and to get there 1 hour before the Park opens so you are in the best position to get on all the major rides early. We do that every time and we never have problems with long lines. Love the holiday parade and fireworks and world of color show.  Love eating at Bengal Barbecue and Docking Bay 7 and baked potato at Troubadour Tavern - and the popcorn and churro toffee are something we always get - and churros too.  We love nigh time lights on Disneyland Main Street and New Orleans Square and at Cars Land in California Adventure.",Planning Tips

"It is what you make of it. On a good day, it is busy. On a trying day, it is insanely crowded and shoulder to shoulder with strangers. We knew we would not get to do all of the rides. We decided to pick 1-2 rides that we each really wanted to do and then take joy in Disney magic. When crowds got suffocating, we sought refuge at restaurants, treats, Tom Sawyer island, Tiki Room, Mark Twain River Boat, and train. We played games, trivia, and enjoyed treats while waiting for rides. I wish it required less planning. Kiddo wanted to hold my hands and hug and sometimes I had to pull away to book rides. But, we had many special moments. We did not over plan. We did not try to fight the crowd for fireworks or shows.  We tried to avoid crowds and saw the fireworks  at different corners of the park. Some guests were not nice, but most people were kind. Bathrooms were dirty at places. There are so many people and the cleaning crew couldn‚Äôt keep up but it is fine. I have seen worse bathrooms before. I do wish Disney didn‚Äôt pack the park so much during the busy times. The park is absolutely magical at night with all of the holiday decorations. It is not the park I remember from the 90s but I feel that we can still have a great time and my kid was enchanted.

"I would not advise to do this without the help of a Disney planner. Even with a written itinerary from a seasoned agent, Disney parks is no joke! Is it busy? Of course it is! It‚Äôs the most popular attraction in the world for families and adults alike! But if you‚Äôre there to truly immerse yourself in what Disney has to offer, you will have a great time. Lightening lanes were useless in my opinion, with stand-by lines often having shorter and closer wait-times than if you booked a lightening lane for an hour or more away. 60 minute wait times for certain rides were difficult, especially with children. Disney should consider how to make such rides more functional for the amount of visitors they have daily. Cast members were inconsistent in nature, with some providing curt/incorrect location directions vs staff who would go out of their way to walk us to where we needed to go. Disney should have more signs available throughout the parks to help families more easily navigate the parks and to take additional strain off their cast members. Though a map is made available, it is not user friendly if it‚Äôs your first time. I only noted on our second day that you can use the location tab on the mobile app to see where you are and how to get where you need to go. This would have saved us so much time and energy. Bathrooms in the park are well kept. There were at least 2 cleaning ladies in each bathroom I entered who were consistently making their rounds from stall to stall to keep it clean and well stocked. Well done! We went for the Holiday season and it‚Äôs an experience we will treasure forever. The fireworks brought my husband to tears while the parade had me equally in tears.

"We visited on 3 occasions over our week trip to California.Our first visit was on 1/10 to Oogie Boogie Bash.  We entered the park at 3pm to make good use of some time before the party starts to get on some rides and have some photos taken.  Once it hit 6pm we explored the character trails - with high hopes we actually felt disappointed - the best trail was for Oogie Boogie and Dr Doofenschmirtz, these characters were very engaging and took the time to make an effort.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Sid and Ernest de la cruz.The parade was good but very short and rushed.  CM's handing out candy too busy talking to each other to interact with guests.  Compared to Mickeys not so scary there was not as much candy handed out.We were impressed with Disneyland however noted very long lines - for everything - drinks, popcorn, food, toilets and rides.  Even the Genie+ queues were very long.  In some parts of the park you felt sardined walking shoulder to shoulder with other guests.We spent one more day at DCA and the queues were better - but it is noticed for rides the majority is genie+ and then one family from standby queue. We did not bother with Genie+ as some of the queues looked bigger for this than stand byDisappointed no fireworks at either park during our visit.Overall a very nice park",Event Experiences
"Too crowded! They say that late September is a good time to go. HA! It was packed. Having been to both Disneyland and Disney World, we think the Magic Kingdom in Orlando is far better than the one in Anaheim.The physical space of Disneyland is much smaller than the Magic Kingdom and you really feel that crowding. Lines and stroller parking are on top of each other and it makes it hard to get around. We went during the Oogie Boogie Bash (a nighttime event at the California Adventure Park) and that made the crowds increase especially in the afternoons. The Cinderella castle is smaller here than Orlando, too. We did pay for the Lightning Lane and used it. One other disappointment was the fact that there were absolutely no shows, musical presentations or theater type events planned in the park.We saw very few characters for kids!Just disappointed since it was less than magical.",Event Experiences
"If the park consisted only of the Star Wars part and costed half the admission, this would be a five-star review. But not so. Most of the other rides feel dated. What's worse, you can see the beancounters behind everything, calculating whether they can provide even less content to sell you even more merch. The parade on the day we visited lasted all of three minutes, and there were no fireworks. Bottom line: If you are really into Star Wars, go for it. If you are really into Disney, consider Eurodisney, which is much nicer. If you are in the region and want cool rides, go to Universal.",Event Experiences
"As a long time Disney Fanatic, our recent trip to Disneyland was very disappointing. I'm writing this in hopes of getting the attention of the Disney People who can institute change and return this family favorite to its original glory.  Crowds are a part of the Disney experience, however, when rides and sections of the park are closed for renovation, or one park is closing early, visitors are forced into small spaces meaning there are fewer spaces for people to rest and recharge. What's worse is the difficulty with getting on a ride. With the price of tickets exceeding $114 (though advertised at $104) and pushing towards $200 during higher demand, you admission no longer guarantees anything: maybe only 1 or 2 rides (with 90+ minute wait times if they will even allow you to wait! We had repeated experiences where we were told the wait lines were closed!), no place to sit, and poor access to parades and shows. But here's the catch: you can pay an additional $30 plus dollars per person to get the opportunity to make a reservation for a ride. But even the additional purchase doesn't guarantee much of anything since you need to know how to access the ride reservations through the Disneyland App at preappointed times. In addition, eating with my family was very difficult. Little ones do not want to sit down for a meal and fast food service was hard to find. And, to grab some quick snacks were costing us $60 to $90 for my family! So here are the challenges: For my family of 3, the tickets and parking cost about $400. Food cost another $200. Souvenirs, well, that was another $200. This trip cost just under $1000 all in. We could say Disney needs to charge these prices to pay their bills, however, is that really what's going on? I ask this since the concept of Dynamic Pricing seems to dominate. Dynamic Pricing determines the original cost of the tickets, somewhat dynamic pricing for the cost of the add-on privilege to make appointments for  the privilege of riding as the cost of the add-on varies depending on when you buy it. Also, we found restaurants were also using dynamic pricing. It seems that Dynamic Pricing is a politically correct term for gouging.I could keep going but working families will know what I'm talking about. Time was that anyone could go to Disneyland and enjoy the day next to families across all socio-economic classes. Things were presented equally with equal access. Now, thanks to false advertising for ticket prices, Disney has created a social class system that denies those with fewer resources less access to the fun.",Accessibility Issues
"The first and oldest Disney park. What we were not aware of is that at this time of year there is no parade or fireworks, just a light show. Obviously, we should have checked on that, so our fault. My family and I have always enjoyed the Disney Parks and this was our fifth Disney park. We had hired a car in San Francisco  and driven to Los Angeles and based ourselves in a hotel about four miles away. Due to problems with taxis we decided to drive to the park. The traffic was very heavy at the entrance to the car park off the West Ball Road and it took about 20 minutes to get parked.Once inside the park we had a great time although 100 minutes queues did put us off a few things, As it was supposed to be a quiet time of year we did not purchase fast track passes. Overall we did enjoy ourselves, but the projections onto the buildings on Main Street at night were obscured in places by the trees.If you are a Disney fan it is still worth a visit, but do your homework better than I did.",Planning Tips
"My first experience in a Disneyland. I was so surprised by how nice the atmosphere at the place is and also by how nice all the staff members are. Even bigger surprise was that the place is as much for children as for adults. If you want to explore everything, this is surely not a one day visit place. But then, considering the price, I would definitely recommend to buy the premium ticket for a day and then to learn a bit about the attractions themselves and the attraction reservation system in advance. I believe that paying a bit more for premium ticket pays out, if you know how to use it and what specifically in the park you are going for, as this give you a bit of advantage.",Planning Tips

"Don't get me wrong, we had a great time here. Seeing attractions like the famous Matterhorn and all of the original Fantasy Land just like Walt designed it was great, but man, this place gets packed. Because it's old and they have limited amount of space, they do a great job of making queue lines and attractions fit everywhere, but walkways and passages are more narrow and get clogged with people rather easily, especially during parades and shows.However, once you get out of the main hub part, it opens up and isn't as bad. The best part is Star Wars: Black Spire Outpost. I think I could have easily stayed there all day just to take it all in. Rise of the Resistance is one of the best ride experiences I've ever had. We got lucky because it had broken down, but had just opened up as we walked back to that area, so we only had a 15-minute wait. I also can't express enough how awesome it was to build my own lightsaber. It's pricey, but I highly recommend you do it if you are a Star Wars fan.Overall, I am happy that we went (even though WDW is closer) we spent a full week in the area and did Disney 3 days. One at DCA and two here since we needed two in order to see and do all that we wanted to.July probably isn't the best time to go with the heat and the crowds, but it worked out for us ok.",Planning Tips
"Nice to be at the original theme park but it is smaller than I expected, queueing was actually well managed and surprisingly short, the fast pass was only $30 (great price) and the group of 30 teenagers I was with had a great time. The light show in the evening (fountain and light show at the adventure park)  was nowhere near as good as I have seen before at other Disney parks",Event Experiences
"For the 4 of us (2 adults and 2 children, 4 and 11 years old) it was the first time we went to a Disney park (we also received a badge at the entrance in this regard). From the moment we entered the park, we felt that we were in a wonderful, magical place. Compared to any other park we have visited, here you feel that you are entering a different world, that you are entering a story and that you are part of it. We paid 846 dollars for all 4 (entrance to the Disneyland park with Disney Genie+), and the parking is about 30 dollars more.The youngest (4 and a half years old), was able to enter 90% of the rides.Disney Genie+ robs a little of the charm of the park, because you always have to keep an eye on the app and schedule the next ride, but it's worth it, because it reduces the waiting time and you can try more rides.Good food in restaurants, very friendly staff, clean toilets, quite crowded, fun and good mood everywhere.The fireworks and the light show are MAGICAL.The prices in the park's stores are quite high ($30 a ear headband, $110 a sweatshirt, $70 a backpack, etc.).We can't wait to go to another Disneyland park to enter the magical Disney world again.",Park Cleanliness
"Wow! Where to begin. Great place for the entire family. Total themeed emersion in the different lands and on attractions. Each land and attraction tells a different story. We went to both Disneyland (DL) and Disney California Adventure Park (DCA). Two days in each park is ideal so you can see everything each park has to offer. In DL My 8 and 10 year old loved Rise of the Resistance and Smugglers Run in Star Wars Galaxy Edge. In DCA I would not miss Radiator Springs Racers, Incredicoaster and Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout. All and all so much fun. A lot of walking so where comfortable shoes.",Planning Tips
"I‚Äôve been going to Disney for a long time and it‚Äôs always the best! I def have a different experience to others as I am a childless twenty something who went with my friend for a day. Disney is expensive but I‚Äôm only paying for myself so it‚Äôs fine for me price wise. Families on the other hand, I get why it‚Äôs off putting ($$$!!). We paid $250 for a park hopping ticket and luckily we were able to do almost every ride in both parks in that time. It was my first time using Disney Genie and I was sceptical at first as I miss the old fast pass system but I was pleasantly surprised by it. For $30 I thought it was worth it and I‚Äôd def use again. We were able to plan our day well using it, booking slots in line with no issues or long waits in between. If we went in peak time that might not have been the case. The range of food Disneyland has is great, I could easily spend the whole day sampling everything they offer. Some of the rides are a bit old hat, but also some have the most impressive, hands on, action packed rides with high tech animatronics and visual effects. The new Mickey and Minnie Runaway Railway ride is fantastic!!! They really are unmatched. I love Disneyland üè∞",Planning Tips
New Star wars rise of the resistance ride is worth the long walk. The Lightning pass for 30 dollars per person per day makes a big difference on the wait line.Our family with a  teenager enjoyed the following ridesin the order of preference:Tomorrow land¬†Star wars  continues simulator in tomorrow land near Astor orbitor - 6Autopia - 6 long line and if the previous person is slow your experience is bad Astor gun orbit - 6Millennium falcon smugglers run - 7 simulator with engg.

Advice: Others avoid buttons and focus on the simulator in the front which is great.¬†Star wars rise of the resistance -9¬†this is new and awesome but a long walk as it is to the end of the park and you have to come back as the loop was closed but worth it.

"This park has seen better days. It has muted colors, old rides, and overpriced everything. The Rize of the Resistance works every 4th day. There are now a bunch of rides closed for repair, including Space Mountain so check with the park. It was $200 for an adult ticket with the Genie pass (new name escapes me) and half of the rides were greyed out and wouldn't let us reserve! And the food at Disneyland is horrible. The only thing decent is Rontos Burgers in Star Wars land. I went to Disneyland Tokyo and the cost was $50, the employees were so nice and helpful, the food was amazing, the park was immaculate, and it was a thousand degrees and everyone was happy! THAT was the happiest place on Earth. Disneyland needs to start to justify the insane prices $250 when I was done with parking and not even food yet! How about you take some of this money and make better food, paint the entrance, and make it worth your astronomical price tag? When you boil is down, there aren't any rides worth going to anymore.",Park Cleanliness
"Disneyland never seems to disappoint we took our grandkids and her 3 older children down there to visit in July. We knew it was going to be a little on the crowded side, but it was well worth getting the family together and going for a visit. We were able to visit both parks for 2 days and just about complete everything that we wanted to complete what we were there. Disney makes things very enjoyable even though it still very expensive to go. So, save your pennies, nickels, and dimes. Having a gap in using the app to get around makes things a lot easier we did have some very good meals while we were down there. Golden horseshoe review, lamplight lounge, Carnation Caf√©, Caf√© Orland diner, and snacks throughout the park. If you plan out your trip you can really get a lot done again using the app on your phone helped us, make any reservations for the rides that we wanted to go on.

"I spent the day at Disneyland by myself and was able to enjoy 14 rides in one day! I walked 27,000 steps and was there from 8 AM till almost closing. I listened to the podcast ‚ÄúDisney Deciphered‚Äù on Spotify to get tips for how to maximize my time. The park was very clean and the rides were great. Some of the magic was missing, however. When I drove into Toy Story parking, the attendant was very rude to me - almost yelling at me for pulling up at the wrong spot. It was not a happy way to start my Disney experience. Pirates of the Caribbean was closed as was the haunted house. I knew that before going in from the Disney app. Indiana Jones was broken when I went to it after waiting for my lightning line pass time frame. I was able to return to it and enjoy the ride, although it broke down/halted twice while I was in the ride. Being stuck in a dark ride, strapped in, and not know how long you‚Äôre going to sit was somewhat stressful. The sit time was likely only a minute or two, but I (and others) were uncomfortable with it. Regarding the app, I would have appreciated more outlets to power up my phone since you really need your phone at all times at Disney. When I asked about where to plug in my phone, again, one of the staff was very rude to me and told me I had to buy a battery pack. Disney should provide more outlets for phone charging. Water bottle refill stations were hard to find, and when found, lines were long. With temperatures rising to the mid 80s, they really should provide more freshwater for people. I know they want to sell water, but the reality is most people bring their own water bottles. I did appreciate the fresh fruit stands (delicious grapes, apples, and pineapple) and healthy food options at the park! Well done. I missed seeing many of the characters walking around. Interaction with characters is one of the things that makes the park so special. They can really brighten your day and bring a smile even to adults like me! I missed seeing them casually interacting with people. There were a few photo ops with characters, but lines were long.The staff at ‚ÄúRise  of the Resistance‚Äù were amazing. They were in character and courteous at the same time. Additionally, staff at the Disney welcome gate were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. These little touches make a big difference. And with the sticker price of a park ticket + parking + lightning pass fee for not waiting in line at ‚ÄúRise of the Resistance‚Äù + food + lightening pass for other rides, I spent a pretty penny in one day. It was magical, but not what I remembered, or what it should be for the Disney brand. Disney can do better by ensuring all staff are trained and tested with their five star Disney level customer service. Lastly, one thing about the app is that people will bring their phones out and record rides and shows. This can block your view from actually experiencing the ride or the show. ‚ÄúWorld of Color‚Äùwas an amazing show. If I go again, I would pay for the dessert experience so I could sit at a table and watch it. I signed up for a virtual queue for the show at 12 PM, for the 9 PM show. It really was wonderful, but slightly annoying because the people in front of me were recording it and were blocking a portion of my view. The phone‚Äôs glare detracts from the magical experience. I would suggest Disney encourage people to not record rides and shows at night. I also went to Disney Adventure Park and one of the riders (in front) was recording the incredible coaster ride while riding. I thought this was pretty dangerous and the person next to me was freaked out about it. Disney should pay attention to this trend.",Planning Tips

"Havng visited Disneyland in California 3 times previously, Disneyland Paris twice and Disneyworld Orlando we thought we knew what to expect. We were wrong.Parking cost at $35 was comparable to other theme parks but even arriving reasonably early in the morning we were parked on the roof in full blaze of the sun - there is no option to choose one of the other multi-storeys with room under cover, you get what Disney decides. The queue for security and then the tram transport to the park was poorly organised and crowded. There was no shade until you get past security and lots of adults and children were clearly uncomfortable in the heat even well before 11am. There were 3 empty trams waiting so it wasn‚Äôt clear why the queues were at a standstill for over an hour with more people constantly joining the crowd.Entry into the park was however quite easy once we got there and we sailed through the gate no problem.Getting around though was a challenge as the park was so crowded despite having to book our reservation in advance due to Disney‚Äôs limited guest number policy. We struggled to see how it could possibly be limited numbers - you could barely move in the park.We had Genie + tickets but you can only reserve one ride at once with a delay of 90 mins to reserve a second. Most of the popular rides such as Matterhorn, Indiana Jones and Space Mountain were already booked up to late evening by lunchtime. You can‚Äôt use Genie+ on Star Wars Rise of the Resistance without paying extra which seems a bit of a con (same in the orher park with Cars Radiator Racers) and the wait time nver dipped below 175 minutes all day. We went on the other 2 Star Wars rides instead Star Tours and Smugglers Run however they are almost identical to each other and a waste of 2 Genie passes.Pirates of the Caribbean was closed the day we went with no explanation which was hugely disappointing being a favourite ride of ours.Thunder Mountain, Autopia and Space Mountain were superb as ever. We wanted to do Finding Nemo but the queue was horrendous at 75 mins and Genie+ was all reserved. We did 8 rides and the monorail in our day and stayed until after the fireworks. Even with the Genie+ the queues were so ridiculously long that it wasn‚Äôt possible to do most of what we wanted in a day.We did notice many rides leaving half full or not running at full capacity- Nemo ride had 4 submarines not being used and only one monorail train was running instead of 2. This all added to the extended waits for guests.Genie+ includes photo pass pics but the only one we got a picture on all day was Space Mountain.Food and drink were pricy but we expected that and what we had was more than fine.Gift shops were hugely disappointing- everything is variations on mouse ears at $34.99 + tax and the same keyrings and soft toys in every shop - where are the character items of old that were so beloved and a proper souvenir ? We didn‚Äôt see a single character walking round all day - they were only on the parades or had to be queued for. Queue jumping was a huge problem- every ride large groups of Americans (never other nationalities) shoved their way past you in the queue with a ‚Äúscuse‚Äù not even a please or thank you. Lots of folk also jumping barriers from the standby queue to the lightening lane without Genie + once through the ride entrance.  Disney needs lightening pass scanners at each end of the lanes to stop this abuse of the system.Lots of the ride waiting areas would benefit from outdoor coolers like Universal have and additional shaded zones as the sun was often unbearable. Given the money Disney are clearly making a little customer comfort shouldn‚Äôt be too much to ask. The parades were very good though and fireworks amazing, the park was very clean and well cared for with staff constantly picking up litter and tidying. It just felt too crowded leaving guests unable to appreciate the rides, the scenery and get around the park in a day like you used to be able to do.",Park Cleanliness
"This was the first time anyone in my family visited Disneyland Park in California. It was an extreme success, and I would recommend the Disneyland Park California to anyone hesitant on travelling to the park from the East Coast with the closer of the Disney-themed properties being Disney World in Orlando.Let's start out with some background information which I will then pair with our experience with each item:1. We went mid-July, during summer break for the kids.2. This was part of our overall west coast trip; we flew in from Las Vegas, Nevada.3. We spent one day at Disneyland Park, and the other at Disneyland California Adventure.4. We pre-purchased a military three-day park hopper with Genie+.5. We did not have a plan/agenda for the park.1. Our time of visit was in the middle of July which made us a bit anxious in terms of the amount of people that would be at the park due to summer vacation across the country. In hindsight, the weather was hot, but bearable in the middle of July; we should have done a bit more research on this, but ultimately it didn't affect necessarily affect our experience at the park despite all our walking.We did the Disneyland Park on a Monday and California Adventure on a Tuesday. There was still a lot of people, and despite the smaller size of Disneyland Park California compared to Disney World in Orlando, partaking in each area of the park was manageable and was not too overcrowded. We expected there to be a lot of people at the end of the day for the firework show, and managed to secure a spot an hour ahead of time on Main Street prior to people packing in the area (this still seemed better than Disney World Orlando where people appeared to be literally on top of each other when it came to getting some real estate to watch the pyrotechnics).2. My wife did all the planning for this trip which I am extremely grateful for. In her research, she figured that it would be a lot easier to fly into John Wayne Airport (SNA) rather than Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) which is arguably the larger more popular hub. Flying into John Wayne Airport saved us time and money when it came to transportation to and from the hotel via Uber/Lyft (no more than 30 minutes from SNA to the immediate area around the Disneyland Resort area compared to an hour commute from LAX). As mentioned, we were flying into SNA from Vegas so the air fare was not as steep; I'm not sure how that would look like if you're flying direct from across the country. As it works with your itinerary, I would recommend trying your best to fly into SNA.3. We only spent one day at Disneyland Park. We were initially worried that one day would not be enough to see and enjoy the park, but our one day here at the park was sufficient. Now, we didn't get to ride on every single ride (we were able to ride the Disneyland Train, Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Carribean, Millenium Falcon, it's a small world, Storybook Land Canal Boats, King Arthur Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Autopia, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, and Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage: Smugglers Run; walk through Adventureland Bazaar, Port Royal Curios and Curiosities, most of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and Main Street; eat at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo and Galactic Grill; do a dance party and arts and crafts at Fantasyland Theatre; take pictures with Minnie Mouse and get to see R2D2, Daisy, Mickey, Rey, Kylo Ren, Stormtroopers, Chewbacca, Luca, Incredibles (Frozone, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl), Joy, Sadness, Woody, and Jesse; watch the Magic Happens parade and Fantasmic firework show. I know everyone has their own preferences in terms of what part of the park they want to visit, but this for us was more than what we did at Magic Kingdom at Disney World, so by far more of a success to this day.4. The three-day hopper was a bit of overkill, but knowing that we had the option was nice. We were primarily sold on this because of the pricing. With the three-day hopper, we added the Genie+ (soon to change to Lightening Lane) which gave the complimentary PhotoPass. The Gene+ definitely came in handy (make sure you familiarize yourself with it before hand if you can, but if not no worries - it's not hard to figure out; all rides with Lightening Lane's will require that you make a reservation), while we took advantage of the PhotoPass as much as we could (we didn't use it as much as we did compared to our visit to Disney World and all the parks there). 5. Not having an agenda or plan is not our norm, but we decided to change it up in order to make our family vacation as stress free as possible. This so happened to work out for us which was nice as we didn't necessarily set any major expectations.For families with smaller children, I personally feel that you should invest your days at Disneyland Park, while older children and adults may enjoy Disneyland California Adventure a bit more. Definitely well worth visiting.",Planning Tips
"A fantastic three generation family vacation trip to Disneyland was smooth, exciting, memorable and enjoyable. Sure there were crowds but it really wasn‚Äôt too much with the use of fast pass which allowed us to time rides and make the most of our time. We enjoyed the rides, restaurants, activities and fun for all ages. Be sure to make reservations to eat at the Blue Bayou restaurant in advance as this is a must do whenever we go.",Planning Tips
"First time visitor with 10 and 13yo boys.No surprises, it was hot, crowded and unbelievably expensive but we still had a blast.We had a day in each park starting with DLR then DCA. With lighting passes we comfortably managed to do all the main attractions and plenty more even with a break at the hotel both days. Overall the theming and attention to detail is just amazing.There were so many highlights, we loved all the big attractions but Rise of the Resistance, Gaurdians Breakout, Radiator Springs and Incredicoaster were absolute standouts.The parks were very clean including toilets. DLR definitely has more shade, DCA was very exposed in the heat.There‚Äôs a lot of talk about the food but we found most things we had to be mediocre, we didn‚Äôt eat at a full service restaurant.Lighting pass was essential as were the additional one off fast passes, worth every penny. The system does have its flaws though, by early afternoon at DCA available bookings were hours away, then by late afternoon absolutely none available at all. With the coaster also shut all day we had barely utilised the fast pass. Fortunately the coaster opened late in the day and we secured a spot, and it really was incredible.The parks are also completely different in the evening (DCA is really cool) and we had the opportunity to re ride some of our favourites with very short queues.",Park Cleanliness
"I used to go to Disneyland every other year and lately  each time I go the experience gets worse and worse while the prices on the other hand keep rising.  Super long rides for super short rides, angry and tired people everywhere ( both kids and parents). Very few ""genuinely "" happy.   A lot of for the picture smiles that erased right after pictures were taken. Kids meltdowns all over the place. Overpriced food/ toys/ souvenirs. On top of the expensive ticket, be prepared to spend $30 on top go go on a lower wait time lane ( still long wait lines). Most kids visiting are bored at the lines and the ride does not compensate for their misery  waiting in a boring line. ( if they had an interactive or something to look at or touch while waiting).  As a parent taking my child to a temptation land where they have all kinds of toys at the exit of every ride at ridiculously high prices is not my ideal of a ""happiest place"". Bathrooms are too far apart and always long lines ( a park very poorly designed for families where kids might need to go on short notice) Little Kids might need to go pee  while in the 45 min or even longer  wait line. If you dare take them to the restroom and risk not getting back on time, prepared to be fought  by other parents in the lines that do not remember see you take your child out and that  the rest of your party is still waiting for you a bit ahead of the line.  Put on Diapers on your kids. The food was so bad my kids did not eat their pizzas or their hamburgers  and they love pizza and hamburgers. ( I tasted them and they are below mediocre and again, overpriced).  This was my experience as a seasoned goer. I can see how first timers have an even worse time with no signs anywhere and not prepared to be stressed and Mis√©rables on the ""happiest place on earth"". This is the last time we go if they do not do something about it.This place is no longer a place where families can go, escape ""reality"" and enjoy themselves. Its a money squeezing factory where the most important thing is to have you send more money on the least cost.  Not worth it at all. You are better off going on a real vacation to Hawaii, Bahamas or  South America.",Accessibility Issues
"I have issues. First of all Disney is horrifically over priced! 4.75 for a small bottle of water? There are very few benches to sit on. Clearly they want you to keep moving unless you sit somewhere where you have to buy food. Hardly any drinking fountains. The Genie Fast Lane is a joke. We paid $140.00 for it so we could get to the Rise of the Resistance experiment which always had an hour wait time, only to find out that you have to pay an additional 104.00 for four people just for that attraction! Then the next three attractions we went to were closed. Space mountain was closed. They seem to shut down the Matterhorn, Monorail and the Thunder Mountain close every night during the Fantasmic and Fireworks  and shows. They don‚Äôt tell you this. We did get refunded though. However, I had to spend an hour to get refunded. Did I mention the prices? Mouse Ears  34.99? Also the Fast Lane is only for two attractions per day. Incredible parade, Fantasmic and Fireworks!",Event Experiences
Must visit. Need at least 2 days. Both parks are good . Many times 3 days offer goes and that is completely worth it .  If you are not used to walking highly suggest to take at least one day break between 3 days visit . We did easily 16000 to 18000 steps each day on 3 day visit .Must see parades as that is what creates magic. 1 day in adventure park and 2 days in Disneyland are good to cover at leaisure . If you don‚Äôt want small rides then 2 days in total an also enough .After doing Disneyland didn‚Äôt fell great at Universal Studios Hollywood. We felt universal studious can be skipped if short on time and instead better to spend time at Disney . It‚Äôs well worth it .,Planning Tips
It really is the happiest place on earth. We took our 9 & 11 year olds to the park for 5 days. It was the perfect length of time for us. Enough time to see and do so so much yet not feel like we needed to get out and do other things. Get ready to walk a lot! As there is so many things spread out and get there early. Use the app for checking which times are busiest and just have fun.Some of our favourite things were;- Drawing classes at California Adventure- Meeting all of the characters and getting their autographs. - Guardians of the Galaxy ride. - Donald Duck - Making Light sabres.,Planning Tips
"Total disappointment. Disneyland and California Experience are nothing close to what they used to be. One reviewer suggested he  felt like a credit card for the Disney corporation rather than a customer. That says it all succinctly. One of our party of five had to cancel due to emergency work at a major US airport, but Disney would not refund his 3 day ticket, with Genie service added, more than a week before we were going to arrive. The customer is no longer King at Disneyland, Disneyland Corp. is King. Everything, and I mean everything, is not just overpriced, but horribly overprices. Near $20 for four bottle of tap water called ‚Äúpurified.‚Äù Not even spring water. Restaurants serve lots of horrible junk food at absolutely exorbitant prices. We had one lunch at what they might call an upscale restaurant, white cloth napkins and table service, called the Wine Country Trattoria, that I guess you could call fake Italian food. Horrible. Some kind of toast loaded with low grade pesto sauce, $10, that four of us, including kids who love bread, could not finish. I had a shrimp salad that I could not finish because it was so bad. My wife had a tomato salad that was so swamped with salad dressing that it was totally soggy and inedible. Genie pass is hard to use and get benefit from as you are only able to use it for one ride at a time. Disneyland requires a reservation for each day, suggesting they are limiting the number of of people in the park, but midweek, in the last week of June, the park was jammed‚Ä¶overcrowded‚Ä¶ with people every day. Wait for any of the popular rides is far too long. Forty-five to NINETY minutes on almost all the popular rides.  Ridiculous!! Not even enough bathrooms. Waits in the bathrooms almost every time I used them.  This should not be. As a former CEO of a large corporation, I know what service can be and should be. That is no longer visible at Disneyland.Perhaps the real capper, was a survey I received after our first day at the park. It asked a few clarifying questions and then asked if I was happy with our first day. I said ‚Äúno‚Äù  expecting to get some questions on why not, but instead they said the questionnaire was over. That definitely shows how much they care about their guests. Never again! I have been to Disneyland with our children many times and with our grandchildren, two different families, and was always happy in the past.  This stretches back to the sixties and as recently as four years ago. Disney has seemingly forgotten their purpose and how to run what was once a wonderful, fun place to visit.",Park Cleanliness
"We are a Disney Adult family. This is our second time to go to the original Disneyland vs WDW in Florida.  Like the smaller size of the park and the different ride options. But when I was there before, I qualified for DAS pass because I am a cancer patient on chemotherapy and immunocompromised. I cannot stand in long, tight lines of people. With the new DAS changes, I was denied this, citing I could purchase Genie Plus or Lightening Lane which we did but still had to wait in lines for some rides. We got home and 2 days later my daughter was ill and tested COVID positive. I am negative so far, but still quarantined and testing daily. Of all the times I have visited WDW and DL in the last 3 years with using DAS option, this has never happened. We mask in airport, plane. Wash hands frequently, try to maintain some social distance,  The new DAS guidelines are not helping those who need them. Disney needs to re-evaluate!",Accessibility Issues
"We went to Disneyland resort with our three kids using the park hopper. The experience was excellent,  and we utilized the park hopper to switch between the Disneyland Park and California Adventure. We loved the close proximity of our hotel to Downtown Disney and the two parks  Only a few negarive critiques from our experience.  Disneyland offers a restaurant package in which guests can receive a preferred seating ticket to view one of the evening Fantasmic show with a dinner reservation that same day. We booked dinner at River Belle Terrace. The dinner was completely overpriced for mediocre food. Rhere was zero variety of food options for kids. The plates were $55 per adult (over 12) and $30 for children.  Futher, the preferred seating was a scam. You were seated on the flithy ground to view Fantasmic,  and the fencing was a visual barrier directly in your face. This seating location was nowhere near the value for the $350 dinner bill. On the other hand, I recommend using mobile order throughout the park, and we found that Flo's Cafe at California Adventure and Alien Pizza Planet at Disneyland were good value for money especially finding food to appeal to our three kids. We took advantage of the early entry for Disneyland guests at both parks. Make sure you ask a cast member where the entry is for hotel guests, so you do not inadvertently end up in the general line. The experience at Disneyland Hotel was excellent.  We loved the pool, and our room was nice, clean, and the cleaning staff kept it tidy and stocked with towels throughout the week. The poolside food service at the pool was also excellent. Good food and friendly staff. I also utilized mobile ordering at the hotel pool which was convenient. We ate at the Goofy's Kitchen at the Disneyland hotel for a character breakfast.  We found the price to be worth the experience.  The buffet style breakfast was delicious,  with hundreds of options for food and made to order omelets. Your family will have the opportunity for a professional photo with Goofy and other characters visit your table. Staff were very helpful and friendly.  Overall,  I would stay at Disneyland Hotel again in the future.  Just beware of dining options at the park.

"First time back to Disneyland since Covid and my family was sorely disappointed in the shape the park is in now. Dirty bathrooms, rude cast members, inability to handle the simplest logistics. We took a quick trip to Anaheim to visit the park with our 7 and 4 year old and it was a nightmare.1st suggestion: Go elsewhere. Disneyland isn't worth the money, even when they're discounting tickets. Especially with young children. Just lower your expectations and go somewhere like Legoland. Much better bang for your buck. And shorter waits, too. My family really wanted to ride the Cars ride and the wait was down to 60 minutes so we decided to go ahead and wait. 15 minutes into the queue the wait was still 60 minutes. We ended up waiting 2 and a half hours. My wife and daughter bailed because she had to go to the bathroom and they didn't even get to ride. Meanwhile we watched as cars full of single riders just marched on by us. When I raised concern to the cast member, they didn't say a word and just walked away. We almost missed dinner, my son missed the parade, daughter didn't even get to ride the ride. Just a complete mess.2nd suggestion: If you can't escape the Disney mystique, spend the extra money and go to Walt Disney World. Having gone to both in the last few years and experienced them both post-Covid, all of Disney's efforts in parks have clearly been allocated to the Florida resort. If you have to go Disney, save yourself a terrible experience and go to Florida instead.3rd suggestion: If you're trapped into Disneyland, just expect the worst. Lower your expectations as far as possible. Don't eat dinner inside the resort. That was the biggest mistake we made. We weren't sat for an hour after our reservation time and missed just as much time at the park as if we had left. Cast members didn't even apologize and acted as if they didn't care, until I complained openly. It was pathetic.4th suggestion: Don't expect the same bubbly, fun, informative, and helpful cast members. Training and hiring has clearly taken a turn for the worst. We had rude cast members at both parks across multiple days. There were a few decent ones but for the most part they were a disaster. And when concerns were raised, I was met with ""Ok, whatever"" followed by a cast member walking away. We were with friends who have an annual pass and they confirmed that the quality of cast members has declined significantly in the last few years.Just an awful time. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemies. Please save yourself and go somewhere else, anywhere else.  We've been lucky enough to save 2 friends from taking this vacation in the last few weeks and hopefully this review saves you from making the same mistake.

We didn't have hoppers but did have Genie+ which was a must. It seemed confusing at first with the app but once we got into it it was really easy. We got all of the rides that we wanted except unfortunately we waited until the fireworks (9.30pm) to queue for Rise of the Resistance. We were right at the start of the ride, had been through the pre-room when it broke down, not to be reopened that night. That was a huge bummer. As we didn't have a hopper the next day we weren't able to go back and do it. Tip - if you really want that ride either pay the extra or do it in the morning. We used the free shuttles to & from DL & went back to our resort from about 2-5pm then came back to DL until close at midnight. I had one of the best salads I have had while in the USA, a really yummy chicken salad at Hungry Bear Restaurant in Critter Country.

"What hasn‚Äôt been said about Disneyland? It‚Äôs everything that you‚Äôve heard and a bit more. The rides, the convenience to Downtown Disney and California Adventure, the theming, it‚Äôs all fantastic. As someone who‚Äôs only ever visited Walt Disney World in Florida, visiting the original park was a bit daunting. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect when it came to crowds or weather, but I realized that it wasn‚Äôt nearly as important in DL as it is at WDW. Disneyland is a much more relaxed, causal experience. There‚Äôs no need to plan extensively and stress about getting everything done. We arrived at 10am and left the park at 1:00am, feeling satisfied about riding every ride on our list, and exhausted but agreeing that visiting the park was the best decision of our trip. I gave the park four stars because the park needs a little TLC - paint‚Äôs peeling in some places and the rides are a little squeaky at times - but it‚Äôs also kinda part of the charm? Being able to walk from one park, to downtown Disney, and back to the other park was amazing. No need to run from the bus to the monorail to the Skyliner!

"What hasn‚Äôt been said about Disneyland? It‚Äôs everything that you‚Äôve heard and a bit more. The rides, the convenience to Downtown Disney and California Adventure, the theming, it‚Äôs all fantastic. As someone who‚Äôs only ever visited Walt Disney World in Florida, visiting the original park was a bit daunting. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect when it came to crowds or weather, but I realized that it wasn‚Äôt nearly as important in DL as it is at WDW. Disneyland is a much more relaxed, causal experience. There‚Äôs no need to plan extensively and stress about getting everything done. We arrived at 10am and left the park at 1:00am, feeling satisfied about riding every ride on our list, and exhausted but agreeing that visiting the park was the best decision of our trip. I gave the park four stars because the park needs a little TLC - paint‚Äôs peeling in some places and the rides are a little squeaky at times - but it‚Äôs also kinda part of the charm? Being able to walk from one park, to downtown Disney, and back to the other park was amazing. No need to run from the bus to the monorail to the Skyliner! Being open until 1am on the weekends is a huge plus, too, especially since we only planned to visit for one day. We‚Äôre already looking forward to our next visit! Definitely make time to ride a few attraction if you‚Äôre visiting LA, it‚Äôs worth it.",Park Cleanliness
"Guest Services in both California Adventure and Disneyland were excellent.   They all went beyond the call of duty.   We were travelling from the UK as DVC members.    There was a problem with the Disney APP with the DVC part of the app to allow discounts on food.    They had to make a call to DVC member services, and Mindy made it all happen.    The next day in Disneyland the same issue again, and they managed to fix this again.    Alex from Hesperia California and Karl from Torrance California and Mindy (DVC Member Services) were all the people involved.       Karl just a FYI the recommendation for dinner at Storybook was fab thanks again all of you.   As a FYI - some of your food outlets would not accept the DVC discount from the APP but wanted to see the actual card, so there is a lack of information on DVC around the  park.   I hope that helps....... you improve your service.Thanks again.Sue and Robert from Ringwood, Hampshire, UK.",Accessibility Issues
"Had an amazing time at Disneyland California! The attention to detail is impressive, and the rides are fantastic. The cast members are friendly and helpful, adding to the magical experience. Don't miss the delicious food options and the breathtaking nighttime entertainment. Highly recommended!",Event Experiences
Recently went to Disneyland with my family and we had a blast. The food was on the expensive side but the fun rides made up for it. This is a good place to visit if you are looking to plan a family vacation.,Planning Tips
"Slightly mixed feelings writing this review.  I have been going to DL since I was a child and always thought of it as a magical place.  Its still magical but man, the crowds are immense.  I think probably made worse as Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain were down (soon to be Tiana‚Äôs ride) and so having 2 big attractions out would have increased queues elsewhere (note to Disney ‚Äì don‚Äôt take 2 big rides down at once!!).  This time I went with myself and my daughter as a birthday treat (flying from New Zealand) and as we‚Äôd come all that way, we paid for Genie plus and also made use of the paid Lightening Lane for Rise of the Resistance.  We are pretty fit and experienced and so were able to move quickly throughout the park and with big days (approx. 8.30am to 10.30pm) and so could do approx. 18 rides a day.  Key tips from me: - Book a Genie plus (fast pass) ride as soon as you enter the park, even if it is for the afternoon, you can book another one in 2 hours time so keep booking them.  We found we had a great range of rides lined up for the afternoon and evening.  In the meantime, go to the best rides with the smallest queue. - Unless you want to queue, book Rise of the Resistance first thing (it will already be a time slot for the afternoon) - Sometimes queues can seem low (e.g. 20 min) but unless you are close when they announce that you can find yourself in a 60-70 minute queue as everyone has rushed to that ride.  The reverse is also true so use your judgment as to how long a queue is and don‚Äôt be afraid to step out of it.  I didn‚Äôt come 11,000km to Disney to queue.   - Use single rider where possible ‚Äì Matterhorn is a good one for that. - If you can the left-hand side of the Matterhorn ride is (IMO) slightly better that the right, - For a break and minimal queue times The Mark Twain River boat, Tom Sawyers Island and Davey Crockett Canoes were good value. - It does quieten down when nighttime fireworks are on and later in the evening (after 10pm) - Food ‚Äì use the mobile order system so you can just pick up.  Ronto Roasters were great as was the noodle salad at Alien Pizza Planet.  You can also take your own snacks and fruit in which saves money and means you can guarantee some healthy food. A few other observations: - There are a large number of obese adults on motorized scooters that you have to navigate ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt what Walt imagined when he set up the disability pass system, but I understand Disney are reviewing this. - I found in the evening some teenagers would try to push in front of you in the queue on the pretense that they were looking for their friends/ parents and would therefore just walk up the queue often not even saying excuse me.  Sometimes it is obviously BS, and you can call it out ‚Äì other times I think it was genuine.  Likewise, there were always a few large groups of adults who did the same where I think 1 person queued and then the other 6-7-8 would wander up 10-15 minutes later to find their friend.  I think quite rude and annoying but hey, you don‚Äôt want to get into a fight and won‚Äôt let it ruin my vibe. - The best rides for me were Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Rise of the Resistance, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Big Thunder (noting Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain were closed when I was there).  Many other great rides and attractions as well.Still an amazing magical place but it does seem overcrowded.",Planning Tips

"Yes it is very expensive, to get it, to eat, to drink, to buy anything is crazy money but if you plan your day well it can still be magical. Look tbh we only came for Galaxys Edge but managed to get a good feel of what is still a realtively small place so easy to get around. Arrived 830 due to traffic but parked easy and on the tram in minutes. Had planned to use the monorail but messed that up but it was no issue. Through the gates and both Star Tours and HyperSpace Mountain done by 930. It was season of the force so all Star Wars themed which was great. Up to Batuu and onto the Falcon for 2 rides, and some photos infront of the fast hunk of junk.Now the queues were starting to build so out with the Genie + and a ride booked for between 12 and 1 whilst we headed to ROTR which has no lightning lane unless you pay $20 each. In good news the ride broke so we got a lighting lane for post lunch.Talking of lunch we got a package at the Plaza which gave a pass to the reserved viewing area for the parade which made Mrs D very happy. It was pricey, go back to first paragraph. But the chance to sit down for as long as we needed to eat, rest, drink and plan was well worth it. Genie + then said ROTR was back on so we headed up there and once again when we got to the front of the queue the ride broke again (it does break down a lot) so back on Genie + to get another ride in before the parade started 5.30.Parade done and whilst watching it use Genie + to book Big Thunder Mountain and that was then done before a walk back north to Toon Town where both Mickeys Runaway Railway and Roger Rabbit were both not open, these rides seem to break down alot these days.Wait for a bit, give up and back to Star Wars land for 2 rides on Rise of the Resistance. WOW WOW WOW worth the entrance fee alone. Ivy built a lightsaber for $250 and I had a Ronto Wrap and time for the fireworks above the spires which is something for Season of the Force which runs for a few months.Post fireworks the park sort of gets a bit messed up, with paths closed and people walking towards each other, with hindisght should have layed low for a bit longer. Bit of merchadise shopping and then a quick ride on Indianan Jones on a Genie + booking made whilst in Battu.Right so the positives, lovely and clean, small park but feels big so easy to get around. Never felt too busy, might have got lucky on a weekday post spring break. And Genie + does work if used rights, also remember you get free ride photos, not that many of them do that sort of thing these days which is a shame. And making a big point for time out twice helped get through a 15 hour day, remember we were only there for 1 day so had to make it count.Negatives are cost, not surpried now that the whole of the USA seems to have doubled in price for most things, but how can most people afford to come here. Also how often the rides break down especially ROTR is not on, it wasted a couple of hours of our time due to this. Battu is not that great, a big shop for Star Wars merchandise with 2 brilliant rides. Hardly see any sequel chracters and when you do they don't stop for photos, and original trilogy fans like me want to see more of our guys not just the First Order. Harry Potter at Universal edges Galaxys Edge IMO.   Also why is there not much if any GALAXY EDGE merchandise on sale here, I want to wear something in the UK that people know I went to Batuu, and not some generic star wars item. All we found was a lanyard, and some pins and magnets but I think Disney needs to stock up on specific black spire stuff. If they had I would have spent more. I even took a walk to the Star Wars shop in Downtown Disney to check I had not missed any merch but they had the usual stuff found in the park too.Would have liked to have had done the Mark twain boat, Disney Railroad and looked at a bit more on Main Street, but ran out of time that I might have had not waiting for rides that broke down too often. It is good, not magic or anything like that. The people who think that are living on past good times that might be there but not at this price with these crowds. it is well worth a visit, Genie + essential and I am glad we went just to tick off the Star Wars stuff which was an important part of our trip to the US that was delayed from 2020.",Planning Tips

"After spending the day at the California Adventure Park and enjoying the first day of the annual Food & Wine festival, quirks and all since it was day 1, the Disneyland Park is an abysmal comparison! We booked Lightening passes  at both parks and although helped us get fast passes for some rides, the hours of availability are lacking to where you can go hours without using it. The line management at the Disneyland Park was pathetic where we waited 1.5-2 hours for rides posted as 30 minutes. The attendants were useless at Space Mountain, Snow White and Spider-Man Web ride at the other park. Huge difference on how poorly these rides were managed by the knuckleheads working them‚Ä¶that‚Äôs time we were robbed from and not very magical at all. Then to top it off was the $170 dollars we wasted on the Tomorrowland Skyline Terrace dinner and seating for the evening show. What a mess to then be served a lunchable in a bento box, cold, disgusting kids sandwich and ding dongs for $170 the to have the show canceled so what did we pay for. At least have a buffet or 4 course dinner like you get in FL with any of the dinner show packages. Some champagne would be nice too, Disney to too dry compared to the other park, although we don‚Äôt hundreds on drinks, they were quite weak‚Ä¶stop selling this atrocity and revamp all your dining. Florida Disney World dining is how Disney earned its food rep, California is an insult to Disney dining. The cast members in CA are awful too. Raymond at Skyjumpers was nice, as was one black male cashier at the Tea rose and a cashier at the Space Trader store, Asia was useless. Need to bring in some Disney Florida trainers to train across all CA parks. Truly not Disney like at all. Eli at Skyline tried to make it a memorable experience but there was not enough he could to do affect the dinner or lack of show. Plus we came early to get a good table and were told no one was being seated there so we got a table we had to share with another 2 large people so we barely fit then the tables I wanted were all given to other guests!!!

Needless to say, I'm a fan.  Not a super fan, just a fan.  I'm not going to go on about ""how it used to be"" as it was never perfect.  Disneyland is just as much about who you are with as it is about the park experience.  For me, what I concern myself most with - in all of my entertainment experiences - is whether there is value for the cost.The Good:-The security check points heading into the parks is efficient and instills a sense of safety.-The cleanliness of nearly every aspect of the park-The number of available staff-The theming on all areas - pre-ride, ride, and post-ride.  The attention to details is one of the things that really adds to that Disneyland experience. -The beer and alcoholic drink choices are diverse.  I enjoyed everything I tried.  -Being able to order food and drinks from the app saved a lot of time.Just OK;-The staff are friendly, if engaged with friendliness first.  I wouldn't say staff are actively looking to have visitor interactions.-I was compelled to use the app given it is necessary for booking rides, making reservations, and ordering food/drink.  Unfortunately, this meant that I was glaring into my phone for much of the day rather than enjoying my surroundings.  -People need strollers.  It is what it is, but there are a lot and it's hard to avoid tripping on one or getting run into by one.  Not really Disneyland's fault per se.  -The food taste, presentation, and quality vary from gross to good - never great.  Pym Test Kitchen had consistently good food and we ate there 3 times for lunch.  At the Wine Country Trattoria the sauce on the Bolognese was sparse and the add on meatballs were dry.  The steak offering was an adorable 10 ounces.  The pull apart bread and calamari appetizers were the best part of the meal.  I was served a bland mass of a burger with a hockey puck for a patty at Red Rose Taverne.  All fries/tots had no salt on them, regardless of where I purchased them.  The Bad:-There are simply too many people let into the parks.  You can't walk a straight line anywhere.  You can't get anywhere efficiently.  Every aspect from the bathroom to the rides has a line.  -We had to skip Blue Bayou because we didn't have the foresight to make a reservation 60 days prior on the app and a walk-in was not available on any of our park days.-Gone is the Fastpass and now we have Genie+.  Fastpass was included with the cost of the park ticket.  Genie+ adds $30 to that.  The kicker is, that in order to take advantage of Genie+ for Rise of the Resistance or Radiator Springs Racers, I would have to pay an additional fee on top of all that, upwards of $26.   Booking with Genie+ was also much more convoluted than the Fastpass was. -The app, Genie+, and the VIP experience essentially creates a social hierarchy in the park.  I can only get the MOST Disneyland experience IF I pay literally thousands of dollars per day.  Overall, this was a great trip to be with my family and that's where the memories will live.  My boys are getting ready to move onto college, so this is our last dance at Disneyland, so to speak.  In years past, it was exciting to have a Disneyland trip coming up.

"In order to take advantage  of the ""Genie"" feature, you need to be a expert scheduler, a promising Fortune Teller, and have a crazy good luck streak. The ""tip board"" is helpful. YOU CAN ONLY BOOK ONE RIDE AT A TIME WITH THE LIGHTNING LANE.  If you back out of a booking, if you go back into it you will more than likely lose a hour or 2.  No guarantee  you will even be offered another. Two rollercoasters broke down after investing 1/2 hr wait. Stick to your plan, it's the only way. Problem being, you won't  know what step 2 of your plan is until you complete step 1, this is pertaining  to the Genie feature. The standby lane  wait times are helpful  and the only truth. I guess maybe just too many people for me. If they only let about half as many people in (reservations) the day would be worth the price.",Planning Tips
"We started the day early by parking at our favorite off site parking lot. It's called the Anaheim Hotel. It cost the same as parking on site. But because it is across the street from the entrance you don't need to wait for the Disney shuttle to take you to the park or back to your car at the end of your day. We got 3 Sip N Save passes, for 3 adults and two kids that are picky eaters. The kids did not like everything we tried. some foods were a little spicy. Not too bad for the adult taste buds but the kids thought it was too spicy. We have eaten Asian food before this trip. The food quality was about average. The portions were small for the amount of money they charge for the pass. The rides are fun for most  kids. Our 5 year old was scared on some of the rides because of the loud sound and dark entrance to some of the rides.",Parking
"We had been longtime annual passholders pre-Covid, but were unable to renew with the new Magic Key, which ended up being a blessing in disguise since I don't plan on coming back any time soon.  What set Disneyland apart from other theme parks was the magic, the attentive cast members, and that it was so remarkably CLEAN!  I heard they painted every night and I believed it, because everything always looked so FRESH, and you never saw garbage around.  Well all that has changed, Disney is so dirty now!  Overflowing trash cans, a prop drum in line for one of the rides was littered with a dozen empty cups/straws/spoons.  I can go to Six Flags and save a lot of money if I wanted to look at garbage.  There seem to be fewer cast members, and as a result there are many cranky guests.  The joyfulness that made Disney special is gone.  Now the park looks dirty and decrepit and in need of some power washing and some paint. Don't get me started on Genie + which literally requires you to spend your day staring at your phone.  It just alters the vibe and has people engaging with their devices rather than with each other.  I remember the fun of getting paper fast passes and being able to gift them to another family if we couldn't use them, it just gave us an opportunity to connect with other guests and share some pixie dust.  The bathrooms used to sparkle, but now resemble what I imagine a bus station bathroom would look like.  Overflowing garbage cans, empty soap dispensers, and the worst single ply toilet paper that breaks after every two squares.  Just very low rent and tacky, which is not what I expect from DIsney.  Oh, and one of the stalls in the women's restroom near Autopia is missing the door altogether.  This is not the Disney I know and love.  This is the first time I did not cry leaving the park because I didn't want the magic to be over.  I was happy it was our last day and don't plan on coming back within the next 5 years, at least!",Park Cleanliness
"Both parks have something to offer but be organised!The 1st day we went to disneyland and got there at 11am. Massive queue to get into carpark.  Today we arrived at 9am - much better.We got the fast passes for both worlds.  They work pretty well if you are super organised and know what you want to do. Our 1st day we were only able to use it 3 times but today we used it 5 times.Although we enjoyed both parks, you may want to consider picking one and doing Universal studios on the other day.I don't know how parents do this with young kids - looks like torture,  there are big crowds everywhere and you meed to line up for EVERYTHING! Lines for rides, lines for food, lines for backgrounds for photos and lines to get photos with your favourite characters.Food isn't cheap and not many healthy options either.The place is super clean but must generate so much rubbish with all of the packaging. With the volume of people visiting they have done a very good job of moving people around. We all had a great time, hope these tips help.",Park Cleanliness
"The Holiday season at Disneyland is always a magical time and we recently got a chance to experience the park in its entire Holiday splendor. We had not had the chance to visit the park during the holidays since before the pandemic and have recently made up for lost time with three visits this year to go along with our Halloween event covering during the D23 Expo last year.We arrived just before opening and made sure to take pictures of the tree as well as great decorations and the castle as we made our way to breakfast before heading to Star Wars Galaxy‚Äôs Edge to enjoy Rise of the Resistance and Smuggler‚Äôs Run. My wife had never experienced either on our prior visits and it was great to see her enjoying the special attractions as well as the amazing shops and scenery of the land.As always we were impressed by the amazing attention to detail from the worn look of the Resistance Gear to the sheen of the First Order technology.Our afternoon included a visit to Big Thunder Mountain, and the DVC Member Lounge but we also took in Mickey and Minnie‚Äôs Runaway Railroad with all the amazing memorabilia as well as classics like Peter Pan and Sleeping Beauty.A highlight of this visit was getting on Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye. We had not been able to experience it since the updates have been added and the enhanced optics and improvements took this classic to a new level.As evening arrived we made sure to catch the holiday parade which was a dazzling mix of color, music, and lights. We had caught some of it during the day but made sure to watch the evening show as that is where it really shined.A night voyage on the Jungle Cruise followed along with a visit to the Haunted Mansion which was sadly down when we came to visit. Thankfully we enjoyed the Pirates of the Caribbean and exited to find a very heavy downpour which soon had water pooling up and guests fleeing for the exits. We attempted to wait it out but sadly had to cut our visit shorter than we planned but still had an amazing time and were able to enjoy the spectacular lights and music as the park transformed in the evening and we made sure to visit several shops to take in the many items available.I booked a visit over my wife‚Äôs birthday in 2024 to visit the new DVC Villas at the Disneyland hotel and we look forward to more magic in the coming year and beyond especially with our next Disney Cruise scheduled for March.Reservations are required at the parks and guests will also want to make sure to visit California Adventure for more Holiday Magic as well.",Event Experiences
"We enjoyed our day at Disneyland and didn't really have issues with queues as we paid extra for the Geinie pass and planned our day.All rides were working although one did break down temporarily due to some idiot standing up and a sensor got damaged.Food is as expected overpriced, as are the souvenirs.We stayed for the fireworks, but left the park for about 90 minutes to have dinner at one of the restaurants outside the park. We paid $12 - $15 for pizzas rather than paying $5 per slice in the park.Unfortunately, we did not get a good spot for the fireworks and a tree blocked our view of all fireworks on the left side, but it was still a nice show.Parking is off site, about a 5 min shuttle bus (provided) ride away.",Event Experiences

"December 14-15, 2023zCouple broken rides. Waited in line for awhile then got the announcement that it‚Äôs having malfunction which wasted our time. We waited for the Fireworks show in Disneyland Park and they gave us the excuse of ‚Äúdue to wind, they won‚Äôt be doing the fireworks show‚Äù. But was the wind really the problem? There is a flag on top of the castle and the flag was not moving whatsoever so why would they say they can‚Äôt continue with the fireworks because of the wind? Tons of people was disappointed.

"Well a first time for all three of us. We were stoked. After all it is supposed to be to be a place for all. We were pleasantly surprised that most stores had the capability to fit wheelchairs through. Some were not as wide. We were disappointed at the lack of characters we saw. We thought they would be out and about meeting people. They also didn‚Äôt have the parades we thought they were supposed to have. I have two people on oxygen and I was told there are outlets everywhere, that is not true. The ones they have are too powerful because it‚Äôs for the food carts and cleaners. We were hoping to charge while we ate, but that was not possible. We were directed to the first aide center to charge. They were more than happy to have us charge there, but it‚Äôs time wasted for us. I noticed first aide, and the bathrooms are not clearly marked. The maps were not helpful. It seems like so much was hidden and not clearly marked. It was hard to find a cast member to help with our questions. The ones we did find were very friendly‚Ä¶ with the exception of a few. We were able to successfully ride two rides as a family. The Haunted Mansion they are able to have you ride the scooter right to the ride and pick up right after. However, the ramp in and out of the mansion is on the narrow side. So it can be difficult to fit two wheelchairs through. The cast members really go about and beyond to help you on and off. The Jungle cruise you can ride the scooter/wheelchair right on it as they have a lift. The Pirates of the Caribbean is not really made for that. As it is a good step in and out. And, when coming to the end of the ride, it‚Äôs like bumper cars. The boats aren‚Äôt controlled enough to not hit each other. At night in Adventure land and Frontierland, are super dark. I don‚Äôt have issues seeing, but I had issues seeing. There are many hills in there, so it can be a workout for those pushing wheels chairs or strollers. There are improvements that need to be made to make the experience better for more. There needs to be better maps and signage. More room for those with disabilities so they can enjoy things with their families. More visible cast members and characters. Plugs need to be made available for those who need to charge oxygen. We did have a great time, and we were happy to experience some rides together due to amazing accommodations. The staff was wonderful in not making you feel like you have a disability. We may come back again.For those going to Disney Bring back up chargersPlan ahead and try to find where you want to go to avoid wasting timeNeed a Scooter - one a across the street has after hours drop off",Accessibility Issues
We did a two day visit on a hopper ticket with genie+ to both Disneyland and California Adventure Park.

"It's very discouraging when you are handicapped and there are people with strollers taking up the space meant for handicapped people on the trams and Mickey van. It's fine if the child is handicapped or has a red tag on their wagon, but having people with REAL handicaps wait for 3 or 4 trams (like 45 min or more) just because the parents don't want to have to fold their stroller is DISGUSTING! The handicapped people should take precedence over just convenience. When will Disneyland correct this important issue??",Accessibility Issues
"Last time I came here was in 88/89, and 96 respectively. A good 27 year old break, but it still feels the same. Major changes to the parks, but the vibe remains - I felt 12 once again. Little one (daughter) enjoyed it very much. Spouse was amazed and blown away as well. The Indiana Jones ride didn‚Äôt disappoint, be it in 96 or in 2023. The extension of Disney Adventure Park is another milestone for Disney; great Pixar and Marvel extensions. The Downtown Disney District welcomes anyone before or after their adventure in either Disney parks - we were surprised at how enjoyable it was (shopping district with a little bit for everyone including kids). Holistically, it was an unforgettable experience. Please get yourself the black Sprint Jersey. It is massively comfortable.",Event Experiences
"Came her for Halloween and was amazing as it always is. In some years past the park had been lacking in maintenance but this round as great. Even during this time it was not overly busy. I did review the places we ate and they were all great. It is easy to do this on a budget if you want to. Only issue I could say is that some rides did close down due to issues but those are the more technical ones so hopefully they fine tune them to not break as easily but aside from that everything was perfect as always. Service to food, to cleanliness everything was perfect. Staying on site does help to keep you immersed and will be going back next year for Christmas",Seasonal Events

"Decided to take myself to Disneyland for my birthday as I have many wonderful memories of going there. Let me tell you times have changed or I have gotten so old, whatever. Thought I had planned it out as to where to go first etc etc.I guess we are old now as we found parking confusing. Have carrier on our Jeep so we were directed to the handicapped parking lot. OOOKKSecurity is tight, actually like that, did not like getting pushed to another exit and having to go thru it 3 times while there.Don't have an iphone so I guess I am in the minority as their Wifi sucks. kept dropping out. OK onwards and upwards. going straight to Star Wars was a mistake as so was everyone else. after finding most rides an hour wait we started to get selective and total for one day did 6 rides (so $20 a ride)will I go back, no. if I had grandkids, probably not unless I take a loan out and do lightning pass.Now, loved loved loved Star Wars, they have stuck money into this area and it shows. Rise of the Resistance was amazing, the hour and half wait not so much. Started doing the single rider pass as we did not want to stay until closing.again, we're old so maybe I had I expectations and good memories. Trying to get out after doing the Matterhorn was just nuts. there isn't enough money in the world to navigate a stroller here, give those parents credit tho.again would have loved to do Star Wars twice but that was on me not staying until 10pm.",Accessibility Issues

"We visited the Disneyland park in June for 1 day as part of our LA holiday in June from the Uk. We are a family of 4 with a disabled adult as an extra member of our party.I was very impressed with the pre application for the disability pass for our party, as we had an interview over the internet to get this approved and set up. We paid extra for fast passes, but having the disability pass for our party allowed us to juggle two bookings at the same time rather than one and enabled us to do things much faster then we thought within peak time. Initially we had only booked entry to one park, but by 3pm after the parade we felt we had done all we wanted to in the original Disney park, so paid the extra to visit the California Adventure park. Disney always delivers and we had previously been to Orlando and Paris parks. The highlights were some of the things we had never experinced before, such as Indiana Jones ride, Star Wars land, Cars ride, Spiderman and the Incredicoaster. The visit was one of the highlights of our trip. A long day with great fireworks at the end and we rounded the day of with a visit to the Disney shopping village to allow the exiting crowds to die down.",Accessibility Issues

"Eventhough the area is bit larger than USS Singapore, I feel here is smaller just because the too crowded the people, start after lunch time.Coming here at 10am and we got special lane, since we were stay in Disneyland hotel, this is important, because you can save 30 mins if regular lane.Strong advice if you are tourist, you buy VVIP ticket for special lane for 8 riding, you will save a lot of time compared to regular lane for each riding.Lunch time need to 1 hour advance, or you will be stuck in every restaurant in Disney park.Waiting for Christmas tree show was absorbing our energy since we need to waiting 45 mins before start.As well as, we were waiting for fire work show at 9.30pm.Actually, for the show, are not too interesting. Also not too many characters surrounding in the park, so we cannot the photo, just a few of characters which are not special one.If you stay in Disneyland hotel, you will feel comfortable since no need have long trip from the park to get a rest after whole day walked for 20,000 steps.Email me if there is anything you want to know.I think enough for 1 time come here, since feel boring and not too special atmosphere.",Event Experiences
"I‚Äôve been to Disney in Florida, California and Paris and Hong Kong had that same feeling the others deliver‚Ä¶ a great fun day out with all that Disney magic.They offer a few different experiences such as mystic manor, grizzly gulch ( cross between thunder mountain and Everest) , etc which adds to going to a park in a different part of the world.It‚Äôs all in a wonderful location, quite unique for a Disney Park‚Ä¶ watching the sun set on top at the main entrance railroad station was exceptional.

Plenty of souvenir shops along the main street and good choices of places for eating (although as expected a bit pricey). A lot of visitors like to dress up cosplay style and it added to the festive and pleasant atmosphere of the park. Lots of rides for all ages but one particular area that stood out for us was Frozen World with rides and the attention to details on the buildings in the village really good. Plenty of Disney characters to meet and not to be missed are the parade and of course the spectacular show against the castle background at closing time.

"Disneyland Hong Kong - Everything you would expect from Disney.  Having been to most of the Disney sites around the world, HK lives up to them all.  Great rides and classic Disney environment.   BUT on a hot day in HK, with humidity at 90% Disney let itself down.   There were very very limited places to go to shelter from the heat.  We ended up spending a lot of time in the air con gift shops.  We even asked at guest services for a restaurant with indoor seating.  There were only two on the whole site, one of which needed a second mortgage to pay for lunch.  Disney needs to think about visitor well being and add some indoor seating areas to refresh from the sun and humidity.  Other than that, a great Disney experience.",Accessibility Issues

"Ich bin hin und her gerissen.Zu Beginn Begeisterung pur , endlich an dem Ort zu sein der so gehypet wird. Erster Eindruck wow, dieses Schloss, eine mega Kulisse. Und dann wurde dieses sch√∂ne Gef√ºhl abgel√∂st von Entt√§uschung, weil man einfach mehr erwartet hat. Es ist toll keine Frage, aber wer Action sucht ist hier falsch. Und man braucht sehr viel Zeit und Geduld und einen dicken Geldbeutel. Gef√ºhlt besteht der Park nur aus Restaurants/Imbiss und Gesch√§ften. Die Attraktionen sind meiner Meinung nach zu wenig und vor allem nur 2-3 mit Nervenkitzel.  Am sp√§ten Nachmittag schwang die Stimmung dann wieder in den gelben Bereich und Abend wurde es toll. Die abschlie√üende Show war einfach nur atemberaubend. Resultat: Man muss es mal gesehen haben, aber das reicht dann auch. Ich bin froh, dass wir uns f√ºr einen Besuch im Winter (Februar) entschieden haben, denn ich mag mir gar nicht vorstellen was in den warmen Monaten dort los ist, wenn wir es schon als voll empfunden haben.

The stories, characters, and artistry is brought to life through world class Disney theatrical magic on a grand scale.The Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom, Disney Springs, and more await - allow the equivalent of a full day to discover each. Consider a multiday pass which typically includes parking, which is otherwise expensive.Be prepared for extensive walking and hot humid weather during Summer months. Much more comfortable in Winter, but be prepared for sometimes much cooler weather or rain.The Holidays are magical running from Halloween to Christmas and New Year's with extensive festive decorations, special programs and tasty treats.To really get into the spirit of Disney, dress up and be part of the show!",Seasonal Events

"I recently visited Hong Kong Disneyland, and overall, it was a magical experience! One of the highlights was the impressive Christmas tree light and drone show at 6 PM. The display was absolutely breathtaking, with the tree sparkling in all its glory and the drones creating mesmerizing formations in the night sky. It truly captured the holiday spirit and was a perfect way to end the day as we did not stay for the fireworks.However, I did find the wait times for the rides to be quite exhausting. While the attractions were certainly enjoyable, we ended up spending a significant amount of time in line, which made it challenging to experience everything we wanted. It would have been great to have shorter wait times or a more efficient system in place.Despite the long waits, the enchanting atmosphere, delightful characters, and spectacular shows made it a day to remember. I would highly recommend visiting during the festive season ‚Äî just be prepared for some waiting!",Seasonal Events
