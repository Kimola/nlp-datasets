"Spotify is very good, got many songs and suggests new ones but I've to say the app was way good before than now. Because there are lot of ads showing up. Pls don't ask us to try premium. No I don't want to. Please try to reduce the ads it would be okay if we get 2 to 3 ads in between after listening to 5 or 6 songs. It says""watch this 30 sec ad to listen to songs for 30 mins ad free"" but what we get is five 30 sec ads continuously and after listening to 2 songs we again get ads. It's irritating.",2023-01-07
"Worst update ever!!! Now, you can't even forward or backward lyrics/part in a song. WITHOUT PREMIUM. You cannot play your own playlist in order. WITHOUT PREMIUM. And what not. Now there are many things which can't be done with out premium. First users had to listen to ads in between now you can't even change to PREVIOUS SONG WITHOUT PREMIUM!! Like seriously!? Why don't the owner just make this whole app to be bought!! I'll appreciate if it's back to normal. -happy user who's now sad thank you",2023-01-07
"Intolerable it is, as they are now demanding remuneration for the recurring auditions of melodies. Presently, the facility to consecutively relish tunes from one's compilation has been withheld, and even the liberty to evade segments of a melody has been curtailed. Moreover, the sonic caliber of the melodies is dreadfully substandard, If one must expend a substantial sum for access to a scant selection of tunes, it would be prudent to consider transitioning to an alternative.",2023-01-08
"This app is totally focused on selling premium plans and not providing services , ads and ads and ads 👏🏻 , these things aside , now they are charging for bare minimum features like to play music in the playlist sequence wise or to suffle them ( although these features don't cost them nothing still to manipulate us to buy premium plans they are doing this) 🤦 heights of greed",2023-01-07
Please remove premium from Spotify it was the best music app but after a recent update its showing buy premium why we have to buy premium just for read the lyrics please remove this premium whenever i want to move back the song it's keep saying explore premium please fix this problem this app is useless I can't choose the song what I want to,2023-01-06
"The app is becoming worse and worse everyday, every basic feature is becoming premium. Even the backskip button is now a premium feature, you can't get back to a music if it gets skipped. Uninstalling Spotify. Even after so many users giving bad rating they still keep asking for money. Just money seeking creeps. Disappointed and Angry..",2023-01-06
I brought 3 month premium 1 months back but now I am Unable to log in due to some app glitch.generally such problems should be solve in 1 to 2 days but this Spotify team is not even looking in this matter. Spotify should be Thankful to Google Play store because it doesn't have negative rating otherwise Spotify could have negative rating,2023-01-07
"New update is horrible , why switch tapping back to premium , and play in order , people will be exhausted by it , they will not bry premium , instead they will delete the spotify app only and switch to other apps , bring back the old updates or it is very difficult to listen songs like this and even feels disturbing to daily listeners",2023-01-05
I really HATE the new update. Why would they remove the basic features such as shuffle and playing songs in order. They increased the amount of ads as well. Having more ads playing and removing basic features won't make people buy premium. It will only make people switch to another app. Absolutely disappointed!,2023-01-07
Used to love this app. All the features were amazing and I didn't even mind listening to the ads but the recent update has left me disappointed. Even the basic features are not available now. I hope they undo this update else I would have no other option but to look for alternatives.,2023-01-08
"this app Was perfect before and now because of this update tht removed basic features has become f#$ked up everyone hates this now remove the update, guys u can make money in a different way ,not by removing basic features! Ya'all will realise ur mistake soon",2023-01-05
"The app was really good. But recently pushing lyrics behind a wall, no shuffling etc is affecting experience. Why all this is part of Premium? Also can't decide my own song sequence ? Is it an app from George Orwell's 1984? Wish, I could give it 0 star.",2023-01-04
This WAS the best music app now even listening to a song of our time stamp requires premium so annoying 😔😔😔 didn't expected this from Spotify very disappointing I hope one day their development team watches this review and give us our Spotify back 🙂,2023-01-07
"Spotify showing their cheap tactics to get money. The recent update removes the basic functionalities like going back to previous song,skipping specific parts of the song etc. All requires premium subscription. At this point JUST DELETE THE APP!!",2023-01-06
After the new update everything is because wrost you can't even play a song specific part it's become useless if they can't fix this there is no other option then to leave this app and switch to another app if they don't fix this piece of shït,2023-01-07
"This app is turning from my fav to the worst music streaming app, it's literally forcing you to buy the premium version it's too bad, and it's not doing on all accounts at once but only some at a time, time to change my music app",2023-01-08
What are you guys trying to do? You guys removing basic features as I am writing this review they have removed the previous song button now I need to buy premium for basic things. You guys are so desperate to sell premium.,2023-01-07
Everyone's been saying the same thing. We've been using Spotify for years and suddenly we require a premium version for using all basic things. To say that I'm disappointed is an understatement.,2023-01-07
"This was a best music app but dont know why did they changed all the basic things to premium, if this was there thing then i would recomend this app is total waste of listing to songs .",2023-01-05
This was the best music app ever but now it's become worst need premium for all the features I had been using since last 4 years but now I am going to uninstall,2023-01-07
"It was one of my favourite app. But now they made changes to take premium version, and it is worst thing they did ever. I will never use this app from now on.",2023-01-07
I will suggest that don't download this trash 😤 as it many ads and for choosing a song from our own Playlist they will say you have to get the premium,2023-01-04
Spotify think he is only one music app for Indians that's why he change his T&C for free user's.......Buddy I am going to uninstall you now Bye Bye.,2023-01-07
"I love choosing my bands, learning if new music I didn't know my faves made, reading more about them, and testing Spotify's mixes for me.",2023-01-05
More focused for subscription. Too much adds And they started subscription for surfing in specific part of song Worst app for free users,2023-01-05
"Please stop giving us worst update We can't even listen our song, one by one according to playlist instead we listen other shity songs",2023-01-07
The recent update is pathetic. They are asking to upgrade to premium for even the most basic features which a music app should have.,2023-01-07
You are destroying your app with each and every change I think one day we would love to listen through YouTube more than your app,2023-01-05
Worst update ever .Better to not install for new users and good choice to delete the app for users who have already installed 👍,2023-01-05
How greedy do you have to be to turn off the song lyrics unless one pays for premium? absolutely utterly disgusting behaviour.,2023-01-05
"Wth, Spotify is no longer is useful. I just hate it at this point. Bring it back to normal. Stop being greedy for PRIMIUM",2023-01-05

"Utter BS, who'd use this app if they don't even allow to choose songs of our own. Deleting it right away.",2023-01-07
