# Kimola Cognitive NLP Datasets
These refined datasets are prepared by Kimola’s analysts to help you start and onboard to use Kimola Cognitive, a customer feedback analysis platform for dataholics, marketing and research professionals.

## Datasets (English, Multilang)
We have collected multilingual customer reviews with Kimola's [Airset Generator Browser Extension ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/airset-generator/gejjhbmdieaablhpbpmejjchiidmedmn) from various channels (Trustpilot, Tripadvisor, Google Maps, Amazon.com, Play Store and App Store) While structuring the data -as we know that there are different consumer behaviors and different feedbacks in every business - we named the conversations by the name of the product/company, business type and the channel we scraped the reviews. Each excel file has 50-250 rows of customer reviews. We have also cleaned the data considering length of the reviews to help you get a better analysis.


## Datasets By Channels
