"I got a notification from Calm at a mysteriously Perfect time. I’ve looked at the app before but wasn’t sure if I wanted to subscribe to something else that was just another app. I listen to the notification and I automatically felt some thing so I decided to try it for a little bit and see if it helps and then make my decision to go on with it or not, as a way to rewire my thinking and left more positively. I am one of those people who suffers from anxiety so much that it pretty much ruins my life. I am a very spiritual person, and all my intent and thoughts are on reaching a goal, and never giving up. So I’m deciding to try this application. With hopes that com can help me as they claim. I never set up notifications on my phone because it goes off all day and drives me crazy but I’m going to put calm on a notification so I know when it rings that it’s calm. I pray and believe that I can get help from Calm. If anyone’s really reading this, please set me up any way you can to help me out because I have a mother to take care of a family to take care of and a house to take care of along with many many other things, and I want to be able to live again and do those things better than I do already with my problem. I will put 110% into every word and every practice on this app. Please consider the people that really need this help and try to help me out as best you can. That’s all I can ask. Thank you for sending a notification. At the exact right time. I’m ready to do the work. I’ve been doing the work on my own, but I need guidance. God bless and have a wonderful day as I will also try to do. Thank you.
                                       Sincerely,
                                             Ted S.",2023-01-05
"I paid for the full membership, but it didn’t work.  I couldn’t access anything and clicking on “restore purchase,” it told me to create an account and supply them with my email address.  I hate sharing my email address.  Do you want my money or not?  

Well, I supplied them with my email address thinking I had to in order to make my PAID app work. Then the app told me to login with the Apple ID with which I bought the membership.  Umm… I only have one Apple ID.  The one I am using.  No matter what I did, I couldn’t get it to give me the access I paid for.

Aaaannnnd they immediately started spamming me.  I clicked on unsubscribe immediately without reading their idiotic sales pitch that I never wanted in the first place. I hate that crap.  

But they kept spamming me anyway. Clicked on unsubscribe again.  And I still couldn’t make my paid account work. For two days and some more unwanted spam later, I finally went to Apple and asked for a refund.  I got it. Thank goodness. 

The spam was immediate and really off-putting.  I am not putting up with that.  Put them on my junk sender list and deleted the app entirely.  I hate that they have my email address now, though. Super sketchy.",2023-01-02
"First off, I would like to say everyone is different and how this app effects them may vary. In my experience though it has helped me so much with my anxiety. It’s helped me sleep better and just feel much better about myself. I was struggling the last couple months with anxiety and it was causing me panic attacks and I started to get full blown insomnia. For two weeks I had totaled at 8 and a half hours of sleep the whole week (not one night). My cousin gifted me a yearly subscription for this app and genuinely have never been more grateful. If you have the resources to spend on this app and you really need it, I would definitely recommend giving it a chance. If you don’t have the money I’m not sure what the free version is like but it may be good. And a word of advice, also use resources outside the app for help as well! You got this and stay strong!",2023-01-07
"I was able to get a one year Premium subscription for super cheap with a special deal. After using it for a few days, the meditations are fine. What I find super frustrating is there is NO way to easily filter and search for meditations. For example, in another FREE app, I can filter by time, male vs female voice, key word (e.g. binaural), with or without music, even preview the voice. With Calm, there is no way to do that. You can only pick a category, like sleep or mediation. I prefer sleep meditations with music, but I have to literally play at least 30 seconds of each and every one or ff to see if it has it. I’ve already canceled my subscription to ensure it won’t renew next year because not at all worth full price at $70 when other apps for way less or free have better navigation and functionality.",2023-01-03
I started using the calm app when I was struggling and things were falling apart. Now I start my day off by meditating with the calm app. I listen to Tamar’s daily calm and it helps me to focus on what I want to concentrate for self improvement. Calm has helped me to make self care a priority which has improved my relationships with my family and friend. I live more in the moment that helps me to respond with kindness and compassion instead of react with anger and hurt. I now enjoy my own company and am learning to treat myself like I would treat my friends. Calm app has gently encouraged me to reflect on myself and the positive changes just followed. I look forward each morning to start my day listening to Tamara and then now also squeeze in Daily Jay and session with Jeff.,2023-01-07
"The sleep stories, meditations, etc with great narrators are just that - great! They’re really effective and I love the variety of offerings within each category. How. Ev. Er. I don’t know if she created the app and therefore voices many of the pieces, but Tamara Levitt’s voice makes my skin crawl. (I really mean no offense if you’re reading this Tamara! I’m sure you’re a wonderful kind human and I appreciate you!) It feels sickly sweet and overly gentle, the vocal fry and flirty lilt make it impossible for me to focus on the meditation. Like at all. It feels very self-conscious and fake. Like a Dove chocolate commercial. That’s obviously not the intention, it’s just way too much of a performance of a meditation guide for me. Other than that-love the app!",2023-01-05
"I’ve tried to incorporate meditation into my life so many times over the years, yet only since starting with the Calm app have I succeeded. The app has so much variety — from 1-minute to much longer guided meditations, varying approaches and diverse teachers or meditation leaders. There’s always something helpful there. I’ve gone from just the Daily Jay (Jay Shetty) mindfulness lessons to now turning to the Calm app 3 times most days - a mindful start with the Daily Jay, a midday break with one of the work-related meditations or one of the nap programs, and an evening mindfulness check-in. Everyone around me sees the difference. Most importantly, I see the difference. I’m coming up on 365 consecutive days of this, and I’m not going to stop.",2023-01-07
"The app is an excellent tool to add to your toolkit or coping skills so to speak. Incorporated into my daily routine it is a very effective quick way to check in to manage my stress and any other emotion I experience. As a licensed clinician working in the mental health field I have a duty to take care of myself above all things. Calm helps me relieve the stress of the work day and reminds me that I can only help others if I am at my best. Being centered and ready to take on the day with happiness, enthusiasm, and passion is the foundation of my existence. Adding Calm to my tool box, bag of tricks, or coping skills no matter what language you use this is a valuable addition to your self-care routine.

Hi I’m Ellie and I have a very hard time getting a good amount of sleep that’s why I use kids stories on calm. Every time I can’t go to sleep I listen to a story and fall asleep almost immediately. I also sometimes use the breath or the daily move. I use the breath because it helps me relax and calm down. I use that daily move cus it helps my move stretch and it makes me feel tired. My favorite part about calm is the kids stories. My favorite story is raggedy an stories. I like that story because it reminds me of just being calm you know. Anyway this is why I use calm and I think if you have any trouble with breathing falling to sleep exercise and much more. Calm has it. 😊,2023-01-02
"I once thought this app was a good way to actually help stay calm. Unfortunately this is no longer the case. I was paying $69.99 a year for features that are actually free. I decided to cancel. It’s been a few months since I’ve had the service. 

On October 8th I get a message saying “here’s a 7 day trial to come back to Calm on Us” after the 7 day trial I would be charged $69.99 for the year premium account. Low and behold I was charged immediately. I notified apple as well as calm and both sides are putting up their hands like they can’t do anything. 

Do yourself a favor DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP OR TAKE ANY SPECIAL PROMOTIONS FROM THEM. THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY.",2023-01-04
"I downloaded this to try to find a free meditation app. There are so many subscriptions that I was hoping this free version would be decent. It’s not. In the middle of meditating, and finally getting my body to relax, ADS start playing. Do you know how jarring that is to a nervous system? Listening to calm music and all of sudden loud ads playing! I understand that these apps if free sometimes will have ads.. but geeeeez let people finish listening to a 15 -30 min meditation that you advertise as FREE before playing ads. 
Sad that even something that is supposed to help the mental health of people is trying to first find a way to make money off of you",2023-01-03
"I find trying to maintain streaks in apps stressful and anxiety producing. I meditate to when I can and to help myself, and not meditating one day is not a failure, it’s just a day I didn’t meditate.

I was so happy to find Calm had a setting to turn off streaks. I turned it off immediately and enjoyed not being guilt tripped by a relaxation app.

Welp, the latest update launched and immediately prompted me to add a “goal” of three Calm meditations per week, and added a seven day checklist at the top of the home tab. :( now I can’t even open the app without it guilting me towards obsess e behavior :(",2023-01-03
"Has some nice spoken relaxation segments, that are quite well done.  Also a lot of natural sound segments, rain, distant thunder.  My main complaints are:  Not enough spoken content, and of those they are very brief - less than 10 minutes.  Calm is a captive app, you can't download useful content to any other app like iTunes.  So if you find a spoken exercise that really helps you, you have to maintain the Calm app account to listen to it.  There is a lot of sound files that seem to be there as 'filler' as opposed to useful spoken content.  Finally, the price is ridiculously high for what you get.",2023-01-04
"Calm App is pretty great. My only issue is after a few days of use, the playlists quit working. You start a playlist, it plays the first song, and goes back to the home screen. The only fix I found is to delete the app, and redownload. That gets old quick. 5/2/23, Im back redownloading the app because the playlists stopped working. 5/20/23, back yet again to redownload because the playlists stopped working. 8/28/23, here we are again. Playlists stop working again after one song. 10/8/23, playlists quit working again. Time to delete the app and reinstall. Will this ever get fixed?",2023-01-05
"I absolutely love the CALM app! It has truly transformed my daily life for the better. The soothing meditations and sleep stories help me unwind after a long day, and the mindfulness exercises keep me grounded and focused. The app's user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate, and the variety of content ensures there's always something to suit my mood. CALM has become an essential part of my self-care routine, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone seeking peace and relaxation in their hectic lives. Thank you, CALM, for making mindfulness and tranquility so accessible!",2023-01-07
"I really like this app. It allows you to be able to meditate, practice mindfulness, listen to sounds when trying to fall asleep, and practice techniques to work on anxiety and stress. Not only that, it is very aesthectically pleaasing to the eye. This app is easy to navigate through. I also like that this app is availavle for people of all ages to use. The app is a bit pricey, but the free portion of the app is enough to use if you do not want to pay for it. I suggest using the 7-day free trial to see if you want to pay for it, or if you just want to stick with the free app.",2023-01-07
"Tried this app for one reason only: walking meditations on my Apple Watch. Ready for my walk, I started up the app, selected my walk duration, and hit play. Nothing ever started playing. Tried multiple times for over 5 minutes and the content just never loaded. I thought maybe the cellular connection on my watch was poor, but when I opened Apple’s Fitness app, I was able to start playing a Time to Walk episode right away that I hadn’t previously downloaded or anything. Tried Calm again when I got home. Still wouldn’t load. Canceled my free trial and uninstalled the app.",2023-01-07
"After hearing recommendations for this app I redownloaded it and signed in with my apple account. I even selected to subscribe for a year with a 40% off discount only to be charged the regular price of 69.99 instead of 41.99!!! THEN in the app it says all Premium content is still locked! I turned off the phone, logged out, logged in and NOTHING! Still all content locked out! I'm out 69.99$ and already requested a refund to Apple which I'm praying they accept because this is beyond stressful and unnaceptable. FIX YOUR APP THAT IS SUPPOSED TO CALM PEOPLE NOT STRESS THEM!",2023-01-08
"I started using Calm 3 years ago during one of the lowest points in my life. What a difference it has made for me!
The sleep stories are amazingly beautiful and effective, the guided meditations perfect for beginners or seasoned meditators and the inspirational bits just what I need when I’m feeling down. 
My favorite is the Daily Trip with Jeff. Love all his series, especially the beginner ones. He literally teaches the fundamentals of meditation in such an easy and unpretentious way. 
I am very grateful to all the creators and contributors behind this app.",2023-01-05
"I have long been told that mindfulness would help my anxiety and ADHD (51 year old adult here), but every time I tried over the years it was so boring and simply maddening to just sit and try not to be distracted. Calm isn’t like that at all! I do the walking meditations and the moving meditations, I listen as I lay in bed at night and I’m doing it often enough I can listen to the meditations while I do other activities such as drive and just focus on listening and breathing. It’s a game changer and I’m learning to let go of my anxiety and panic. Thank you!",2023-01-05
"WARNING — if you are thinking of signing up for the free 7 day trial, you will be charged for a year’s subscription and you will not be able to cancel and be refunded.  Be certain you want this app for a year because by signing up for the free trial you will pay $69.99 and it won’t be refunded if you try to cancel.

I tried the app, didn’t care for it and tried to cancel the next day.  There is no way to cancel this ‘free 7 day trial.’   Support is of no help.  The only thing I was able to cancel was the annual renewal for next year.  

Very unhappy.",2023-01-07
"The Calm app has truly transformed my daily routine. It’s my go-to for finding peace and relaxation amidst life’s chaos. The guided meditations and sleep stories are a game-changer for my sleep quality. The soothing sounds and beautiful visuals transport me to a serene place whenever I need it. I appreciate the variety of content, from mindfulness exercises to stress relief techniques. Calm has become an essential part of my self-care journey, and I couldn’t recommend it more highly. Thank you for creating this oasis of tranquility in my busy life!",2023-01-07
"I’ve been using this app for 4+ years now and it has become an integral part of my life. My mental health has improved since and meditating routinely became possible because of this app. I love the way it is setup for all background levels and has many other useful lifestyle improvement based aspects like better sleep, focus and movement. I would recommend this app to anyone who is looking to work on those things or even just trying to explore the fields of mindfulness and positive psychology and/or appreciate a well made app.",2023-01-01
I think you should have more options for people who can afford your app. Anxiety and mental health is a real thing! I would love using the app if there more options then me having to pay for. Most people who having mental health don’t have the option or the means to pay for little things like this that could help more than you could image. Start sponsoring ads and have us watch some ads to unlock some features (like most apps do) stop trying to earn money off of people’s mental health problems!,2023-01-06
"I tried this app out for awhile with a free trial. I canceled my subscription before it was supposed to charge me and it still tried to charge me days after I canceled. It's been well over a month since I canceled my subscription and it's still attempting to charge me for another month of the premium. This is a known issue according to the BBB. Many people are being charged after they cancel their subscriptions. 

Do NOT download this app if you value your hard earned money.",2023-01-05
"I’ve loved Calm for years, but the latest update broke the app on my iPad. Now when I go to play a sleep story and close the lid on my iPad, within 10 seconds the story stops playing. If I leave the cover open, when the screen timeout goes to sleep, the story stops playing. I can tell you this frustration is the opposite of Calmness. Please fix it soon and I’ll change my rating to 5 stars.

Update: They fixed the bug I reported to their support team.",2023-01-05
"I love the premium version of this app. It is absolutely worth it. The design is gorgeous and comforting, I truly feel at ease after listening to the water background style that I chose.

My only critique is that Mel's Movement Moments need to be longer. 4-7 minutes is not enough time to connect deeply with your body if you are seeking guided movement. I use movement for meditation primarily and would love to see longer options, even 1 or 2 sessions!",2023-01-06
"As a cancer patient, a friend recommended Calm. It wasn’t a good fit for me, but at the end of week’s trial, an annual subscription fee was automatically charged. Attempts to switch to monthly were futile. I could cancel, but told I would continue to access the program for the remainder of the year, in essence non-cancellable with no refund. Trial subscriptions can be ideal to test, but this App not having customer support has proved disappointing.",2023-01-05
"There are some really good speakers and stories uncommon but there are also some juvenile horrible speakers on Calm  and we should be able give them a thumbs up or thumbs down, The Daily, Jay for instance, just sounds contrived and fake a lot of these people seem like they’re just reading a simple script. Their voices are a fake and soothing as chalk on a board. And get more adult stories some of these sound like I’m on the Disney Channel.",2023-01-07
"I love to meditate with Jeff Warren every morning.  His voice and words help me start my day.  

I finish my day with harry styles, because of his lovely soothing voice and story

I also love to take the mindful breaks during the day, any time .  There’s always something on calm to help me live my life better and more meaningful 

Thank you for being here.  I will stay as long as my favorites are here .  Also Tamara Levit she very god also",2023-01-07
"So, i have been listening and enjoying sleep stories for years but there is one that is completely and totally possesses me for a long time.. It’s not just the voice of narrator and it he certainly not his looks lol.. but the story itself. Today, i am in Paris and it’s raining.. and i never thought i would enjoy as much as i do today, the day as it goes now.. Thank you for emotions it evoke and for the memories associated with your story.",2023-01-07
So far I had access to renew my membership thru my employer for &amp;14.99. Could never got it activated so I paid 49.99 to get access but it is still not working like it did before and talks about premium membership. I’ve paid plenty. I made calls and e-mails to try and get it fixed. I want the number to calm so I can talk to someone I’m person.  I have been very sick and really need this app to calm me down. Please someone help me?,2023-01-07
"GREAT!

They’ve been releasing a lot of new sleep stories lately, with celebrities like Harry Styles and P!NK. The stories and sounds are so relaxing and put me right to sleep. I use it almost every night it is an addiction. It fills my sleepy mind with magical stories as I drift off to sleep. It’d be so cool of you had someone like Taylor Swift on there though. I’m listening to a sleep story right now while writing this review!",2023-01-05
"Filed a report with Apple and Bank. 
Says in App Store, and on iPhone subscriptions as valid for one year but when trying to open premium or restore purchase options it just says to sign in with the Apple ID used to purchase… 
This is my one iPhone with one 20 year+ Apple ID. As someone who has purchased hundreds of apps, this is the first time none of the normal recovery steps work (as an IT Professional). 
Very disappointed.",2023-01-07
I just started using this app consistently &amp; I’m really liking it to help deal w/ life stressors at the moment.  The only thing I struggle with is I don’t find most of the narrators voices calming or relaxing (but great content!).  It would be really nice if there were different options &amp; customers could change to whatever voice they respond to better.  Other then that fantastic &amp; worth the subscription price.,2023-01-07
"I’ve been using this since elementary, and I cannot sleep with out it tbh! And I’m just gonna say what everyone is thinking… ADD MORE BOB ROSS ASMR EPISODES PLS MY GUYS 😂😊 i fr luv the Bob Ross ones!!

"I love Calm! It is one of my must-have apps, my favorites are the Sleep Stories and I always look forward to the frequent additions to the collection! 

I do wish I am able to access Sleep Stories through my Watch app and/or download certain sleep stories in advance! This is nice for when I don’t want to wake up from my phone screen or risk getting distracted again. 

Thank you Calm Team!!! Keep up the great work!!!",2023-01-04
"I was introduced to Calm in 2015 to help me sleep. Since that time I have found it as a resourceful tool to lull me to sleep, relieve pain through guided breathing, meditate more often, and usher peace with a vast array of soundscapes. It did not take me long to upgrade. Though I have a couple of other similar wellness apps, I have never been compelled to get rid of Calm. It is a great wellness enabler.",2023-01-05
I am a health care worker that lives on a pager. My sleep is disturbed regularly by getting woken up in the middle of the night. I used to lye in bed unable to fall back to sleep. Knowing I would be exhausted when I had to go to work the next day. Calm changed that! Listening to a sleep story helps me to fall back to sleep quickly. It’s comforting to know I have this app to help me on those nights.,2023-01-06
"Since the moment I began meditating and listening to calm music,soundscapes, and sleep stories (Ya! It’s not just meditating lol) I’ve felt a peace settle over me! I’ve endured a lot of pain and suffering in my life and I recommend this to anyone even if you haven’t suffered severe trauma. I think young kids would benefit the most. Thank you everyone from calm I hope you feel my gratitude 💜",2023-01-05
"I’m not sure what happens in these stories because I typically fall to sleep before they end. I wake hours later with my Bluetooth face mask half off my face feeling very rested .All of the story tellers voices are so calm and just relaxing it really works . Since I’ve gotten older I find it harder and harder to shut my mind off , listening to this at night is making my sleep more restful .",2023-01-03
"My life has been a real struggle for me for the past 2 years. The past 8 months have been horrible. Had it not been for this site I’m not sure I would be here. Thank you for all the wonderful work that you do.

I was offered $10 a year through Tmobile. I paid for it and logged in though my Apple ID like it requested. In doesn’t recognize my purchase and keeps asking me to sign up for $70 a month. I then started getting spam emails telling me I can sign up for $40. The irony is that the app is called “Calm” which caused me hours of frustration and troubleshooting is almost funny. Almost……,2023-01-03
"But I’ve only started using it regularly in the last few weeks. It’s exceptional &amp; I’m enjoying splitting my meditations between Calm and Breethe. 
Calm’s customer service is terrific as well and that is huge in my book. We needed a refund on the yearly for my mother who didn’t really need it &amp; they kindly refunded the accidental purchase. Top notch app! Worth every penny.",2023-01-08
"This app has helped me to create so much space and awareness, mentally and physically! I love how they add new sessions with new mindful curators to keep things new and interesting. I love the daily move… I’ve been a subscriber for years now and I can hardly imagine life without it! I love the daily streaks counter, and the automatic mindful minutes calculator. Thank you calm.",2023-01-08
"I've used this app for some time and have enjoyed every moment of it. The options to suit your needs (anxiety, focus, sleep, etc.) provide something for everyone. I highly recommend this app to always have calm moments available to you when you need it! I also recommend this app to my clients as something to try and potentially integrate into their daily routine.",2023-01-05
"I have been utilizing the Calm app for the last four days. My wife had suggested I tried using this, but my manly persona kept me from trying to take this seriously. At this point, I have no other options other than to seek out meditation to clear my head each day. So far this has been so helpful thank you to the creators that assembled this app.",2023-01-05
"Have been using the app for over a year. It has made a major difference to my stress levels. Now, you have to put in effort and try to really at least try to believe that it will help, but build the mindful tools and daily calm habit and you won’t be dissipointed! It is very inspired by real Psychology as well, so these are proven effective tools",2023-01-06
"If you can afford Lebron James you should be able to afford to hire experienced Black American, Latinx, Asian, Indigenous, &amp; Pacific Islander people and voices.

"I’ve had this app, free to my fingertips (with my work affiliation), for the last couple years. Never used it..until 2 weeks ago. It’s helped with my sleep sooo much! Especially when I wake up at 2-3am, when my mind is spinning, I play one of the “fall back asleep”

When I heard the brown noise it makes me not breath, and it stressed me out even more.
It’s a problem for me, but I understand if it helps others.
Just not me.

If someone has the same anxiety problems as me, it might be dangerous.",2023-01-04
I have used Calm since 2019 and I have loved it. My running streak is over 600 days. But for them to increase the price when the majority of Americans are literally living paycheck to paycheck is something I will not stand for. F your corporate greed. There’s plenty of free meditations and sleep stories on YouTube. I’m out.,2023-01-05
The app was okay. Paid the $1 trial and didn’t really like it then cancelled my subscription via the App Store cause that’s an option a few days ago. Got charged $70 today. Can I get a refund cause the iPhone App Store told me I canceled it and removed it from my subscription and my subscription was supposed to be canceled.,2023-01-05
Just subscribe and spend the money! Falling asleep to these stories or nature sounds is wonderful! I love being lulled to sleep by these story tellers and their wonderful voices. I never get to the end of the story … because I’M ASLEEP!  Best app ever invented! Slept like a baby minus the thumb sucking and bed wetting.,2023-01-04
"I am enjoying this specifically during my morning excercise routine. It helps me to start my day with a calm and relaxed mood.

"Have a few meditation apps, but I keep coming back to this one!

"I’ve used Calm for years now and LOVE it!

One critic:  I used to be able to hit play on a play list and listen to the whole thing.  Now, it stops after only one track and I have to continually go back and select the next song.  Is there a fix for this?  Am I missing a setting somewhere?  Please fix!!!",2023-01-07
"Calm is the most helpful app I’ve had in a long time! It helps me get rid of any stress in general. I love yoga and meditating, so this app seemed perfect for me.

"I’d like to see the ability to make a playlist. I wake up a lot and it’s too quiet. I like the stories. I’d like to make a playlist of stories that would play all night. Most existing playlists only last about 6 hours. I need something that lasts longer than that, preferably stories that I can choose.",2023-01-07
"You can find variants of all of this on YouTube and your preferred streaming service. It’s fine and does the trick, but this isn’t “all that”. Yeah, your favorite actor talks calmly to you, but it’s not going to fix what your music app can’t already do itself. Peek around, it’s not worth the money.",2023-01-07
"…specifically I am thinking about wishing I could block a certain speaker’s meditations etc from showing up in my feed. I found her voice to be very grating, and it is not conducive to relaxation to have to keep scrolling bc I can’t quickly find an appropriate meditation without her leading it.",2023-01-07
"This app is not for Deaf or hard of hearing people.  Everything is auditory based, which limits who can use the app and how people approach or engage with meditation.  Diversify the methods you are using if you want to reach a wider audience.  Present visual and text based options please.",2023-01-02
Only three days into using this Calm app and I am very pleased with it. I suffer from insomnia and tinnitus. The tools on here for relief are abundant. I especially like all the various options. And there is lots of positivity type messages and stories. Thank you for creating this app.,2023-01-07
"I love the variety of options, and that you can mark those you particularly enjoy! My complaint, however, is you can't mark something that you didn't like it. It's nice that you can see your favorites all together but it would be nice to see which ones you do not want to try again",2023-01-07
This app is great for what I need. But I didn’t like how the option of giving a review kept showing up when I opened the app. Almost felt like I was forced to give a review. (I need some time to decide how good the app may be - that way I’m able to give a more concise review.),2023-01-06
"I have been using the Calm app for several years now. Calm provides so many wonderful options for slowing down and great bedtime stories that never fail to put me to sleep. I really appreciate Calm and all of the exceptionally talented people
who participate in our well-being.",2023-01-07
"I love this app,me my sister and my mom use it and it gives of great device and motivational things this app changed the way I think I hope more people use this app because it is life changing and it helps me fall asleep get motivated and meditat on what I  am  thankful for.",2023-01-05
"I absolutely love sleep stories but was wondering why on earth you would distort Michael Griffith’s incredibly perfect voice on the latest Humphrey story. His voice on earlier recordings was just right. Oh Calm, you do so disappoint sometimes….but you still get 5 stars.",2023-01-07
The free version of this app is an utter joke. You get access to literally nothing. I saw an ad for this app showing “brown noise” to help fall asleep quicker and the only way to actually access anything is to pay. Garbage app and not worth the time wasted downloading.,2023-01-05
"When I open calm it makes me feel welcome and safe. And every one 
Everywhere should be able to feel that so get calm it helps in so many ways for people like sleeping and calming also it help people who are alone and have know one to listen to so just thank you.",2023-01-04
"Calm is always there, this subtle CALMing presence lurking quietly in the background, or gently reminding me that there is a teeny space right before me where I can write large words, think quietly about important matters, and just reflect and breathe. . .",2023-01-06
"Loved this app loved the high quality sleep stories, except now their is a lag in new content! Rarely a new one that’s good. I’ve honestly started using “Get Sleepy” app bc they have a great new story once or twice a week, takes Calm a month or 2 for one….",2023-01-07
"Calm allows you to fav good tracks, but doesn’t allow you to down vote bad ones. As good tracks allow you to let go and not focus on them I don’t tend to fav them but would appreciate being able to mark or delete bad tracks that pull you out of meditation",2023-01-05
In my opinion clam has saved my life. It gives me something to be accountable to everyday. I set a goal to do it everyday for a year. I missed one day on a misunderstanding. I’m very thankful for this app. It has made a difference in my life. Thank you,2023-01-06
Purchased premium and says to log in under email used to purchase. That’s the email I used still it doesn’t work. Attempted to contact customer support and it wouldn’t let me email them or start a chat.  Never again. Beware if your considering it.,2023-01-04
"So……
I love this app but, there is so much that requires premium and I hate to complain but what if you can’t afford/don't want to pay so much i would like it if you could take offers and have a little less premium stuff 
     Thank you 🙏",2023-01-05
"I got the app in hopes of sleep as I’ve suffering with anxiety and awful reoccurring memories, I not to find every single thing I click requires me to sign up for the premium free trial…idek what is free! Ridiculous, a horrible experience.",2023-01-08
I’ve been in here for a week. So far I feel like the have good content. The app is nice and easy to use. It asks you how you’re feeling and it guides you towards a section that hopefully can help you or get to the bottom of your emotions.,2023-01-03
This app is amazing! I come home after a long day a busy work and go on calm and listen to my favorite videos. I live this app because it makes me feel calm and relaxed while only taking a few minutes! This app is a 10/10 would recommend!,2023-01-05
"My work has offered calm as a benefit and I am so glad I took the time to look into it a bit more seriously. 
It is now a part of my daily routine, waking up in the morning stretching meditating and before bed to unwind and go to sleep.",2023-01-03
"I use the app only for sleep. For sleep the selection of music / sound is small and the main long play track  432 for sleep has bells and chimes. Dear Calm, bells and chimes are used as ALARMS not sleep aids. Not worth the $70 for me.",2023-01-06
"As the name suggests, this app helped me feel calmer than I was before using it, but its real gift to me was helping me realize that there’s more space between me and this chaotic world than I thought. What a powerful realization!",2023-01-07
"I have used this app over the years to increase my meditation skills.  Learning about mindfulness practices.  Many other skills in being in the world in a positive way are discussed and actual practices can be experienced.

"I really like Calm &amp; especially its soundscapes. But I miss the ‘how are you feeling’ screen that left with the latest update. It allowed me to do a quick self-check as I opened the app. Consider bringing it back, please.",2023-01-06
I don’t associate calm with crickets. This is especially true for the meditation recordings. I have Calm set to Spanish so perhaps it’s not on the English recording. It really ruins the experience of an otherwise great app.,2023-01-05
I love this app! Not only do I use it for myself to unwind or relax but sometimes my class of 25- 5 years olds can get a little overwhelming so we take a meditation break. The kids wind down and it really helps. ❤️❤️❤️❤️,2023-01-07

I have been using the free version of Calm for the last four years and just signed up for the premium subscription. My daughter likes having lots of different options for stories and music to listen to in the night.,2023-01-03
"I love going to sleep to a bedtime story!  I can’t afford to get the premium stories. But when I had just signed up, I was able to listen to some wonderful stories told by some well known people. It was so good!",2023-01-07
I rely on my Calm app every single night to help me fall asleep. I have not even begun to use this wonderful offering to its fullest! Looking forward to discovering the gems to be discovered…Love the Calm app!!!,2023-01-08
"Between the noise of daily life and the struggle and stress that life brings, this app is my oasis. I begin each day and, sometimes throughout the day by stopping to let go of everything. It keeps me grounded.",2023-01-04
"When you decide you will not renew… the only choice the App gives you, is to renew… all my  other subscriptions allow a choice (thus I’m at the right place for the transaction) … to me that is a major scam…",2023-01-05
"You are helping me to align my internal purpose with my outside purpose every day. Besides to that, Im able to share what consider the most valuable exercises with my community.

"I use this app for my daily morning meditation, the “Open-ended” meditation; and it no longer syncs with them Apple Health app. I retried resetting, uninstalling and nothing works. The app is now subpar.",2023-01-07
The number of times this app peer pressures you to share stresses me out. I cant indulge in a single mindful moment or in a deep thought without getting right hooked in the face with a request to share.,2023-01-07
