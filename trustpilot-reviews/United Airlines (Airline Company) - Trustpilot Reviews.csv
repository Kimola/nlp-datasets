Terrible airline.  Used to fly them a lot. Thought I would try them again due to a lot less $$$ in Polaris from Newark to Amsterdam than Delta/KLM. Everything about United is second rate. Worst airline flown in many years.,2023-01-07

spent 24 hrs trying to book online called them got transferred from one department to another and no one to talk too to sort things out. THIS IS THE WORST ONLINE AND GOING PERSUADE EVERONE AGAINST BOOKING THROUGH YOU. THIS AIRLINE IS WORTH ZERO STARS,2023-01-01

I booked a flight and paid to upgrade to economy plus for $194. My ticket said “basic economy” so I complained at the gate and showed them the receipt. The United agent refused to help me and told me we would be served like a basic economy passenger.,2023-01-07

UA960 flight got delayed more than 4.5 hours at Newark on 17December 22 Making my freshman kid loose connecting flight in Frankfurt. Poor communication and facilities provided in case of delays. Never to fly United or American or Delta for international routes.,2023-01-07
do you like music blasted in the plane for a 10 pm flight? do you like your flight to be delayed because the catering company was late getting first class their food? fly with united for a headache before you leave the ground and an extra hour sitting in the plane.,2023-01-07
I flew first class and was so thankful. 3 flights in a day snd 3 flights home. The service was exceptional and my flights were on time and drama free. Just the way I like it. United did an awesome job and that’s the reason I try to fly with them as much as possible.,2023-01-08
What to write about this airline I feel bad to write a review when everyone has told the real story about this organisation. They should be banned and boycotted. Horrible airline to fly please ignore them if you can as they we have faced ignorant and racist behaviour,2023-01-02
"Me perdieron la maleta en un vuelo Zurich-Chicago y la atención fie excelente por parte de todo el personal. Estuvw un par de días sin maleta por lo que me dijeronnque comprara lo que necesitara y que guardase lo tiquets, así lo hice y me pagaron lo que tuve que comprar.",2023-01-03

"My experience was much better than I tought. Paris to New Orleans and return - no missed connecting flights, no late flight. I really thought they would give me a hard time (carry-on, seats all over the plane for my family ) because I flew basic economy but it didnt happen",2023-01-06
"At the very last minute, United changed our flight times I'm the evening from 9:40 pm to 11:40 pm and said it is for maintenance. We also had to change gates and take a shuttle to the gate they set up from the delay. We paid for these tickets well over 6 months ago. It's ridiculous.",2023-01-05
Had a round trip flight from Spokane to Nashville.Both ways we had delays the first made me miss my connecting  flight. Then they have no contact payment for inflight drinks/snacks but you need wifi to use the app. Soo if you want to get drinks or snacks you have to buy wifi access.,2023-01-07
"Flight from Edinburgh to Chicago cancelled on July 1st, flew out 28 hours later.  Numerous messages on the app, DMs on twitter, emails trying to get compensation.  The story from United changed constantly.  The latest is that I’ll get ‘resolution’ on approx December 14th.Disgraceful.",2023-01-03
"Har nu to gange betalt for flyrejse, hvor betaling er godkendt via NemID, men når jeg vender tilbage til deres hjemmeside får jeg meddelelse om at transaktion er mislykkedes, prøv igen senere. Betalinger er ikke trukket fra min konto, men fremstår som “venter” på min Masterkort konto",2023-01-07
"Hi, I booked an isle seat via Lufthansa and the flight was carried out by United. But when I checked in, it was not possible to get it. The quality of food and beverage in Premium Economy is not worth to spend extra money compared to economy. Not comparable to Lufthansa Premium Economy.",2023-01-06
Unbelievably poor. From paying for seat selection that I was then denied for half the flights to rude staff who were completely indifferent to our situation when there were delays in passport control and we missed our connecting flights. Would never recommend nor use again if at all possible.,2023-01-06
Bin mehrfach in meinem Leben in die USA geflogen und oft mit United. 2022 bin ich 2 x mal mit United Airlines geflogen und war jedes mal sehr sehr zufrieden. Lufthansa im Vergleich ist viel viel schlechter von der Qualität der Flugzeuge und dem Service onboard. Werde immer wieder United buchen.,2023-01-07
Will never book United again. You're being punished for booking Economy. My flight is at 6.15 AM in the morning and this company won't let me check in online because I'm not checking a bag. You know how that looks United. It looks like you don't trust your customers. I WILL NEVER BOOK UNITED AGAIN!,2023-01-05
"Ich hatte economy plus,wurde einfach invdie Eco Notausstiegvumgebucht. Durchgesessenen Sitz für Langstrecke Newark/Berlin. Danke United für die Unzuverlässigkeit. Bei einer Europäischen Airline hätten sie Ärger. Das ist nicht das was vereinbart und teuer gekauft  wurde.  Das war der letzte United Flug..",2023-01-05
"Although I'm fully aware that I purchased economy tickets, United airlines whated me to pay €600 to cancel my flights in order to request a refund on a €980 ticket..

"Der Hinflug am 16.05. von MUC nach EWR hatte 5 Stunden Verspätung. Ich habe direkt eine Entschädigung eingefordert, trotzdem hat es bis heute (09.06.2023!!) gedauert, bis das Geld auf meinem Konto war. In der Zwischenzeit musste ich ständig per Mail nachfragen und irgendwelche unsinnigen Formulare ausfüllen.",2023-01-04
"Des voleurs!! Ne prenez jamais des billets avec cette compagnie. Ils ont annulé mon billet avion retour sans nous prevenir. Quand je les ai appelé, ils ont juste dit que je devais prendre un autre billet à mes frais. Voleurs! Service client incompétent et inutile. Ne faites pas affaire avec cette compagnie!!",2023-01-04
"UA Brussels to Newark Here we are all , waiting at the gate on time departure ready to go.Only for it to be announced the entire crew is late !!! And we will be 20 to 30 mins late departure, because the crew could not wake up an get the airport l.Its beyond my understanding to comprehend how this could happen.",2023-01-07
"I had the worst experience flying through United. I had traveled all day; and upon getting my bag from baggage claims, my bag was damaged. I reported this to customer services through United they gave me this bs that I should have reported within 24 hours for them to cover the cost. I will never fly United again!",2023-01-06
"This airline should be downgraded to a “budget airline.”  Its policy of not allowing you to check in online on a basic economy ticket is the dumbest thing an airline has thought of.  I’ve had so many bad experiences with United over the years, but this last trip was so bad I had to give it the rating it deserves.",2023-01-07
"Habe noch nie im Leben so einen schlechten Kundenservice erleben dürfen, das die sich überhaupt Service nennen dürfen! Wer wartet freiwillig 8 Wochen auf eine Antwort? Erst über 3 Stunden an meinem Endziel angekommen und nun bekomme ich keine Infos wie es weiter geht, bereits mehrere Mail geschrieben ohne Antwort.",2023-01-03
"The absolute worst!!! The price of my ticket kept going down and every time they charge $50 to get the price adjustment!!!! Right after 30 days, the flight went down $200 and they would not allow me to pay the $50 again to get the tickets for $200 less! Rude customer service! Chose another airline! United is awful!!",2023-01-06
"Might as well not have a chatbot. Doesn't work half the time, and when you can get connected with someone, expect to wait several minutes between responses. Calling the 800 number was even less helpful in my case. Was trying to ask a simple question which should've taken 5 minutes. Took 3 hours and still not resolved.",2023-01-03
"First and last time with united.  how come.  Flight to Detroit stayed 8 hours in chicago, canceled 4 flights.  Return flight again from Detroit to Chicago canceled, both times fewer passengers.  in the end I have to fly to Washington and then not with the same class that I reserved.  Nightmare, never again, this society",2023-01-08
Every single United flight I’ve ever taken has been delayed. Every time that has resulted in missed connections. This airline may as well be a scam with their lack of being able to provide the service that United travelers pay for and not providing refunds for missed legs caused by their inability to operate efficiently.,2023-01-05
Our trip from San Francisco to Vancouver was delayed because of a computer problem with he airplane. This delay mushroomed as we missed connecting flights and an important meeting. My heart is not healthy and the stress this caused was very uncomfortable.  I sent a complaint to United and didn't even hear back from them.,2023-01-05
"United has improved significantly over the past couple of years. I am a very frequent traveler and note that there are fewer delays , improvements to United Clubs and improvements to benefits. During my recent trip the crew was outstanding. This is becoming more of a norm and that is not true of some of thier competitors.",2023-01-06
Failed to have gluten-free meal available after requesting it in the app. Carzy fees for oversized bags. On the return flight the stewardesses kept bumping my shoulder in the isle seat. I was seated next to a larger person and only had the isle arm rest. I couldn't understand why after the 2nd time they couldn't maneuver better.,2023-01-07
"Essen von zu Hause mitbringen bitteNovember 202211 Stunde Flug, 1 Mahlzeit direkt nach dem Abflug, dann 1 kleine Packung Snack und das was.man konnte sogar nichts bestellen und selber zahlen da die Hostess sagte als ich eine bowl bestellen wollte ""i m sorry we don't have something like that "" bringt ihr essen von zu Hause bitte.",2023-01-08
Never experienced anything like the disgraceful “customer service” at united airlines. I am literally told on my face “sorry not my issue” when I’m asking someone to assist me with self service check in by a representative who’s only job is to assist people with check in. No words.. hopefully don’t have to ever use this airline again,2023-01-03
"Wir sind mit der United Airlines zum ersten Mal am 10.12.22 von Frankfurt nach Chicago geflogen. American Airlines, Lufthansa, Avianca, Eurowings, Ryanair, TUI etc. kennen wir bereits. Allerdings waren wir vom Service der United sehr positiv überrascht. Besonders das Essen hat extrem gut geschmeckt. Der Kaffee der Marke Illy genauso.",2023-01-07
Wat een schijt bedrijf!! Kom je te laat voor mijn afspraak! de vrouw achter de balie geeft er geen f*ck om en wil me niet eens te woord staan. Ze neemt de telefoon tussen door op of ga andere mensen helpen. Heb een normaal gesprek proberen te voeren maar dit gaat gewoon niet Mijn vlucht was van newark Amerika naar Amsterdam Nederland.,2023-01-05
"The company canceled the first leg of our flight, and rebooked all the connecting flughta to another day without our confirmation. We could have driven instead of the first canceled flight, and reached out to them immediately. But they have already given our seats away and were forced to waste a day without any compensation. Very bad rebooking experience",2023-01-04
"The staff is incredibly untrained. They lack the basic skills of a skilled labor. I asked them if i missed boarding, the staff told me i still have time. We figured out that the staff randomly gives answers to people. Some of the answers are not only untrue, but also misleading. My flight of 15 hours became a flight of 30 hours. Stay away at all costs!!!",2023-01-07
Delayed for two days now and still waiting. The worst flight experience I’ve ever had in my life and they refuse to compensate me back for the ticket. Terrible customer service. Worst customer service I’ve EVER had. It wins a lot of #1 worst awards for me. All around the most terrible company I’ve ever dealt with. Garbage airline and needs to be shut down,2023-01-05
"“Fully refundable tickets” are not fully refundable. A 100 USD refund fee is charged. Before buying the ticket, I even called to ensure that there would be no fee. Now they didn’t even apologise for having given what they call “inaccurate” information. Also, it is incredibly difficult to find anything about this fee on their website or during purchase flow.",2023-01-04
"Pris pour 2 vols intérieurs aux US. Le personnel au sol désagréable au possible, n’est d’aucune aide et pas aimable. L’avion est vieux, pas forcément d’écran ou alors fonctionnant mal, les prises USB ne fonctionnent pas et mon accoudoir côté couloir était sur le point de se décrocher et les dossiers de certains sièges tombaient en lambeaux. Franchement à fuir.",2023-01-03
Extremely rude and unprofessional! I bought seat 9A on flight 2239 (IAH to SFO) on Nov 14th! And when I was on board they changed my seat to a middle seat! And when I asked for refund they said if you want refund I have to go to the back and put me between two very large people even tho they had free seats somewhere else! They behavior was so disgusting and rude!,2023-01-08
Delayed luggage on the 8th May 2022 - claim for expenses agreed on 14th December!! Still waiting for my money 31st Jan 2023. Was told it could be up to 45 days and when chased today was told due to the number of claims being handled - ie all the screw ups they continue to make - it could be 60 days. I live in hope. Shocking service and will never fly with UA again.,2023-01-07
"Ich habe schon oft United Airlines für Überseeflüge benutzt und kann nur bestätigen, dass immer alles bestens und tadellos funktioniert hat. Auch musste ich schon öfter den Kundenservice für Umbuchungen kontaktieren, was jedesmal unkompliziert und sehr freundlich abgelaufen ist. Ich kann diese Fluglinie aufgrund meiner Erfahrungen mit gutem Gewissen weiterempfehlen.",2023-01-07
"Ich habe mein Gepäck 5 Tage nach Ankunft erhalten und wir mussten den Urlaub komplett umplanen da wir eigentlich ein Road Trip geplant hatten, ich mein Gepäck dann aber nie erhalten hätte. Zusätzlich zu den Umbuchungsgebühren und den versauten Urkaub musste ich 400$ investieren für Kleidung, Hygieneartikel und co und habe keinen Cent von der Fluggesellschaft erhalten.",2023-01-03
Was für ein Witz! Wegen einer verspätung sollte meine Mutter eine Nacht in Chicago bleiben aber auf EIGENE Kosten. weder eine entschädigung oder gutmachung bekommen selbst auf nachfrage. Gab natürlich auch keine Infos vorher sondern erst am flughafen. Mitarbeiter waren auch unfreundlich. Will jetzt nicht unbedingt die rassisten karte ziehen aber hat sich so angefühlt.,2023-01-07
"Had a call with customer service today and I inquired about traveling with wedding attire. I spoke with the kindest representative, Jamie. He was knowledgeable and patient with my questions. After making sure I felt comfortable with travel arrangements, he offered upgraded seats as a ""wedding gift"" to us. We truly appreciate the gesture and awesome service. Thank you!",2023-01-07
"$375 to upgrade to what I thought was premium economy, but was just some bs seat with 4” more leg room. No tv’s on the seat for a 6 1/2 hour flight from LAX to Honolulu and told to pay for WI-FI, but it didn’t work over the Pacific. Great.  No movies, no entertainment. No food except for the 1” square fruit “bar” or a handful of trail mix. MOST GHETTO AIRLINE IN THE SKIES",2023-01-01
"Solved our nightmare problems within 5 minutes of speaking to them, when the 3rd party booking provider couldn't solve them for over a month and with 10+ calls.I was just so impressed with how efficient the service was, and my wife and I now have a HUGE weight lifted off our shoulders for our flight back home to Australia from the UK. I'm now a lifetime fan of United Airlines",2023-01-08
"I cannot be constructive about United Airlines, they are an absolute and utter debacle, a disgrace to the Airline Industry, How on earth they can justify promoting their service as quality is beyond me. Completely dismissed my genuine and evidential complaint.I would rather row a boat over the Atlantic then use this Airline again. A very poor excuse for a transportation provider.",2023-01-02
This airline company it’s a joke their customer service is so poor they give wrong information  they absolutely have no customers service whatsoever very very disappointing it’s been 2 weeks since I contacted United Airlines customer care and no one even bothered to respond I will never use them again if anyone is booking flights with them please don’t you will be so disappointed,2023-01-08
"I bought a united airline ticket (basic economy) and they canceled my flight.  This is Dec 25 Christmas. After hours on the phone, I found a flight that night but they would NOT book it for me as it was economy, not the basic economy. The same seat as you know but they will not secure it so I have to wait till the 27th to fly out! Thanks, United for ruining my family's Christmas!!",2023-01-07
"This airline is literally the worst. They canceled our flight to Seattle. Because the flight was domestic they will not give people their bags. I watched honeymoons get ruined. Cruses get ruined, and my bag with a firearm is going to take a ride to Seattle for nothing. And then need to be flown home. The staff is unsympathetic. They are all fat. Nasty attitudes. Fly any other airline.",2023-01-03
"We were at the airport @ 2:30 for a 3:30 flight. We were issued $20 dinner coupons that didn’t work. They ran us up & down B concourse giving us 6 different gates.  Now it’s 11:03PM , 7 1/2  hours late and finally boarding.   For a 3 1/2 hour flight.  Not acceptable performance. You would expect this from a startup airline. It’s a good thing next time I will remember that we have choices.",2023-01-06
"Ein Stern ist noch zu viel! Aus 3 Reisetagen wurden 5, völlig inkompetentes Personal, man bekommt keinerlei Informationen. Flug wurde 5h lang verschoben, da die Airline Essen im Flieger vergammeln ließ und mitten in der Nacht dann doch noch gecancelt. Wir sind das erste und letzte Mal mit United Airlines geflogen! Hinflug war bereits eine Katastrophe, doch der Rückflug toppt noch mal alles.",2023-01-05
"Terrible airline - poor time planning for connecting flights (you have to check out, go through security and check in again + security) they expect you to do that in 1hr 30mins 😂 when I asked to skip a flight (I wanted to drive to Houston instead of risking the connection) they tried to change me an extra £128 for the pleasure!Really poor airline - just pay the extra for someone a bit better",2023-01-07
"They refused to give us our money back when US Covid entry requirement charged. Our £500 flight credit is worth £300 due to ‘exchange rate’ when we tried to use the credit.Their target market is business travellers, so they aren’t interested in customer service for holiday makers.

Flights were late into Newark with United (their fault) do we missed connecting flight to London. No one from United around to help so had to go to baggage services ? Queued for 2 Hrs only got help after complaining it’s now 1am with 2 kids. Couldn’t provide hotel at airport so agreed we’d be compensated it we booked and paid ourselves. Now won’t pay compensation for the hotel. Awful customer service,2023-01-03
"Uitstekende service, vriendelijk personeel en met een overstap die maar 45 minuten duurde na delay bij de continentale vlucht deed United er alles aan.om de intercontinentale te halen en dat lukte prima. Eten en drinken was goede kwaliteit en ruimschoots. Hier kan KLM nog veel van leren. En het personeel was betrokken, persoonlijk en zeer beleefd. Echt gewoon een goede ervaring op heen- en terugreis.",2023-01-05
"My Wife and I just had the wonderful service experience from United Airlines Staff and all concerned on our recent trip from Sydney, Australia to San Francisco. We were travelling home to Canada and I must your friendly cabin employees made this long flight a pleasure in every way!  I thank you for the pleasure we received from your very comfortable Airline.

"United airlines hat meinen Flug storniert während der Pandemie. Die Fluglinie hat nicht das Geld zurückgegeben, sondern eine Gutschrift. Andere Fluglinien haben mir das Geld zurückgegeben: British Airways und KLM. Ich wollte die Gutschrift einlösen und die gleiche Strecke fliegen nur in die Umgekehrte Richtung. Das war nicht möglich. Ich habe meine Gutschrift verloren. Sie sind überhaupt nicht Engegenkommend.",2023-01-05
"Luggage was delayed for 5 nights 31/07/22. I have emailed, called, filled in customer care forms but still no outcome or compensation. They told me so many lies, it took hours online and in calls just to locate it and now they aren’t paying for what we needed. It’s impossible to speak to someone in person too. Aware lost baggage isn’t entirely their fault but the service and help since has been horrendous. ☹️",2023-01-08
"My recent flight with United Airlines was impressive from start to finish. Their user-friendly website and app streamlined check-in and provided real-time updates. Boarding was efficient, and the attentive cabin crew made the journey comfortable. The diverse inflight entertainment and cleanliness measures added to the positive experience. I'd highly recommend United Airlines for a hassle-free and enjoyable trip.",2023-01-03
Surprisingly I’d say United flight attendants are the nicest in the ski now.  They used to be pretty nasty.  It is surprising the number of errors that I get when trying to buy tickets.  Recently I used the fare lock a few times.  In each instance my card was charged but the fare lock didn’t get added to my account and I lost the tickets.  Super annoying that a company of UALs size has check out issues like this.,2023-01-07
Worst airline I've been on.Delayed 3 and a half hours so missed my connection and had to pay for a new ticket to get back home.Food was disgusting and the girl next to me took one bite and left it alone.One of the window shades wouldn't go down so a flight attendant out a piece of cardboard over it.Charming.Lots of other little issues too but I'll never use them again when there's no recompense for missed flights.,2023-01-05
"Une honte! Sur 3 vols vous nous avez séparés 3 fois ma famille et moi. Je n’ai pas pu m’asseoir à côté de mon bébé car aucun passager n’a souhaité changer de place et ce, pendant 9h. Par ailleurs, quand on explique la situation à vos hôtesses elle nous explique que nous sommes en classe économique. And so what? Nous ne sommes pas du bétail. Quand on exprime notre mécontentent on menace de nous débarquer. Shame on you!",2023-01-07

Flight attendant Asian male with gray hair came to collect the trash and all he wanted was to pick up few trashes and move on. He refused to accept more trashes, he walked away very rudely. When he came to collect again, he walked so fast that no one  can give him the trash. I even noticed when he did other duties, he looked lazy and grouchy.",2023-01-07

"Openly racist. Refusing to speak to a logical question(s)…without provocation. Referring to passengers as “white boy”Refusing to do basics requests such as rebooking a flight. Intentionally refusing to print boarding passes, knowing the time was short to make the still boarding flight-causing passengers to miss flights. I called the 1800 number as well and they refused this as even a possibility. I  have a video of this on YouTube.",2023-01-04
"Als ich Wasser bestellen wollte verstand mich die Stwardess nicht. Sie bot mir Vodka an, ich sagte sofort nein und nannte das Wort ""Wasser"" auf verschiedenen Sprachen (Water, Aqua etc.).

Some behind me and some in front of me. for no reason I was told they gave my seat away. As I watched economy folks board the plane. Then the gate agent lied to me in my face and said the door was closed when I arrived.However, I videoed other boarding. Then she said she could rebook my flight and she left.",2023-01-07
"Service im Vergleich zu anderen Airlines gut zu erreichen, die E-Mails jedoch teils etwas missverständlich formuliert.Meine Reservierung ist leider wegen doppelter Reservierung gecancelt worden, und musste daher umgebucht werden.

But the last trip I made  I flew out of New Orleans an the worker at the ticket counter was very nice. She took my phone an used the Kiosk an checked me in, an was very helpful. Her name was Andree Roberts An I want to shout  out what a very good employee United has . Wish everyone was this nice !!!",2023-01-08
1.Frankfurt Flughafen Check In unorganisiert jeder Flug wird zur selben Zeit eingecheckt.2.Durch das Chaos wurde mein Koffer bestimmt falsch eingecheckt unter anderem Namen deshalb kam es in Waschington nicht an. 3.Kein Sitzplatz vergeben weshalb sich vor dem Boarding wieder wieder anstellen um ein Sitzplatznr. zu bekommen. Wirkte auf mich sehr chaotisch.Ich bin mal gespannt ob ich mein Koffer bekomme. Ansonsten werden die Kosten bei United eingereicht.,2023-01-07
Es war das schlimmste Erlebnis was ich mit einer Airline je hatte. Während ich das hier schreibe warte ich schon eine Stunde am baggage claim und habe deshalb meinen zweiten Zug verpasst. Den ersten habe ich bereits verpasst da der erste Flug um saubere sechs Stunden verschoben wurde. Zwar gab es dann einen Ersatzflug bei dem ich mehrmals nachgefragt habe ob mein Koffer ankommt. Sieht man ja dass das nicht so wirklich funktioniert hat. Einfach nur Sauer!,2023-01-04
"Received an offer for a card card for United Airlines.  One of the perks was that you get to have a free bag as well as your companion when you fly.  They also gave 50,000 points.  Well if you use the points to book your flight then you pay for the bags.  I am sure there is some small print somewhere but stared our trip off with $140 of unexpected fees.   $35 per bag each way!!  Very disappointed.I will cancel my credit card and go back to flying southwest.",2023-01-08

Sollten um 17:45 in der Luft sein- es ist gerade 20:10 und wir sitzen im Flieger ohne Vorankommen. Angeblich geht es in 30 Minuten los. Ich fliege das erste Mal mit dieser Gesellschaft und auch das letzte Mal.",2023-01-05
Absolutely horrible airline. They don't enforce the rule to put personal bags under the seat and carryons on the oberhead compartiment wich results in not having enough space for the people who were charged extra to keep their carry-on. Entitled moronpassengers don't give a crap and shove their small bags in the overhead and need to be educated by the staff. I suggested it to a stewardess and she had the rudest reaction. Terrible airline. Even low cost ryanair is better,2023-01-03
Absolute worst airlines and customer support. My bag came out of the carousel completely ruined and destroyed. They offered me a $150 credit or a replacement bag that they provide. Seriously? My brand new away luggage looks like it went through a garbage disposal and all they can offer is $150 credit or some crappy luggage. Customer service is rude and I can’t believe they treat and speak to customers this way. Not to mention my suitcase was opened and things were missing,2023-01-08
"On friday march 31 I called for help with my  changes made to my schedule flight , I was very lucky when a lady (I think her name is Lynell) answered , she went above and beyond to assist me at one point we got disconnected and to my surprise she called me back ( it has never happened to me before) Kudos to her .  She should be recognized for the outstanding service.  My confirmation number is LLN9N9 , please make sure to recognize the lady that provided that excellent service.",2023-01-07
"My customer service experience was horrible. I asked a simple question about baggage allowance. After 45 minutes chatting with the first agent, I asked to be escalated because they had no idea what the policy of their own company was. After another 20 minutes and and a so-called ‘supervisor’, I still did not receive an answer and was told I would get an email with the answer. Still no email and no answer to my question. Very disappointed and wish I would have booked with another airline.",2023-01-06
"Rude, passive aggressive attitudes from the flight attendants. Infantilized by male flight attendant. No adult traveling with children cares to be spoken to as if they are ignorant, incompetent especially not by persons who are supposed to be providing a service.

Your airline and poorly rated and there are no shortage of reasons why.",2023-01-06
6 derniers vols sur United depuis avril 2022: entre 1h30 et 4h de retard. Excuses très douteuses. Service à bord très moyen. Cerise sur le gâteau : arrivé à NYC Newark en transit avec boarding pass sur iPhone et sur papier… mais refusé. J’ai dû télécharger leur application sans wifi dispo donc à des tarifs de data stratosphériques. Malheureusement pas toujours évident de trouver une autre compagnie en fonction des horaires souhaités mais di j’avais le choix: j’éviterais absolument United !Mauvais !!,2023-01-05
"Worst customer service I have ever encountered! First plane, pilot didn’t show up, so I had to take a detour. Second plane had no AC and had to be jump started! Emergency landing in Dallas, where the guy that met us at the gate was extremely rude, even the flight attendant said she never met anyone so rude at the gate before. Got a hotel at 3:30am. Flight was supposed to leave at 1pm, (same rude person at the counter 😩) delayed till1:30, delayed again at 6pm! I got a flight with a different airline.",2023-01-05
"Terrible. Don't bet your vacation on United. the planes break constantly, the staff 'times out"" meaning they stop plane and tell everyone to get off because they can't work anymore, bags lost, and first class food is terrible and poor quality.  Literally nothing is good about this airline. We lost 2 days of vacation, due to flight issues, bags lost, and over night stays due to United Airlines. Never again will fly with them. Staff even told us this is typical and it seems they are dealing with issues constantly.",2023-01-07

"The United gate agent at the Washington Dulles Airport was arrested and fired for stealing my jewelry that was turned into her by a fellow passenger. United did not respond to my calls or emails for over a year. This is how they treat their million mile fliers. They burry the issue and hope it would go away. They ignore loyal customers. To make matters worse I was pregnant at the time. There's so much wrong here. It's a shame it was an airlines I once loved and supported. There are so many other airlines, choose another one.",2023-01-06

I ask If I can get a refund or credit and the agent stated its against our policy. Alaska airlines always refunds you if the fair drops in price.

"I have learned two good lessons. Never fly United/Swiss internationally and never connect through Zürich Switzerland. First of all, they put my wife and I in two complete different areas on a 12 hour fight, then when you try to get it changed they keep saying they can’t let you upgrade grade or change your seats so you have to call Swiss. Then Swiss says they can’t do it to call United. Finally they say we have to change it at the airport. We get to the airport then there are no other seats available! Get your act together United!!! Never Again!!!",2023-01-02

And not even with other peoples carry ons, literally with safety equipment. Why would you seat me where there is no room for my bags when I am paying for carry-on service as part of my ticket?Awfully disappointing and our flight has been delayed because of mechanical issues as well. Not exactly reassuring. Very disappointed.",2023-01-07
"United Airlines canceled my flight because a first-class passenger insulted a stewardess. The 80+ year old woman used a profanity, and the flight attendant then asked her to de-board. She refused and United instead took everyone off the plane instead. They eventually canceled the flight 5 hours later. In the meantime, they only provided drinks and sandwiches to around half the people because they apparently could not drum up enough water, drinks, and food for everyone in one of the world's largest airports. Shame on you United. You honestly need a new leadership team.",2023-01-07
"United lures in clients with attractive ticket prices which turn out not to be available once you want to pay. This however isn't shown on their webpage. the webpage asks you to call United. When you do this they tell you the flights are no longer available or at a much higher price. In my judgement this is misleading. United seems to be cheaper than other airlines but turns out to be more expensive. As said this is misleading and I even wonder if United isn't obliged to respect the pricing as the comment of ""system failure"" is only made after paying has been declined.",2023-01-05
Normally I don't write reviews but with United airlines I make an exception.-The stuff at the airport is kind and helpfulSo is not their faultThe airplaneThe seatsThe space between your seat and the one if front of you is as narrow as low cost company as Ryanair but is not acceptable for long intercontinental flightsFoodI took more then 1000 flights in my life but a terrible food as in my new york Milan I really never had such service with any company before this experience. Breakfast was only a package super terrible plastic sandwichThis service is absolutely disgraceful,2023-01-03

Die Nacht im Hotel in F wurde uns bezahlt. Der Flug fand mit 28 stündiger Verspätung statt. Mein Mietauto und das gebuchte Hotel in SF musste ich zahlen, toll. Eine Entschädigung hat United abgelehnt, Gründe wurden nicht genannt. Ich habe die Sache inzwischen an meinem RA übergeben. Schade, die Jahre davor war ich mit United eigentlich zufrieden. Nun fliege ich mit anderen Gesellschaften",2023-01-02
So tired of travel. The cost and service are both so over rated. Packed carry on so we can avoid waiting for luggage. Of course there isn’t enough room for ours on the plane and the force all 4 to gate check them. As we board there is definitely space for a few more suit cases. Flight attendants also could ask all people with back packs and jackets to stop being selfish jerks and put it under the seat in-front of them.The human race is in a whole new way. I will update when we get our luggage as it is full of gifts. If any are broken I will be contacting for reimbursement!,2023-01-07
"Flug von Washington DC nach Frankfurt. Der Flug war leider eine Katastrophe. Service unhöflich, knallt Essen einfach hin, rennt durch die Gänge beim Getränke verteilen. Essen ein echter Witz, Sitze wirklich absolute Frechheit. Klar ist es in der Economy eng, aber den Nachbarn 8h auf seiner Seite zu haben weil ein normal großer man nichtmehr in die Sitze passt ist echt der Oberhammer. Auch insgesamt irre Lautstärke an Bord - ist entweder die Austattung oder auch die Service-Kräfte die permanent Radau machen. Bitte werft UA aus der Star Alliance raus. Es ist eine Katastrophe.",2023-01-07
"They canceled my flight on June 18, 2023, due to their mechanical problem, and they asked us to pay for the hotel and meals ourselves first without any arrangements for that night. They said passengers can submit it to their website and be reimbursed later. They are a liar and never respond to your request. When you contact them, they will ask you to submit to many different departments and say your money cannot be refunded.

And, we had  to check the bags too!!  We were literally 5 min late to the desk to check in our carryons and we were not allowed on our flight.  There were others in the same predicament.  We were bumped to a much later flight which resulted in losing our car rental (still having to pay for it) and we missed all the things we had planned to do that day.

Wir erhielten sogar trotz Basic Economy auf 3 Flügen Sitzplätze nebeneinander.Die Gepäckrichtlinien in der Basic Economy für Transatlantikflüge mit Zwischenstopp sind leider nicht ganz klar - auf verschiedenen Seiten von United finden sich unterschiedliche Angaben.

Der Reisezeitraum sollte angeblich auch nach dem 5.3. liegen können. Diese Aussage des Mitarbeiters war falsch. Ich habe mich schriftlich beschwert.

"Booked 2 x tickets from EDI to EWR, turns out this was not enough for United Airlines so they decided to take an additional payment of £505.31 without consent.This resulted in other payments bouncing as a direct result of their error. This is not my first issue with United Airlines, however back in September of last year I decided not to complain.Upon contacting them to discuss the matter, I was basically called a LIAR although I can evidence the payment taken in error and the impact this has had.I would recommend paying a little extra to fly with another airline, this will be the last time I travel with them period.",2023-01-04

We hadden een vlucht van Amsterdam naar Houston (10 uur) en een vlucht van Houston naar Sydney (17 uur). De vluchten waren optijd, vriendelijk personeel, lekker en veel eten in het vliegtuig en goed entertainment aan boord (veel films, HBO Max, etc.). Kortom, heel tevreden over deze airline! Ik laat normaal nooit reviews achter, maar doordat deze slechte reviews ons aan het twijfelen hadden gebracht, wilde ik toch even een tegengeluid geven.

"United's dysfunctional partnership with Vistara Airlines.We had booked Business Class Award Travel for flights SEA-SFO-DEL-BOM using 93,500 miles.United failed to transfer our bags to the Air India flight in SFO even though there was 2 hour connecting time. To make matters worse, they did not send our bags to DEL on the next day's flight. Instead they sent the bags 2 days later via Chicago to Delhi, resulting in a 4 day delay of some bags and 6 days on another.We have received sincere apologies from UA, but such mistakes should not happen.

Ich dachte nicht, dass die Airline ernsthaft meine Covid-Impfung von vor 1,5 bzw 2 Jahren sehen möchte, was LH letztes Jahr im Sommer nicht wollte. Dass das UA Personal in FFM das Thema kommentiert mit ""Tja, sie müssen halt auch die Emails lesen"", fand ich sehr unangebracht. Damit erschöpfte sich dann auch die Problemlösungskompetenz der nachlässig gekleideten Angestellten, die ohnehin schon keinen einladenden Eindruck gemacht haben.

"My wife and I flew to Cody Wyoming from jacksonville Florida in October 2022 to hunt wild game. All bags showed up except firearms. They didn’t deliver until the next day at noon. 20 days later we returned to jacksonville our home.  Same thing happened, all bags showed up except firearms for hunting. United was helpless trying to track our firearms, same thing happened to others on both flights. There is no excuse for this, I’ve flown Delta for 20 years on this same trip, no problems on delta’s flights. I never plan to fly United airlines again!!I should be reimbursed completely for our troubles no doubt. Do not fly United!!!!!!!!!!!!",2023-01-08
After My flight got delay I had to spend a night in Chicago and fly the following day. United offered no hotel or food though the delay was almost a full day (to the following day). My flight which I then was booked to didn’t have the same class available so they also downgraded my ticket. Later when I contacted them to get some of my money for food hotel and a premium economy ticket which I never got back they offered my a lousy 150$ voucher. My own expenses was beyond 400$ and they deny paying me back the premium economy ticket which they were unable to deliver. Worst airline ever - they are always delayed and really don’t care about their costumers..,2023-01-07
"They ""stole"" my hard earned miles. I made a reservation for my wife and son to join me on my trip to orlando. To buy 27000 miles they were asking $945! So I figure let me use my miles that I have which were 27111. The 2 tickets were $878.40 including taxes. So I figure these 2 tickets will be for free...Wrong! They only gave me $277.40 for my 27074 miles from my account. So you see the miles and the BS they sell you to use their credit card and get miles does not worth the same. Is just a scam as all of the mile programs from all airlines. Is better to get a credit card that gives you cash back instead of using this scams from the airlines. You have been warned!",2023-01-07
"Worse than spirit and frontier. They have a new and very sneaky policy which charges for normal carryons. Ended up running us $110 to check 1 bag and 2 regular carryons. Their employees were nice, but United-Corporate hung them out to dry. They were clearly burnt out and getting shredded by customers relentlessly over the companies nickel and diming behavior. The flight itself was also garbage. We will never be flying united again, and if you are reading this, we highly recommend you don’t either. I would rate it 0/5 if I could.

Paid for family of 4 sitting together, last minute aircraft change pushed us to individual seats. Had to pay £600 online to take (last) new seats of 2 and 2. We are not being refunded apparently as we should have waited to do this at airport. The aircraft makes Ryan air look like business class. Old, dirty and extremely crammed. Including economy plus. Cannot believe we paid so much for crummy expensive flights and experince. 5 star prices for 1 star offering. Never again even if flights were free. On the plus side the cabin crew seem lovely.",2023-01-05
On April 22 after checking in for my flight I was trying to go through tsa and was told my id and name on boarding pass don't match. I was told to go back to united counter and have my pass changed. The manager told me I needed to call American express because I book through them. I was on the phone in the airport for two hours with American express who was on the phone the whole time with United. Neither could change my ticket. At this point I was frantic and went back to the counter and said I have to get home what can I do. The manager said I had to buy a whole new ticket by that time I had to purchase a later flight. Nothing worse then feeling like you are going to be stranded somewhere,2023-01-05
"If I could give zero stars, I would. This company has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I payed for a flight, changed it, got a 'flight credit' for 2,500 USD. I needed to change a different flight du to an emergency and the fare difference was pretty much the same and some change (plus 90 USD). WELL, APPARENTLY TO USE THE CREDIT, THE FLIGHT DIFFERENCE NEEDS TO BE EXACT OR GREATER. They wouldn't make an exception for 90 USD  for me to use my credit. I spoke to a supervisor. No possibility, no nothing. SO I ate it and payed the additional fee. Absolute robbery. Companies like United deserve to lose all of their customer loyalty, we need better options that cater to customers.",2023-01-07
"After an 7+ hour layover all we've been offered is a $15 food voucher. I spent well over $100 on airport food and water while waiting. I kinda ask the addendant if they could comp water or Powerade and she told me to call customer service she was ""too busy"". I was in shock. Instead of giving realistic delay times so we could leave the airport, or book other flights... United slowly increased the delay hour by hour due to maintenance. I finally get on the plane to Maui for our 7+ hour flight and there are no screens nor free wifi. I paid extra for economy plus seating. Which has proven to be absolutely pointless unless you enjoy paying $$$ just to get off the plane faster.  Has United turned into frontier?",2023-01-04

"UnprofessionalThey caused 13h+!!!! hours delay to my parent's arrival (who are in their 60s, travelled for the 1st time and donn't speak english). It was very stressfull and frustrating. I did not sleep that night trying to help them through out allthese issues, talking to agents and translating.  I talked to the agent on the phone and he kept blaming the previous airline my parent used for the trip from Europe. He refused to give me his badge number so I can't put any complaint against him. So disapponinted with them. I don't wantanyboday to experience this, so If you 're flying your parents with united I recommend NOT to do that.

"I cant complain enough about my experience with United, it has been an on going nightmare with this company. I have had to navigate (unfortunately) 3 separate flights with them. No matter who I talk to, manager or not, they do not follow through on their jobs. They have repeatedly messed up my flights/ credits/ cant take my forms of payment- and I have LITERALLY spent 7 hours on the phone with them the past 2 weeks. THATS ALOT OF TIME!!! I am appalled and will avoid them at all costs in the future. I have currently been on hold (for the uncountable time) for over an hour waiting for them to figure out how to accept ANY of my credit or debit cards that will not go through.

Con'sThe whole plane looked like it was going to fall apart. Loose exit signs.Loose panels on seats. Broken food tray and TV screen arms. The seats and compartments were dirty.There were empty packaging and tissues in compartments. The food tray was the dirty. The toilets were dirty too. The food options on the phone app are impossible to access and impossible to change. The planes need a good deep clean or need a full refurbishment.The meals were tasteless and the tea was bitter.

"I have been a Premier 1K member on United Airlines for many years (saying this because it shows that I have been a long-standing, loyal customer) and am ready to throw in the towel and move on. Of my last 4 flights, all 4 have been delayed getting me to my destination more than 12 hours after the scheduled arrival or canceled outright. It is impossible to contact customer service - a hold time in excess of an hour is not customer service - or to get accurate information at the euphemistically named ""help desks"" at the airport. Fundamentally, United is not a functioning airline and I do need a functioning airline. Oh, and the ""compensation"" for these disrupted travel plans has been beyond a joke - definitely not conforming to United's ""policies"".",2023-01-05
"If I could drop zero stars, I would. Customer service people have zero customer service skills, they are rude, the management is even more rude than the CS, they will change flight times on you with no notification and then blame you for not knowing. They will admittedly send flights out early without all passengers to make everyone else happy because they would prefer to deal with a single unhappy customer if it makes everyone else happy on the flight. I' supposed to be in California right now holding my son and instead I will be sitting in this dump all night long until he's in bed. Why? So united Airlines can make a plane full of people happy at my expense.Do not fly with this airline, do not fly with this airline, DO NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE!",2023-01-03
"Absolutely terrible customer service. Trying to get compensation for a 5 hour flight delay, 4th time trying to contact. Each time told something different. Doesn't look like they will be offering any compensation for the delay.What is most concerning is the breaches of data protection as my past trip details have been taken off my account (after my trip) and added onto someone else's account to which I do now know the person ans cannot access my previous flight details. My flight details aren't on United's system anymore, they think I was on a flight a whole year before I was to a completely different destination. VERY CONCERNED about their data protection and my details being associated with someone else's flights instead. This needs to be investigated",2023-01-05
"I have just been completely extorted by United Airlines. My name is Jonathan, but I booked my flight ticket under Jon, and now they're charging me approx. 50% of the entire ticket price just to re-book and change the name. Anybody in their right mind can see that Jon is a derivative of Jonathan and this is a very simple administrative error. How on earth they can charge this much extra (almost an additional £350) and still sleep at night is beyond me.The phone operative I've been speaking to has insisted there is no other option. I fully intend never to fly with United Airlines again. Meanwhile, I'm enormously disappointed with Lufthansa to have partnered with such a corrupt entity as United Airlines seem to be.No wonder their ratings are so low on here.This should be illegal.",2023-01-07
"Never before and never again!!Never ….and I mean never….in booking literally hundreds of flights for dozens of people over 15 years have I ever been denied a standard carry on! Couldn’t get a boarding pass until I paid $35 each and checked the carry on bags! The best any United rep had to say is I should have read the fine print. No waiver. No recourse. Pay or miss your flight. I’m a very even keeled guy, and respectful of service personnel….,but I’ve not been that upset in a looong time.Insult to injury, they asked multiple time for volunteers to check bags free at the gate 😡Definitely get the top-down-corporate-vibe from employees they could care less about your business….there’s another sucker in line right behind you.

"Horrible! Flight from chicago to frankfurt germany delayed 3 hours. This had a cascading effect and everything downhill from there, causing missed flights and etc. we never reached our destination city in Turkey. Towards the end we missed yet another flight and being so stressed and jet lagged and being in middle of the night we threw up our hands and gave up. We were afraid what more would go wrong in a foreign country and gave up. This is not the way customers should be made to feel! We rescheduled our entire itinerary to be in the city we ended up in, a city we never planned to be in. We had to give up our deposits for the other place. It was a nightmare which started by this one horrible flight. When will the airlines be held accountable to run on time?? Besides this, other stuff was fine so 2 stars instead of 1 but it was bad.

Eine Änderung war nicht möglich. Beim Rückflug am 22.09.22, UA030 dann die gleiche Situation. Die Plätze waren willkürlich in der Maschine verteilt. Eine Änderung wäre zwar möglich gewesen, jedoch gegen Zuzahlung von 44 Euro. Das empfinde ich als Frechheit! So einen schlechten Service habe ich bisher bei keiner anderen Airline erlebt. Beim Check-in erwarte ich schlichtweg, dass ich zwei Sitzplätze nebeneinander auswählen kann. Von diesem Chaos war übrigens die ganze Reisegruppe betroffen.

I have been trying to get my travel voucher (which was provided to me as inactive) reissued for the past month. I have spent 10 hours + on calls to United and everytime I am given different information. The company do not have a call log (so they say) and are unable to transfer me to the last person I spoke to. We even requested a call back, to which we did not receive. The fact that they cannot tell us where our money is since “they do not have the records” is frankly ridiculous. I want my money back or the voucher which was issued. The fact that a company this size are keeping my money is criminal.",2023-01-06
"Compagnie aérienne à fuir !Quelle mauvaise expérience, un cauchemar éveillé actuellement : United Airlines a annulé nos deux billets retour pour raison de ""vol annulé"". L'unique proposition possible, alors que nous sommes tenu en étau à trois jours de notre départ aux États-Unis, est un vol tôt le matin, ce qui nous enlève une journée complète de voyage. Pour le même prix alors que le billet de matin, au moment de notre réservation, était bien sûr beaucoup moins cher... Nous sommes otâges de cette compagnie, car la seule autre option c'est un remboursement, mais à quelques jours du départ, imaginez la flambée des prix...

Und die Flugbegleiter bestätigten uns, das es eine Änderung gab, damit mehr Plätze für zahlende Kunden bereit standen! Was ist das für eine Diskriminierung! Der Service war unglaublich schlecht! Unfreundlich, schlecht gelaunt und hektisch! Das Essen war das schlimmste was ich je in der Eco angeboten bekommen habe und dieser furchtbare Plastikmüll! Einmal und nie wieder United!

"I'd never recommend flying with United. My most recent experience includes working with a United Agent to cancel a leg of my flight itinerary where I received explicit confirmation from them that I would receive a full refund on that leg of the flight. The disclaimer is that I would have to submit the official refund after I finished the return leg of my flight 10 days later. That's fine and I went forward with things. Fast forward to today where it has been 3 weeks since submitting the official refund request with screenshots of my previous conversation with the United agent...they denied my refund request and instead gave me a $150 credit, which is 25% of the value that I was promised. So highly disappointed knowing that United is okay with lying to customers. I would never have cancelled my flight had I known that I wasn't going to get reimbursed.",2023-01-01

"I flew with United Airlines in December of 2022. They forced me to gate check my carry on bag. The flight was ultimately cancelled, but they did not give people back the gate checked luggage. Subsequently, they lost the bag, which is common for United Airlines. I filed a claim end of December 2022. In January/February time, when I followed up with my claim, they lied to me saying that the bag had been found and returned to me. Which it had not. Once I got that cleared up, they confirmed that I would get reimbursed for the cost of my lost items. This was meant to be paid in May - which it did not. I have been chasing since. I finally called them today, and again, they lied saying that the money should have gone into my account in July. Which, I have proof that it did not.

She said unless we wanted to fly another day, we had to listen to her. She only accepted our two suitcases when each fell 2-3 pounds below the weight limit-- again, visible by the scale. The supervisor said nothing; he just stood there and watched as this woman continued abusing us for 15 minutes.

We had a British Airways flight the same day scheduled at 12pm to Malaga, Spain. WELL, due to the FOUR hour United delay, we missed our British Airways flight.  (which means we lost $$ we paid for our flight) There were no other flights to Malaga that day, so we had to stay at a hotel in London. (Had to pay more $$ for hotel and to book another flight).  Between our hotel in London and losing money on our missed flight AND paying for another flight, the DELAYED United flight cost us an additional $2399.47!!!! After contacting United's Customer Care they gave us a whopping $200 off for future flight. Seriously? $200 compensation for $2399? They have several negative reviews from customers.

I reported my main bag as missing and was advised that it would be delivered to my house in the next few days. Fast forward to 13th April 2023 and lots of phone calls and emails later, United have admitted they have lost my bag and would be compensating me with $1900 although the contents of the lost case claim that I submitted was for $2999.

Not only did I experience delay after delay - 3.5 hours delay, they have also had to rebook my tickets twice because of this. I’ve had to fly visa Newark to get back to London. And after a long and painful flight, having returned to London Heathrow, they have lost my two checked luggages! United Airlines baggage enquiry staff told me that one of my luggages was in London and made me wait for four hours looking at carousels from other flights, in the end, I went home with zero luggages. They said my luggages will be delivered the day after, but the contact number they have provided to track your lost luggage does not work, very hard to get ahold of United Airlines customer service.

"The staff of this airline at the terminal,  is probably the most heartless I have ever had the experience of dealing with. My daughter was  traveling alone back to University and was trying very hard to navigate thru the congested security clearance which is another story, en route to the boarding gate. She arrived with boarding ticket in hand (confirmed the day prior)  and 3 minutes to spare before final boarding was done. She was told by the gentleman agent that the door is locked and she has to contact customer service. Another agent tried to intervene on her behalf to no avail, she proceeded to spend the remainder of the day between terminals on standby before a late afternoon flight which then compounded her return to University once at her destination. Very simple, there was still time to board and this was unnecessary stress. Do better United! Yes they are well aware of this grievance as I took the time to contact them directly.",2023-01-07
"Worst airline I have ever been on - even Spirit Airlines is top tier next to this one. Paid for seats that had more leg room only to find out there was no place to put our personal item; no under the seat area, and the flight attendants allowed people to use the overhead bins that were above us. Even though we were the next section right behind first class our tickets were still section”4”? Meaning we were last to board. Needless to say come takeoff 2 flight attendants were rude and said I needed to put them in an overhead bin, I asked where? As all of them were full and they said to look around. I ended up going through the entire plane to get to the back where there was a spot; it’s slightly understandable, and I’ve never had such unhelpful or rude flight attendants like that before. I would rather sit on a bus for 9+ hours than do a 1 hour flight with this airline due to the stress and exceptionally high cost. Avoid this airline if you can.",2023-01-08
"This may be just another example of how awful United Airlines is.  The flight from Minneapolis to Denver was uneventful.  The flight was late, as usual, leaving Denver.  Arrived in Durango an hour late.  Waited and waited for baggage.  It never came.  The only United person around said the only people that could help were loading another place.  After a long wait, there was finally someone to talk to.  When asked about the bag the response was, 'oh sometimes they arrive early and sometimes they arrive late.'  Another passenger said that sometimes, if they send bags early, they are up at the ticket counter.  That is where the bag was.  Wasted an hour because United has stupid and lazy people working for them and their communication sucks. And if you want to comment on how lousy they are, they offer a comments section that is so complicated that most people give up rather than waste their time writing something that probably won't get read anyway.",2023-01-05
"Actually “Not Good” is too kind for United Airlines.  They are just pathetic!  Why?   For the last 7 tickets we booked, they CANCELLED 6 of them.  They even cancelled the replacement tickets on three of them and then proceeded to place those on a standby flight.The disruption this causes and the money that is lost from their incompetence is flabbergasting.  AirBnB bookings that is too late to cancel has to be paid for regardless of the fact that we sit 12 hours at Newark, bleary eyed, hungry and frustrated.  Rental cars paid for and then new arrival times at the destination airport forces more time wasted because we have to wait for the rental car places to open.United just pulls their shoulders up and essentially goes “ megh!” when we call.  They gave us $20 for meals on the 12 hour delay at Newark, you can purchase a dry sandwich at a vending machine for that.  They partially refund hotel fairs that are lost.

"United just can’t seem to get it right... EVER!  At least we are still sitting at the gate for over an hour so I have some time to write a review.  First, we barely made it to this flight as our flight out of BNA (UA1830) was delayed and pulled into the gate in IAD 15 minutes late.  Now we are sitting in the plane at the gate for our next flight (UUA932) for over an hour.  It’s great that they decided to wait for other, delayed, connecting flights, however completely forgets people who have prior arrangements at the other side which they are now delaying.To joke and scam of an airlines, and next time I book through Lufthansa and realize it is with their partner airline, I will gladly request another flight.Don’t waist your time flying United, unless your life depends on it.  Maybe even then, but they might not get you there alive.Also, remember, the star rating system is truly only 4-Stars, meaning they have a .6 out of 4.0 for a reason.

"This is in reference to flight UA721 flying from Newark to Orlando. Avoid this airline if you can. They will delay your flight multiple times, and then they will cancel your flight (due to ""severe weather conditions,"" which from what I can see in Newark and what my husband can see in Orlando is nonsense). They have zero (I mean zero) consideration for their passangers. I actually feel embarrassed for them. They offer no food to compensate for the wait, and on top of that they have a bunch of unfriendly, unempathetic employees (the perfect employee for this pathetic excuse of an airline)--cogs that couldn't rise to the challenge to go beyond the level of a cog--working behind their counters. Their cobwebbed brains impede them from taking into consideration people's exhaustion or chronic illnesses that they might have.

I had the most horrendous experience at Newark airport. Our flight was announced as delayed. Then it was announced that it may be canceled and we should rebook our flight. Then we receive a text that the flight would leave at 2:30 at original gate. When we waited there we were told the flight number and gate number was changed and to proceed to gate 90 for a 12:30 flight. When time for boarding came they told us we were not on that flight and then had to stand in line for 2 hours to get rebooked. I have flown frequently for 30 years and never been treated like this by any other airline. This is my first and last time flying United airlines. We finally get rebooked for a flight on another airline for the next day and now we have to find our baggage that was off loaded from the plane that never took off. So we have to stand in another line for 1/2 hour to find out how to get our baggage and we are time it may take 2-3 hours or longer to retrieve it. This is a nightmare that never ends.,2023-01-05
"Vorab: wie kann man einer Airline die Schuld geben und diese schlecht bewerten, weil man zu blöd war die Einreisebestimmungen für die USA zu lesen?

Das hat der freundliche Mitarbeiter super freundlich in London erledigt.Ansonsten empfand ich die Airline als sehr dreckig und ungepflegt. Das Flugzeug selbst war nicht sehr sauber, ein Unterschied zur Lufthansa wie Tag und Nacht. Unsere grünen Koffer haben wir schwarz verdreckt zurückbekommen. Der Service am Bord war gut.Die Abwicklung in Newart NY war echt unterirdisch. Einchecken nur am Terminal möglich, die Sicherheitskontrolle eine Katastrophe, unfreundliche Menschen, die die Menschen durchschleusten wie Schweine auf den Transporter. Furchtbar!Werde nicht noch mal in die USA mit der Airline fliegen.",2023-01-06
"We recently from home from Tampa to Brussels via Dulles. Both flights were OK, but... Our connecting flight from Dulles left almost 2 hours late, allegedly because ""the incoming flight had been delayed"". Which is weird, because when I checked our luggage status on the United App it said the luggage had been put in the hold 30 minutes after we touched down in Dulles. My TV screen on the Dulles-Brussels leg didn't work. I reported this but nothing happened. Luckily there was an empty seat the other side of my wife. The food was unspeakably awful. I know airlines need to make economies to boost profits after the losses they incurred because of COVID, but this was dire. The bread rolls were like bricks. The salads looked as if they'd been prepared a week before. And the mains were simply disgusting. Couldn't eat them, they were so bad. I used to fly Continental a lot and they were really good, probably the best US carrier. Then they merged with United. Now it sucks. Next time, we'll try another airline.",2023-01-03
"Simply put, I paid United money I should never have spent with them.  I'll pay $100+ per ticket more to fly with anybody else in the future unless they finally communicate with me about the issues (not automated emails).1. Terrible, worst in my life, flight experience in June 2023.  Traveling with my family of 4.  I've flown hundreds of times and never had anything like it.2. Phone support has no authority to do - say - or help in any way, so a Supervisor gets on and says the same thing to fill out a form online and otherwise they can't help.  United takes no ownership. They solved the issue ""their way"" with a $200 credit (didn't ask for this) and won't communicate in any way otherwise. Waste of time. Waste of money.Waste of Father's Day 2023 dealing with this.My only request is reasonable, I think and so do the support reps who can't assist with it: I want a live person who cares about customers to call me and discuss my fair ask for not a full refund, but only a 1/2 refund.  Only the leg of departure.  Possible?  I doubt it with United.",2023-01-04
"Wegen Unwetter wurde unser Flug von Newark nach Washington umgeleitet. Anstelle der geplanten Landung um 13.45 Uhr waren wir nach Immigration, Koffer abholen und stundenlangem Warten am Schalter um 23 Uhr an der Reihe. Eine Umbuchung war für den Folgetag 10:10 geplant. Eine Hotelübernachtung konnte man uns allerdings für 2 Erwachsene und 2 minderjährige Kinder nicht buchen. Das sollten wir auf eigene Faust machen und die Erstattung später erhalten. Faktisch ist der Flieger am Folgetag erst um 19.15 Uhr wegen fehlendem Piloten!!! gestartet. Mit über 32 Stunden Verspätung sind wir in Newark gelandet mit dem Erfolg, dass unser Gepäck nicht in Newark ankam. Ein Gepäckstück konnten wir am Folgetag nach stundenlangem warten erhalten, ein weiteres wurde uns nach dem Urlaub (3Wochen) an die Heimatadresse zugestellt. Eines ist bis heute verschollen. Unsere Reklamationen beantwortet ein Call Center mit Standard Antworten und Floskeln, dass es ihnen leid tut. Eine Erstattung der Hotelübernachtung haben wir bis heute nicht erhalten. Das ist eine Unverschämtheit!!!",2023-01-03
"I was charged $1300 for the round trip ticket to attend my grandfather's funeral. All of my flights were delayed (one was because they had no crew), and apparently there is no in-flight entertainment offered anymore on United flights. There was no food offered other than a small bag of pretzels and a cup of water for a cross-country (5+ hour) flight, I was forced to pay $10 for Wi-Fi service that didn't work, and now I've been told United apparently have a new policy in which they don't adjust fares for bereavement travel. When I called customer service, I was forced into using the text messaging option to try to resolve my concerns due to the waiting period to speak to a representative being over 90 minutes. The United representative that I texted with was not only not helpful, but their messages were full of poor grammar, no punctuation (they often wrote paragraphs with no commas or periods or anything...it was just a run-on, nonsensical way of communicating), and a complete lack of willingness to resolve my concern(s). United has lost a customer for life.",2023-01-05
"Just another letter in the alphabet soup here, and realize the overall significance of my review may be minimal but must make my experience known. Simply put the extremely unprofessional handling, lack of experience/training, or just flat out in the wrong department, but working with Ashley in customer service at Phila airport was not next to impossible, flat out impossible. United must provide either better screening for employees or better training especially for a customer service rep on how to handle….maybe….customers!!!  As a business owner myself I would want to know if my employees conducted business in such a unprofessional detrimental manner in which Ashley clearly demonstrated, thus I am passing this along to united management and any other customer that may find themselves in the customer service office at phila int airport, and trying to express concerns with the Ashley on the other side of the counter. Thanks to Ashley I won’t fly united again, I won’t advise anyone to fly united, and look forward to doing business with southwest or American in the future.",2023-01-08
"Mit United zu fliegen ist doch jedesmal wieder interessant... mal abgesehen von der doch etwas seltsamen Boarding Routine in USA.Mein letzter Flug von SFO nach Frankfurt in der B-Class war gelinde gesagt eine Katastrophe. Sitze wie ne Hasenkiste,viel zu eng, Beine kann man zwar ausstrecken aber nach oben zu wenig Platz. Mag Ok sein für so manchen Asiaten, aber mit Körpergröße 186 cm ist das echt ne Qual. Ich lege keinen Wert auf das Speisenangebot eher auf die Beinfreiheit, aber das wahr echt ne Frechheit. Serviette hingeknallt, so wie ein Freihandwurf aus 1 m Entfernung, Tablett hingeknallt als hätte die Stewardess keinen Bock zum Servieren, Steak vorne heiss, zu heiss, hinten kalt ! Salat nicht geniesbar, weil gefroren, jep, gefroren... Rotwein ebenso a-kalt... Dann haut das Personal ständig die Servicetüren auf und zu, ging ganze 6 Stunden lang, als ob man damit Preise gewinnen könnte. Ruhe findst du da keine. Die sollten mal ne Schulung bei anderen Airlines machen, damit die wissen wie es richtig geht. Wenn es sich irgendwie vermeiden lässt, dann nie wieder United Business.",2023-01-07
"We’ve flown on our journey this summer many times with United and we were dissatisfied every time. First, they cancelled TWO Non-Stop flights of 10 hours just 2 weeks befor our trip and put us on flights with stops, that are both 5 hours. This means the plane is smaller AND less comfortable seats - so no normal first class seats, that you would expect on a 10 hour journey. On top: We could not pick our seats in first class. There were seats assigned to us and so we are now all over the plane and can not sit together. From old planes, to extremly rude and unhelpful staff - there was everything. BUT the highlight is the lounge situation. We’ve booked first class - in every normal airline this guarantees a spot in the lounge. But not with United. Because we’re flying “First INLAND” we are not allowed in the lounge. Only “First INTERNATIONAL” is allowed there. And Hawaii to New York is still inland. Thats a joke, right? We would have needed to buy a “One Day Pass” for 60 dollars per person. Such a bad customer service is unheard of. Would never fly with them again. Really really bad. And so unhelpful.",2023-01-03
"Personeel is gemeen en ongeïnteresseerd. Dorris Marlow sprak erg denigrerend naar meerdere mensen  en dreigde dat ze de beveiliging ging halen omdat we zogenaamd de regels niet opvolgden.. ze had 0 compassie voor het feit dat wij uitgeput zijn door de vertragingen en meer dan 24u wakker te zijn. In totaal hadden we 7u vertraging. We zouden vliegen van Orlando naar Washington en dan naar Amsterdam. Doordat de eerste vlucht vertraagd was hadden wij de aansluiting gemist met tientallen anderen. De rij bij de customer service duurde ontiegelijk lang. Ze wilde dat we de volgende dag gingen vliegen maar dat was voor ons geen optie. Uiteindelijk hebben we nog een vlucht kunnen vinden via Frankfurt naar AMS. Ipv dat ze dat aan ons in het begin konden vertellen. Voor hen was t makkelijker als we naar een hotel zouden gaan. Waar voor je geld krijg je niet. Een vlucht duurde 8uur en er werd maar 3x langsgelopen voor drinken… Mevrouw Marlow heeft onze stoelen toen ook nog eens veranderd zodat we niet meer naast elkaar konden zitten! Onacceptabel, ik heb gelukkig bewijs en zal het hier ook niet bij laten!!! Machtsmisbruik.",2023-01-05
"They cancelled my flight from Boston to London Heathrow on 21st August, 2023 the day of my departure and was asked to re-book. As I had checked out of my holiday accommodation I was asked to make my way to the airport to get vouchers for holiday Inn Express Hotel Boston. When I got to the airport the staff were not interested and they said that it wasn't their responsibility but because I had screenshots of all the correspondence they then gave me Hotel and meal vouchers. When I got to the hotel I was asked for details of my credit/visa card which I reluctantly gave. To cut the long story short I believe United Airlines did cancel all the vouchers and the hotel ended up charging my card. Only discovered that when I got back home to England,  tried in vain to recover my money from the hotel. Spent days phoning the hotel bearing in mind our time difference until I managed to speak to the manager who then referred me back to the airline.  Managed to lodge my claim but they keep playing mind game, send this and that which I have already supplied. Will never use that airline again. Nasty experience from going and back.",2023-01-01
"I’m not too sure whether airline carriers are regulated in the US/EU. I do know that their pricing and grading of tickets is a nightmare. The flight from Dublin to Las Vegas, via (Newark) was delayed by 1 hour. Our travel agent had booked tickets through Lufthansa, one of which was an internal US flight. Our original flights were cancelled, and a new itinerary was issued, this was done over the phone with Lufthansa. We travelled from Dublin, with no luggage, as we wanted to purchase a number of items. When trying to check in baggage with United, we were hit with a $350 charge, because our ticket was BASIC Economy, my partners bag was under 23kg, and she was hit with a $275, while mine was $75. I’m not even sure that a basic economy exists in Europe, as you just pay a fee for bringing on luggage both ways (€50). United airlines in my opinion are rip off merchants. It’s shocking a customer has to pay this, this should be highlighted on the first page of their app, but no, it’s not,  because their revenue stream is dependent on not being transparent, and ripping people off. A shocking airline, who I will NEVER fly with again!!!!",2023-01-07

"Do not fly United! The airline has significantly gone downhill. They delayed my flight repeatedly for over four hours with all passengers sitting in the airport waiting for information.  At 11 PM they ended up canceling the flight because they could not find a pilot (their fault). Passengers were told that they could retrieve their check bags, but it would take about two hours.  Minimal help was provided to rebook. To get a hotel voucher I was told to wait in a line that literally had 100 people ahead of me. They were all angry United customers who were having flight problems. I ended up spending the night at a very unsafe hotel, but that was the closest hotel to the airport that had availability. Returned to the airport at 6 AM the next morning to fly standby on the 8 AM flight. Did not make it on, but that flight is now delayed. United has reported that they need to “balance the weight of the aircraft”. But the truth is that they overfilled the aircraft with fuel, and need to burn it off before it’s safe to fly (explained by a United employee at the departure gate). I’m Still on standby. This has already cost me $100 which I highly doubt I will be reimbursed for. Save yourself the time, money, and emotional turmoil, and do not fly United!!",2023-01-05
"Ich habe den Flug bei United gebucht und erst danach habe ich die schlechten Bewertungen hier gelesen, ich habe mir eine Horror-Airline vorgestellt, hier meine Erfahrung, Flug UA46, UA47, FRA-IAH-FRA:1. United app funktioniert super gut und problemlos, warnt rechtzeitig über Verspätung, chek-in usw. Sitzplätze habe ich automatisch zugeteilt bekommen, für 2 Personen, immer nebeneinander.2. Einsteigen klappt besser und entspannter als bei der Lufthansa3. Das gesamte Personal war sehr freundlich4. Getränke sind am Board kostenlos, Essen sehr lecker ( nix mit „Essen von Zuhause mitbringen“ ), kostenloses Internet für Textnachrichten, kostenlose Filme, Kopfhörer bekommt man kostenlos, die sind aber Schrott, bringt eure eigenen mit. Mir war es kalt ( T-shirt ), Decke war ok, kein Kopfkissen bekommen. Sitzkomfort ist ok, die Rückenlehne ist gut, die Sitzfläche eher nicht, Beinfreiheit in der Holzklasse ist gut ( Ich 1,80 )5. Pünktlichkeit: Flieger ist 1 Std. später gestartet, die Ankunft war aber pünktlich! Der Rückflug war pünktlich, 40 min. früher in FRA gelandet.6. Flugzeug war relativ neu, 777-200 ( glaube ich )UA ist Star Alliance Member und die Airline gibt sich sehr viel Mühe gut zu sein. Also, stellt euch keine Horror Fluggesellschaften vor, UA ist schon OK!",2023-01-07
"Purchased ticket for my toddler and her father for an early flight. They arrived in time to check-in and get to their gate, but the employee signature of SAT-PD-QK decided they could not board because they were not there 45 minutes prior to boarding time. Their flight was at 0715. He spoke to her at around 0635. Plenty of time to get checked in and to the gate. She said it was their policy. Checked United website. No policy clearly states this. No statement in the email confirmation. Went through the process of purchasing another ticket and no prompt or or notice saying stating this apparent policy of United's minimum time. Called customer service. No help there. They said I could either be refunded and they lose their seat or I can keep them on the later flight. The supervisor with employee number: 222025448 also tried to navigate me through United site by searching, then ctrl+f'ing words to find some wording. Nothing on the site that clearly states this policy. Shame on you United. Shame on you for treating customers as pieces of crap just BECAUSE YOU CAN! Hope you all are happy with your loved ones close by and enjoying the new year. While other HUMAN BEINGS are treated this way. Happy New Year United Corporate and Employees who don't give a crap about OTHER HUMAN BEINGS!!!!",2023-01-07
"I hate United airlines, first time flying with them and last. Over 3 hour delay for things they supposedly take care of when we are waiting to board like freaking fuel! Then having to deplane after boarding then board again. Then FINALLY made it to the worst airport Birmingham,Alabama airport! We waited almost 2 hours for our luggage to come down because they said they were short staff,if they were short staff then at least allow us to get our fam bags so we can go. My foot is swollen from standing long periods, the United baggage person disappeared and didn’t come bck bc of all the complaints. They were elderly people, pregnant women and others like myself with health problems and no chair to sit, no customer service support and my husband called and was told they always do stuff like that, the f…k! Who cares you are short staff just give us our dam luggage. Birmingham Alabama airport with United airlines you are taking a chance on something happening. Hell they might forget their dam pilot! The worst experience in my life with flying and I fly very often. Never United because they ain’t uniting anyone or thing, United airlines is the absolute Worst. Please consider anyone but them when traveling unless you don’t mind people wasting a lot of your time. They could of offer to send us our luggage or something besides they awful service they provide,",2023-01-06
"I have flown well over a million miles with United and have had 1K status for many years. Before the pandemic I had 120 plus points canceled since there is a 1 year time limit on them. You can use these points to upgrade which rarely happens. I have another 80 points due to be canceled this month and reached out to see if I could extend the expiration to no avail!I traveled over 100K miles last year with United and tried to upgrade using these points but was never able to for whatever reason which is solely in United's control. What is the point of having this so-called benefit, if United controls it and there is an expiration date on it?I do get pre-boarding benefits which is last in a long list of other pre-boarding groups. I do get complimentary economy plus seating which is a smidgen better than economy but for international trips they are not very comfortable either.The ground staff is not very pleasant and crew on the plane treat passengers like cattle compared to other international airlines where service is much better, and quality of the food and entertainment is better.Unfortunately, I am vested and switching gears this late in the game doesn't make sense; if another airline offered to take my status and points and such over I would without hesitation switch and be loyal to them as I have been to United. If you do not have any status with United, does not make much sense to travel with them unless circumstances warrant it.Hope this helps someone.",2023-01-07
"We booked a flight for Cozumel leaving NWA on 05/09/23 at 6:45 am.   We received a text 05/08/23 at 9:50 pm almost 9 hours prior to our flight of possibly storms.  Unreal.   We spent several hours trying to get everything rebooked which we did for the following morning for a 6:45 am departure. Our 2nd attempt to fly out the following morning we woke up at 3:30 am to a text stating our Houston connection was delayed 1 hour and 15 minutes due to mechanical issues and our replacement plane would arrive from Mexico. While waiting to board our first flight in NWA and the agent stated our NWA plane is now delayed around 30 minutes.  We finally board and arrive in Houston, the replacement plane arrives, we were told it is now delayed due to mechanical issues.  We had over a two hour delay here. All this on top of canceling our flight from the day before which did not have storms anywhere around us.  When we did fly out we had storms we flew into and out of in Houston.  We lost an entire day at our resort as well as stress and time getting everything resolved.  We will never fly United again.   One last thing the website said we could not bring a normal sized carry on in the plane.  It had to be something size wise like a 12 inch purse.  If we tried to bring a normal sized carry on we’d be charged $35 to check it at the gate.  When we arrived we saw others who had the larger carry on’s and were allowed to board with them.  The agent said the plane had  enough room for 25 regular size carry on bags.",2023-01-06
"Unfreundlich.. Schmuddelig… Verspätet…So etwas erlebt man wirklich nicht oft und hätte ich gewusst was das für ein unangenehmer Flug wird hätte ich 200Euro mehr für eine andere Airline bezahlt. Es fing schon an am Gate in San Francisco. Eine unglaublich unverschämte Frau wies uns an (und damit meine ich schreite rum) wie wir uns aufstellen sollten. Einen Sinn oder eine Logik konnte ich dabei nicht erkennen. Wenn dann mal jemand etwas falsch verstanden hat, schrie sie die Person schon fast an und sagte Dinge wie „vielleicht sollten sie mal lernen zu zuhören“ oder „sind sie etwas dumm“. Also das war wirklich eine Umverschämtheit. Als wir dann alle im Flieger waren mussten wir 50 Minuten warten. Niemand informierte uns wann es losgeht. Die Sitze und Reihen waren so eng wie in einem Kurzstrecken-Billig-Flieger-, die Kissen und Decken waren ein Witz, das Essen kam teilweise schon offen auf das Tablett, und auch was es genau gab wurde auch auf Nachfrage nur mit „Chicken“ oder „Pasta“ beantwortet. Aber die Absolute Krönung war Unfreundlichkeit und Lustlosigkeit des Personals. Wie sehr das Personal uns Passagiere nicht mochte war klar. Denn egal was man bestellte oder wie freundlich am war man bekam immer ein Augenrollen. Die Dame schräg neben mir frage nach einer Serviette und diese wurde ihr nur zugeworfen und landet auf dem Boden. Als wir endlich gelandet sind mussten wir noch 50 Minuten im Flieger warten. Warum sagte uns niemand. Ich glaube viele Menschen haben ihren Anschlussflug verpasst. Nie wieder United Airlines!!!!",2023-01-05
"I am a disabled person who travels with a mobility scooter. I proactively notified the ""Special Needs"" department and filled out the (customer wheelchair information) form relative to my scooter. In spite of my efforts to make it easy every flight began with mayhem. I found ALL the United gate agents lacked the knowledge / training when presented with my (common) scooter. In comparison, I have taken numerous international trips with Delta and American without any scooter related difficulties. The crowning blow occurred at the Brussels airport where I missed my connection due to an inexcusable wait for an aisle chair, (needed to get me off the plane). The (aisle chair) attendants tried their best to make up the time by rushing me through Customs and speeding through the airport while keeping their dispatcher informed of our ETA to the gate. Two family members, traveling with me to help, went ahead to the gate along with my carry-on bag and crutches, while I waited to get off the plane. They were already at the gate and checked in but would not board without me. As soon as I arrived the gate agents told my family ""Okay he's here, get on the plane!"" then they closed the gate IN MY FACE and my family /helpers were not allowed to leave the plane. Nine hours and two flights later I arrived at my destination. Additionally, on my return flight to IAD, United personal misplaced my scooter and it took them and hour to find it. I have deleted the United App from my phone as I cannot imagine ever needing it again. Confirmation #NE4ZN1",2023-01-06
"Hi my name is Rasmus. My family and I was traveling with united from Germany to Honduras the 16th of March this year. First we get told to pick up our luggage when we get to Houston, but our luggage never shows up, we ask a worker what to do and get told that our luggage will go automatically to our connection flight, that sounds great.. When we get to Honduras surprise surprise NO luggage.. We go talk to a worker from united and we explain how the bag looks like and so on.. She says that it is in Houston, okay no problem we will get it tomorrow then, we expect.. Then next day when we call them it turns out that it's in Germany now, so we have to wait some more days.. Then when it's coming and they bring it to us it's not our luggage, yes it has our tag on it but the tag is loose and the bag don't look anything like what we told them. So after many calls to united here in Honduras and the States we still don't have our luggage and have no idea if they will ever find it.. You can just buy what you need at save the receipt they tell us, why do you think we bring stuff from Europe to Honduras, maybe because you CAN'T find that stuff here. Plus we also bring stuff that means a lot to us that you can't put a price on. And who knows if we ever get money from united to cover the cost..?We offer to sent them a picture of the luggage but they don't want or are able to receive photos.. So now we are just calling every day and listen to the same excuse.. But we will not give up..So I can't recommend to travel with United. Stay away from them if you don't want trouble.",2023-01-07

Merci beaucoup !En ce qui concerne les vols 1 h de retard à cancun et 2h de retard à New York, nous avons donc loupé notre correspondance à Bruxelles.

Nous sommes réorienté au chek in de United Airlines et nous nous faisons agresser car soit disant nous avions mis trop de temps à arriver alors que notre avion a atterri à 9h30 au lieu de 8h05 pour un décollage vers Toulouse à 9h50. De plus cela faisait plus d’une heure que nous essayons d’avoir le billet de mon conjoint. Donc ce n’était pas un retard de notre faute car mon billet était bon c’était une erreur de la compagnie. Bref au final nous avons pu prendre le vol Bruxelles Toulouse de 21h, nous avons attendu plus de 12 heures à l’aéroport sans geste commercial ni excuse de la part de la compagnie.

"Wir haben äußerst miserable Erfahrungen gemacht und werden garantiert nicht mehr mit UA fliegen: Unser Flug wurde, neben mehreren anderen von Newark nach Frankfurt gecancelt. Bevor uns das mitgeteilt wurde aber stundenlanges Hinhalten mit der angeblichen Aussicht es würde weitergehen und sich lediglich verzögern, keine Informationen, keine Transparenz darüber, was los ist. Stündlich wurden andere Argumente angebracht, darunter Säuberung des Flugzeuges, abgelaufene Nahrungspakete, Überstunden von Piloten, Betankung des Flugzeuges. Erst nach einigen Beschwerden argumentierte UA mit einem Tornado, den lediglich die Angestellten von UA wahrgenommen haben, aber keiner der Passagiere! Niemand will bei realistischer Gefahr in ein Flugzeug steigen! Ich begrüße es natürlich, wenn derart rücksichtsvoll und vorausschauend gehandelt wird. Da wir aber für unseren Flug online vorher nicht einchecken konnten, stattdessen ein Angebot bekommen haben gegen Gutschein unseren Flug zu verschieben und weil im Falle eines Unwetters keinerlei Entschädigung gezahlt werden muss, kommt natürlich der Gedanke, dass der Fehler (z.B. einer Überbuchung) bereits vorher bekannt war und nach Ausreden gesucht wurde. Unabhängig davon gab es kein Entgegenkommen mit Verpflegung, Gutschein, Betten oder anderen kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten. Stattdessen stundenlanges Warten in einer Schlange. Bessere Behandlung konnte durch Aufpreis für die Members Lounge erkauft werden. Am Ende: ausgebuchte Alternativen, 1-2 Tage verspätete Ankünfte und verschwundenes Gepäck bei nahezu allen Passagieren unseres Fluges! Wir hatten einen tollen Trip in NY, aber der Rückflug und die Behandlung durch UA hinterlassen bittere Spuren und kosten vor allem VIEL Geld!",2023-01-06
"Dear United Airlines,This is what I wrote to United without a response from them. Gave them a second shot and our plane was delayed for 6 hours we were forced to get another airlines flight home and they didn't pay until I complaine they gave me a $200.00 credit for an $1100.00 round trip telling me the flight home was cheaper. Lies!!!!I am writing to express my disappointment as a first-time flyer with your airline. I recently sent a complaint letter regarding my experience and received a reply, but unfortunately, it did not fully address my concerns.My first impression of United Airlines was not a positive one. Despite arriving at the airport well ahead of my flight, I encountered long lines and inefficiency at the check-in counter. The process was confusing, and the staff seemed uninterested in assisting me. This was a significant letdown as I was excited to take my first flight with United Airlines.Additionally, during my flight, I experienced several issues, such as cramped seating, subpar in-flight entertainment, and delayed service. The lack of comfort and convenience made my experience less than desirable.I understand that some of these issues may be beyond your control, but as a customer, I expect a high level of service and comfort. The fact that my experience was not up to par was particularly disappointing as I had high expectations for United Airlines.I would like to request that my concerns be taken seriously and addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner. As a first-time flyer, my experience will impact my future travel decisions, and I hope that United Airlines can take the necessary steps to improve the customer experience.Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you.",2023-01-01
"Before you read this all, GO WITH A DIFFERENT AIRLINE...got a ticket with connecting flight from Munich to texas then baton rouge. Their customer service sucked. My flight was delayed for two hours which left me only five minutes to get on the next plane. They tried giving me another ticket to two other states in which i would have to pick up my own luggage (that is 50 lbs each) because of their fault. I went back in the line in hopes of talking to a flight attendant crying but they said that they didn't have time to deal with that. I finally got my old ticket back to texas but it was delayed again which got me stuck in texas. it wasn't any different on the plane either. they had problems taking off and the flight attendants were pretty rude. When I asked them if i could sit by the window to get comfier which no one else was sitting there before I could finish my sentence the flight attendance mockingly smiled and said no you can't. Like I was a burden to them like I didn't just pay 1500 dollars for that damn airline. the seats were too narrow and uncomfortable too. I felt like a horse trying to sleep on the plane and spent the whole 16 hours flight crying because of their rudeness and ignorance. . My friend had to drive for 5 hours to pick me up from texas and when I was trying to find my suitcase, they said there was only one showing in the system although I had two. I had paid extra to bring two luggage instead of one. They said they lost my suitcase and that it was still in Munich. I started panicking like everything that could go wrong went wrong. They weren't willing to compensate or work with me, I had to spend hours with a heavy carry-on back on my shoulder because of their arrogance. WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST STAYING AWAY!!!!!",2023-01-08

Hoffnungslos überfordertes Bodenpersonal Vorort von United Airlines, Stundenlanges warten auf Informationen (die dann vorsätzlich falsch waren und in einer unnachahmlichen Gleichgültigkeit vorgetragen wurde). Fazit: mit ca. 30 weiteren betroffenen Personen haben wir auf dem Boden im Flughafen übernachtet. Am nächsten Tag ging das Trauerspiel weiter. Der Ersatzflug gegen 06:30 wurde gecancelt, der Flug UA 3030 von 10:00 Uhr verzögerte sich auf ca. 19:30 Abflug (davon saßen wir ca. 6,5 Stunden im Flieger ohne Catering), kein Voucher, / nix - nur die Bitte um Verständnis)! Niemand von United Airlines hat ein ernsthaftes Verständnis für unseren Schaden und unsere Situation gezeigt: 2 Tage Urlaub in NY =weg, Rundreise umplanen, 40 Stunden unverschuldetes Warten mit Übernachtungsaufenthalt (ohne Schlaf) mit der Familie auf dem Fußboden im Flughafen, Folgekosten allerorts und vor allem die massive Beeinträchtigung der Urlaubsqualität (Stress-/Erholungsfaktor) auch durch die gespürte Enttäuschung der Kinder. Vieles verschuldet durch United Airlines und durch eine Vielzahl derer Mitarbeiter, die sich die Note ungenügend durch Lügen, Arroganz, Desinteresse, vermisstes Verantwortungsbewusstsein und Lösungskompetenz mehr als verdient haben. Ein Armutszeugnis für die Verantwortlichen und die Geschäftsführung von United Airlines. Ich bin mal gespannt, wie sie mit der Kritik / den Erfahrungsberichten umgehen werden.",2023-01-05
"We traveled from Copenhagen to Dallas in mid-December and our bags were lost; we eventually got our bags back 6 days later. But we had to purchase clothing, winter coats, toiletries, etc that amounted o over $1200 between the two of us. I submitted the claim in early January and was told we would receive the reimbursement within 30-60 business days. Nothing came until late May (1.5 months late) AND they made an error. We only received $180 because United didn't transfer the correct currency to my Danish account. I emailed United right away and was told the remaining balance would be transferred, give it 2-3 more weeks. Nothing came.July comes. I've called muliple United agents. Each time I spend 30+ minutes on the phone going back through everything, explaining how I was sent the wrong amount. My case was escalated by a manager in August; nothing happened. My case was excalated in September; nothing happened. I'm given the run-around, promised updates via email and phone calls, of course, no transfer happened.It's October 9, 10 months later, and once again I am on the phone with an agent (40 minutes this ime) arguing for the money owed and promised. The latest lie is that since an agent offered me a $300 United voucher for the incredibily long processing time, my case is closed because I ""settled"" for the voucher. Who in their right mind would settle for a voucher that's 1/4 the amount rightfully owed them? I don't plan to fly United ever again; give me a voucher, don't give me a voucher... I don't care. Your customer service is appauling and I deserve the money owed to me.We had to spend a lot of money on things we didn't plan for just before Christmas. Plus the stress of shopping for essentials, tracking our suitcases, wondering if the gifts we brought from Denmark would make it in time or at all. How can you treat your customers like this? You have the money and resources; you need to do better.",2023-01-01
"10/6/23 UA85 was delayed in Orlando due to fuelling and bad weather. In Newark we were held longer on the plane, I missed flight UA90 to TLV by 7 minutes. Other flights gotten cancelled by UA, So the lines of people needing services were ridiculous, as well as the hostile environment created by United airlines employees who were brought from other departments to serve as “customer service”. UA ran out of hotel vouchers. 6/11/23 UA84 was successful. I however missed my medical procedure, $1000 I paid towards, and therefore the whole purpose of my trip. I also lost my reserved seats in favour of an isle middle seat. 6/28/23 UA85 was an hour delayed due to cleaning. I couldn’t lay back my seat and suffered from chair kicking throughout the flight. UA1402 was canceled due to unexpected operational issue. I put myself on standby for UA1695 and lost due to another delay and a jammed carousel. I had to cancel all my 6/29/23 patients while facing the unending lines, desperate calls for assistance from unprofessional UA system and employees who seem to get worse. United airlines phone representatives are being recorded thus possibly more helpful to put me on a flight that a guy from customer service -Newark (David s.) refused to locate and put me on. He said without looking in his computers that there aren’t flights to Florida the next 4 days, also he doesn’t have to provide me this service. All of his colleagues made me feel invisible and were ignoring me due my justified doubt and frustration (Despite being polite). 6/29/23 UA735 left 10 minutes late and 1 change of gate, an error code with my ticket wouldn’t allow me to print a label after checked in online. UA2636 departed as expected. I reserved seats to avoid risks and get back on time to pick up my children (single mom here). there were available seats on both flights. Taking the loss and damages I have suffered into account, I am kindly requesting United airlines to refund all my airfare expenses of  $1737.87",2023-01-05
"Vol de Paris vers Washington réservé pour une famille de 3 personnes dont 1 mineur de 13 ans avec 5 mois d'avance.2 mois avant le vol, 2ème confirmation de vol avec cette fois 3 sièges pré-attribués côte-à-côte pour voyager ensemble.A l'enregistrement en ligne, 3 sièges attribués automatiquement à 10 rangées de différence chacun ! Pour se remettre ensemble, il faut sélectionner des sièges vendus à 250 dollars US chacun. Soit 750 dollars pour voler en famille pendant 8h, plus cher que le prix du billet + taxes !Au bureau d'enregistrement de la compagnie 3h30 avant le vol, l'hôtesse refuse de redonner 3 places ensemble alors que nous sommes parmi les premiers arrivés. ""Il ne faudrait pas qu'on soit plusieurs à toucher aux réservations de fauteuils, voyez çà à la porte d'embarquement"". Ben oui, quand toutes les places seront définitivement attribuées, ce sera certainement plus facile !A la porte d'embarquement, le personnel United est sous le stress car ils ont plusieurs familles à rassembler comme nous, plus d'autres questions à gérer, plus d'autres problèmes de services à l'avion en même temps. Le chef d'escale et l'hôtesse qui l'assiste ont plusieurs billets et passeports dans la main, alpaguent certains passagers pour leur proposer de changer de place afin d'aider des familles. United sépare les familles et stresse son personnel, tout çà pour essayer de vendre des réservations de sièges à 250 dollars, c'est de toute beauté.Le chef d'escale n'a réussi à rassembler que 2 autres familles en priorité à cause de l'âge encore plus petit des enfants qui étaient aussi séparés de leurs parents.Une fois tout le monde dans l'avion, le chef d'escale revient en courant à bord et annonce à ma femme qu'une personne ne s'est pas présentée à l'embarquement, avec un autre changement de place, il peut mettre ma femme à côté de ma fille.Moi je reste éloigné pendant 8h, à côté d'autres personnes qui se parlent entre rangées, également séparés par United AIrlines à l'enregistrement.SEPARATED Airlines sera mieux, changez de nom !!",2023-01-03
"Værste flyselskab i verden!Vi fløj med United 21 juli 2022 (!!!) med en 2 årig og da vi kom frem havde de mistet vores klapvogn. Ferien blev i særdeleshed forringet, da vi ikke kunne gå ligeså langt med en 2 årig uden klapvogn, og da jeg kom hjem sendte jeg en ""bagage-claim"". Siden da er jeg blevet løjet op i ansigtet flere gange end jeg kan tælle. United starter med at sige at det tager 30-45 arbejdsdage at behandle sagen og derfra får man sine penge hvis der er medhold.Efter 1 ½ måned er det lykkedes dem at lokalisere den ene del af klapvognen og den anden er væk. Så jeg finder dokumentation på prisen for den 2. del af Emmaljunga klapvognen, og beløbet er 550 Dollars. Det sender jeg midt oktober.Jeg hører intet fra dem i en måned og først 3. gang jeg ringer i løbet af den måned, kan deres medarbejder komme videre med sagen og bekræfter at jeg får kompensation og sender en mail som jeg skal besvare med mine bankoplysninger.Derfra skulle jeg modtage mine penge... men nej.  Nu sidder jeg så her 10 januar 2023 og har talt med dem 10-15 gange i telefonen omkring kompensation af vores klapvogn.Pengene er selvfølgelig ikke kommet, fordi de ""sidder"" fast i en anden afdeling.De har ingen mulighed for at de kan sende mails hvor de bekræfter det de har sagt i telefonen.. men de kan godt sende mails hvor de beder om bankoplysninger. Meget mystisk, at de ikke vil dokumentere det de siger i telefonen, men godt kan sende mails vedr. andre ting.Jeg er glad for jeg ikke sidder i kørestol, for så havde jeg ikke haft en kørestol i et halvt år!!Tænk at drive virksomhed sådan her.. Bevidst lyve og prøve at kører sine kunder trætte, ved at skulle sidde 1 time i kø til deres kundeservice hver gang. Og for hvad? for at de kan spare end kompensation på 550 dollars. De 550 dollars er i øvrigt udelukkende kompensation for klapvognen, og man får ikke 1 øre mere, selvom de ødelagde ferien, man har været ude klapvogn i et halvt år, har ringet 10-15 gange  og siddet 1 time i kø til kundeservice.Hold jer væk for århundredes største scam virksomhed",2023-01-07
We booked flights from Edinburgh to Newark leaving on 16 May returning from Nashville to Edinburgh on 16 June as part of a special trip to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. The flight going out was delayed for hours! We were left sitting on the plane and they stopped people getting on the flight. They then started asking for passengers to give up their seats. They had obviously overbooked the flight and it was just chaos. Eventually we took off but were told as the plane was heavier than it should be it would take longer to get to Newark. As a nervous flier this was a bit worrying! Great start to our holiday! When we tried to check in for our return flight on 14 June we couldn’t find our booking on their website albeit we had confirmation from when we booked several months earlier. It was impossible to get through on the telephone to speak with anyone so we had to get a taxi to the airport to try and sort this out. United do not have a customer service desk so the only way we could speak with someone was to stand in the check in queue for an hour. When we explained we had booked flights for the next day but were unable to find our booking the female assistant just took our paperwork and started looking on the computer. She didn’t say one word to us! After twenty minutes she handed us a piece of paper which indicated we were back on the flight but with no booked seats (we had our seats booked originally). There was no reason given as to why this had happened and no apology. We had to get a taxi back to our accommodation and spent the next couple of hours trying to get our seats sorted out. This was the last day of our holiday and it was completely ruined by their inefficiency. It was such a stressful day and caused a lot of upset. I contacted United complaints on our return and eventually received an apology but no reason for what had happened or offer of compensation. When I asked again why we had been removed from this flight they completely ignored me. How do they manage to get away with this atrocious service?!? Could never recommend them and won’t use them again.,2023-01-08
"BEWARE OF UNITED AIRLINES, AND AIR CANADAOn July 15, I hired Kathy Gill, Busy Time Travel, Avoya Network to become my agent regarding an upcoming trip to Churchill Manitoba. She arranged flights with United Airlines and Air Canada for November 1, 2022.  Twice my flight were cancelled. Neither time my flight was rescheduled, nor did the airlines notify me. On October 11, I called Air Canada to ask which gate I should arrive at. They told me that my flight had been cancelled on Sept. 12.  Had I not contacted Air Canada about departure information, I would not have known. I spent hours with both airlines in the next two days. I was charged another $163 from Air Canada. I had to purchase new flights to Winnipeg. United told me I was due a refund of $26, and refused to give it to me. I informed both United and Air Canada that only I be allowed to make any further changes. They agreed.On October 31, Gill emailed me. She stated my entire, original $805 United/Air Canada charge was disputed by me. It was not. Once again, I had to call the airlines to confirm that her allegations were incorrect. Once again, much more wasted time and stress.Again, on October 31, less than 13 hours before my departure, Gill cancelled my flights with United and Air Canada. The airlines never informed me. They allowed Gill to cancel the flights that I made on October 11, despite their assurances that Gill would noy be allowed to intervene. I spent hours again on the telephone hours before departure hoping that I would be allowed to depart.  This new flight resulted in a three hour earlier departure, with an extra stop in Chicago. On November 1, I had to spend more of my vacation time trying to arrange another flight home.On October 12, I sent a letter to the Scott Kirby, the CEO of United. A copy is enclosed. I also emailed a letter to Michael Rousseau, the CEO of Air Canada. Of course, neither responded.These airlines have caused me many, many hours of work, stress and extra expenses. This has been a pitiful experience for me. They have nearly sabotaged my entire $8000 trip to Churchill, Manitoba.I believe that I am eligible for compensation and refunds.",2023-01-07
"I'm EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED!! It's UNACCEPTABLE! I was stuck in Newark Airport, NY for over 40 hours, due to a flight cancellation. Rebooked in for a new flight, 40+ hours was the wait. Newark was my connecting flight location. Toronto was my final destination. Before finding out about my cancelled connected flight, my check in baggage was rechecked in. Since I was spending over 40 hours in the airport, I actually spoke to UNITED Baggage Counter Service 3 TIMES! To know the whereabouts of my bag, and I wanted it with me during my wait in the Airport. The 1st time, I was told that even though my bag was rerouted, I could collect it and have it with me, then I could recheck it in before boarding my new flight to Toronto. I was told to do this by visiting baggage service the next day. The next day is here, it is my 2nd time. I was told it'll take 12 hours for me to retrieve it, ""look out for it at carousel 9"" I was told. And I could recheck it in. The 3rd and final time I spoke to Baggage Counter Service, this person behind the counter told me something completely different, he said that since my bag has been rerouted, I no longer have access to it until my final destination. And I was PROMISED that it will be with me on my new Toronto flight. 3 times, with 3 different answers. PICK A REASON! Saying that, luckily I saw my luggage on carousel belt 9, attached with the reroute label and all. I picked it up to get my phone charger which I really needed. I asked one of the baggage workers if I could keep my bag with me and I will recheck it in. They said NO. It's in the system, and it's guaranteed to be with you. I finally landed in Toronto and what do you know. Not only did my bag not show up, but I found out that it's still in Newark Airport!! I know this because UNITED Baggage service in Toronto tracked it for me. Look, cleary you can tell I'm annoyed and angry at this point, who wouldn't be?? Having been already frustrated waiting around for 40+ hours, now I have to deal with another problem. Again, I was GUARANTEED that it will be with me. I've already made arrangements to get it delivered to an address, it'll take 2-3 days for me to receive it. But this is still UNACCEPTABLE!! I was PROMISED TWICE that it'll be with me and be taken care of. Basically, I was mislead and LIED TO IN MY FACE!! I 100% deserve compensation for this!",2023-01-05
"War geschäftlich eine Woche in den USA. Hinflug FRA-ORD, Rückflug IAD-FRA. Gebucht wurde alles über LH, der  Hinflug auf von Lufthansa durchgeführt, bei dem es nichts zu beanstanden gab. Freundliches Personal, bequeme Sitze, gutes Essen, regelmäßiger! Service, wie man das von LH kennt. Der Rückflug wurde dann von UA durchgeführt und wie soll man sagen...mangelhaft würde dieser bodenlosen Frechheit nicht gerecht. Es fing beim Boarding bereits an. Am Gate stand eine! Mitarbeiterin, welche im Minutentakt die Passagiere in einem Befehlston auf die Notwendigkeit der Prüfung Ihrer Pässe hinwies. Bei ihr am Schalter sagte sie dann, dass dies nicht erforderlich sei. Nachdem das Boarding eigentlich schon seit 40 min hätte abgeschlossen sein sollen, wurde es (ohne Ankündigung der Verspätung begonnen). Es kam dann eine 2. Mitarbeiterin hinzu, welche sich allerdings offensichtlich noch in der Ausbildung befand. Man eröffnete uns dann schließlich, dass man ein neues System der US-Grenzbehörde teste. Konkrete bedeutete dies, dass jeder Passagier einzeln in eine Kamera schauen und seinen Pass Einscannen sollte. Bei einer komplett ausgebuchten Boeing 777 mit mehr als 400 Passagieren und einem Kamerasystem, kann man sich ausmalen, wie lange dies dauert. Irgendwann wurde dies dann abgebrochen und ""normal"" geboardet. Im Flugzeug wurde es dann noch schlimmer. Mein Platz in der Premium Eco unterschied sich von denen in der normalen Eco nur durch die Farbe des Sitzes. Selbst für eine ""normale"" Eco waren diese Sitze für einen Langstreckenflug eine Katastrophe. Kennt man von anderen Airlines von der Kurzstrecke. Handgepäck wurde teilweise über das ganze Flugzeug verteilt. Nach dem Start gab es etwas zu essen und zu trinken, dann nochmal ein kurzer Service, bei dem eine kleine Flasche Wasser verteilt wurde. Dann ging das Licht aus und 7,5 h später wieder an. In dieser Zeit gab es keinen Service. Erst kurz vor Frankfurt wieder. In der Boardküche war in dieser Zeit auch kein Crewmitglied zu finden, geschweige denn, dass dort etwas zu trinken bereitgestanden hätte. Naja 100ml Wasser und ein Becher Cola mussten dann wohl reichen für 8h.Man frag sich an dieser Stelle ernsthaft, wieso sich UA (noch) in der Star Alliance befindet. Dieser katastrophale Service färbt damit dann leider auch auf andere Airlines ab, insbesondere wenn man den Flug bei Lufthansa gebucht hat.Mein Fazit:einmal und nie wieder. Künftig werde ich darauf achten, keinen Flug mehr zu wählen, der von United durchgeführt wird. Und liebe Lufthansa, macht euch mal Gedanken über eure Kooperationspartner.",2023-01-05
"I'm writing this review to share my recent travel experience with United Airlines, which unfortunately left me deeply dissatisfied. I had booked a flight from Graz (GRZ) to San Jose (SJO), and to say the least, the journey was filled with a series of unfortunate events that disrupted both my personal and professional commitments.Firstly, I encountered significant disruptions due to frequent rescheduling of my outbound flight. The flight was rescheduled thrice, delaying my departure by two full days. Such frequent changes in schedule demonstrated a lack of coordination and consideration for passengers. While I understand that certain situations may necessitate adjustments, the frequency of these changes was far from acceptable.In addition to this, my return flight was also subject to an unanticipated time change. I was not provided with any prior notification or explanation for this alteration. Being forced to adjust to such changes at the last minute added an unnecessary layer of stress and inconvenience to an already fraught journey.Regrettably, the issues didn't end with scheduling problems. During my journey to San José, United Airlines misplaced my checked baggage, causing a delay of several days before I could retrieve my personal belongings. This was not only unprofessional but also deeply unsettling, as I was left without my belongings for an extended period.To compound these issues, one of my flights experienced an astonishing seven-hour delay. The absence of viable re-accommodation options or any form of compensation during this prolonged delay was, in my opinion, a clear demonstration of poor customer service.As a frequent flyer with United Airlines, I was taken aback by the glaring lack of professionalism and customer care throughout this journey. The series of events, including repeated rescheduling, extensive delays, mishandling of baggage, and poor communication, have severely tainted my perception of the airline.Given the magnitude of these issues, I believe it's imperative that United Airlines conducts a thorough investigation to prevent such incidents in the future. I also hope to see a fair and satisfactory resolution to compensate for the distress and inconvenience caused by these unfortunate incidents.In conclusion, this recent experience has significantly shaken my trust in United Airlines, a company I once regarded for its commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction. I look forward to seeing how they address these concerns and hope that they take necessary steps to improve their service quality for the benefit of all passengers.",2023-01-06
"Literally just the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Flight was delayed out of EWR for almost 9 hours in one hour increments, during which passengers were left on their own while gate staff disappeared. When they were there, inquiries were met with either snotty remarks, attitude, or ""we don't know"", and advice ranged from ""call the toll free number"", ""go to terminal C and ask them"", or ""sit tight."" Staff was never up front without us about the reason for the delay, and kept changing stories when they did finally decide to tell us anything. Finally, the captain, a stand up guy, came out and spoke to us, but by then we'd all been sitting around for about 10 hours. Missed a business event because by the time staff decided to be honest, all the flights for the next day were booked. My colleague had to cover it alone. Once flight was canceled, we were told to go pick up our luggage on the baggage carousel. When it wasn't there, we were told there was no one to unload it until the next morning, 5-7 hours later. The entire flight had to wait in line to speak to a baggage clerk. It was now 230 am. When I got up there, the curmudgeon who waited on me barely made eye contact, didn't seem to care that I'd been up about 24 hours by then, and gave me attitude when I apparently used the wrong term to describe what I wanted (my bag delivered to my home so I didn't have to sleep on the floor of Newark airport to wait for it). Hint: If you don't like people, don't work in customer service! My friend actually went to EWR in person over a week after I was told the bag would be sent to my home in about 48 hours and was told the bag would be on carousel 9. After she spent about 5 hours total waiting, she was then told it was being shipped to my home. Had to buy a ton of things to replace items in my bag because no one would give me any idea when it might arrive. Customer service on phone said I could file for reimbursement. The bag finally arrived 12 days after the flight had been canceled. Remains to be seen whether I will be reimbursed. Abysmal, disgusting. How they are still in business is beyond me, but I imagine it's because no one can actually contact them to get a refund! Between waiting on line for a chat and the phone I may have literally spent the equivalent of  an entire work week waiting. News flash: customers have jobs and cant spend 3 hours on hold waiting for an update from customer service reps who also have jobs, but apparently prefer not to do them but instead tell us literally anything that comes to mind. I even wrote the CEO on the night this all started. Not that I expected him to respond, but even a form response would have been nice. They offered me 30K miles for me to forget the whole thing, but why on earth would I ever fly them again? At least not by choice! Horrid, wretched, third world level operation. Delta looks even better now!",2023-01-05
"My flight with United Airlines was from Washington DC to Buffalo NY.I am so disappointed on how my return flight on the 9th of September 19.59pm  was cancelled last minute.This was a special trip to visit the Niagara Falls for my wife’s birthday which ended up being horrible.I would like to start off with saying how I have heard very good feedback about United Airline which is why I decided to book this airline as a birthday present for my wife, however I am very disappointed with my experience and the service I received.My flight was cancelled at the airport after waiting at the airport for over 3 hours which no prior notice and I was not given any support or guidance from any of your ground staff members at the airport. This made my journey extremely more stressful as I was a complete stranger and a tourist. This was my very first time visiting Buffalo NY. I only came to Buffalo NY to visit the Niagara Falls with a stay for only one night and this cancellation has made my journey very stressful and has really impacted me and my wife’s mental health. I am over the age of 50 and this put me under a lot of pressure and stress which increased my heart beat quite a lot, I however kept my courage as I needed to go home to my kids. We were forced to take a cab back to our destination which was very expensive as it cost me $730. I had no other option as I had my flight going back to the United Kingdom the very next day from Washington Dulles to London Gatwick on the 10th September 2023. I could not miss this flight as I was going back home as I had left my kids back home. This was a very scary experience for me as it was midnight, and as a tourist we had no idea of even how to book a taxi in a foreign country, to make matters worse I also did not have any internet connection and your staff members were also not supportive in helping us at all.To conclude, this resulted in us not enjoying our last day of our holiday or being able to any of the activities we originally planned. This has also affected my mental health and caused a lot of anxiety for myself and my wife as we were stranded at the airport at mid night with no where to go or any support from your staff members. We were not provided with a hotel or any other means of transportation or flights to take us back to our destination. I also did inform your ground staff of my return flight to the united kingdom, they however still not support me and ignored my request to receive help.Please kindly review this and advise on available compensation as we honestly have had a terrible experience on such a joyous moment in our life.I am also not going to recommend your airline to anyone going forward due to my experience.I want to mention I still have not yet received a refund for my cancelled flight, this was something that was promised to us from your ground staff. They informed me that I would automatically receive a full refund.",2023-01-02
"Shocking experience with United Airlines, who left our family including 2 elderly people and an infant stranded in Boston over the Boston Marathon weekend for 2 days. We incurred over $1,000 in extra hotel and food costs, and United refused to compensate us even one cent in violation of Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations!On the morning of our scheduled departure, United told us the Boston-Newark leg of our journey (United 523) was delayed because of an earlier delay impacting our plane’s arrival, meaning we would not have sufficient time to make our Newark-Calgary connection. United further confirmed that the reason for the earlier delay was boarding of the aircraft taking longer than expected, which is within the airline's control. Due to the delay, United asked us to either re-book on a different United flight or get a refund.We spent over 2.5 hours on the phone with United trying to find an alternative flight, but were told that the earliest available alternative was not for another 2 days, even though we showed great flexibility e.g. we were willing to connect via a different city, split our family up so we flew on different airplanes, and / or accept a longer connection time. Despite this, United said there was absolutely no option for us to fly for another 2 days.We looked ourselves into flying with another airline, but the cost of such last-minute tickets was thousands of dollars per passenger and therefore prohibitively expensive. This meant cancelling our United flights and getting a refund was not a feasible solution. We note that United did NOT offer us the option of arranging a flight with a different airline carrier without additional expense, which is contrary to our rights under Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We therefore accepted the new United itinerary.We were shocked that a leading international airline like United was not able to reschedule us for two full days. Our family includes two elderly people and a 4 month old infant travelling long distance for the first time in his young life. My wife has debilitating back and gastrointestinal issues and was forced to suffer a further two nights in a foreign country and hotel, rather than having the comforts of her own home and medical care. Our destination city of Calgary is not a small town - it has a population of 1.45 million people and a very active international airport. We were stuck in Boston during the very busy Boston Marathon weekend, which forced us to stay at an expensive hotel 2 more nights than we planned as we could not find last minute accommodation elsewhere (as you can imagine, it is even more difficult to find a hotel room that works for an infant and an elderly person with back problems). We also incurred additional meal costs and transportation costs to the airport.Our total additional expenses amounted to USD 1,110.We filed a formal complaint with United and requested compensation for this under the APPR legislation. It took United close to 2 months to reply, and they refused to provide any compensation whatsoever (vaguely blaming the weather, which was the first time we heard this excuse!), which is in violation of the APPR. We are now filing a formal legal complaint with the Canadian Transportation Agency but also wanted to write a review to make the public aware. All airlines have their issues, but this is a new low given our vulnerability",2023-01-05
"My entire family decided to go to Florida this coming May 2023. I booked this flight in September 2022 for myself only, I am not going the whole entire time that everyone else is. I have 2 dogs that I have never been separated from and I have anxiety about them. My friend was going to stay at my house and now due to her husband's medical condition has to cancel on me. When I booked this flight, I spelled my entire name out for the agent, I also asked her if this was refundable (just because of any emergency that I might have to cancel the trip, little did I know at the time this would actually happen) and she said yes it is refundable. I get my confirmation of the ticket in my email and my first name and last name has errors in it. I know from experience working on the phone that a lot of letters sound the same so that is why i always spell out my full name. So I go on the computer on their website and ""chat"" with a live representative.  She claimed she fixed it, I asked her to resend the confirmation, she would not.  I asked her when i get to the airport will I have a problem with the paper copy and email that I have with the wrong name on it. She told me no it is corrected.  so time goes by until this month, January 2023. I find out my friend isn't able to come up, I am in a panic. I call the customer service again to cancel the ticket.  I am told that it is a non refundable ticket. Then when he was asking me to confirm my name and I was spelling it for him, he said it was wrong. I saw red. I told him everything that had happened, he kept apologizing that she told me it was refundable and about my name. He told me that he will fix my name but it is another additional $99 charge to do this. I said this isn't my fault I spelled my name for her letter by letter using a name to clarify it, like D for dog. I should have never gotten it fixed but I went ahead and did it.  Well I am looking for boarding for my dogs and I am disgusted with what I am finding. so I call back 2 or 3 days later and talk to another agent. I again asked if I could get a refund and he said unfortunately no.  I asked if i could upgrade my seat to a refundable one for another $100, and again he said unfortunately I cannot. then I told him the story about the name change and I feel that I should not have been charged that $99 for the change since I did not enter my name into the computer, I spelled it out for that agent. He totally agreed and told me he was going to send an email to his superior, he could see who took the initial call. he also said he was going to carbon copy me on the email.  I am still waiting for that email to come through to me. I guess that was never done either, because I haven't heard a word from United from anyone. all of this was even before I even had a chance to stop foot on the plane. I have decided that I probably am not going to go on this trip, I am waiting for a call back from one more kennel and I don't have high hopes about that one either. So they won't refund my money because of an incompetent agent who you could barely understand to begin with. So I guess they expect me to eat the $500 loss. if I could rate United airlines lower than a 1 star, I would definitely be doing that. I am also going to leave this review in as many places as I possibly can. I am going to call again but I don't have any high hopes of getting any satisfaction. Very disgusted, I have flown UA in the past, many years ago and never had any problems. *** note: this trip did not even happen yet but the block of date of experience will not let me put a future date in it, I haven't even stepped foot on a plane and all of this has happened to me already.",2023-01-07
"Absolutes shambles. Flew out 10th Dec to Newark, airport process on the way to Newark fine, got on the plane hour delay in setting off- fine we can cope with this. 15th Dec to fly home, on the plane for over 2hours, they decide to announce ""mechanical fault"", we will fix it on the plane they said, then they tell us to deplane, then announce the flight is cancelled ""if you could all quickly make your way to alternative gate we have found a back up flight"" - ABSOLUTE OUTRIGHT LIE. 3 hours we wait at this gate, (having already been in the airport over 10 hours might i add). Customer service assistants whispering amongst themselves, telling us lies ""oh its just being cleaned at a different terminal then will make its way to us"" - again LIE. We then had to hear from another angry customer ""your flight has been cancelled"", they didnt even bother to tell us ourselves. 50% of the approx 250 of us received a text to rebook flights and have hotel for night - we were not one of these lucky recipients. we tried united airlines customer service - USELESS. phoned TUI emergency helpline who we booked with ""its unite airlines responsibility we dont have back up aeroplanes"", BRILLIANT. after several hours of being sat at the infamous gate with the infamous plane, we managed to speak with a united airlines representative, she couldnt understand why our text had not been sent, however managed to get us into a hotel in New Jersey- yet another 45 minutes of travelling. We rebooked our flights for 10pm - (bare in mind this was already 4am). *Also to add, a mother and daughter we met at the airport, were not even allocated a hotel, they were provided with x2 sun loungers in the middle of Newark airport to sleep for over 18 hours- i cannot even begin to imagine how they felt. This is an example of anothers experience. Spoke to customer service online, and back in Newark airport next day (having to pay for our own transfer back to the airport which is 60 dollars) - added ourselves to standby flights for 1845pm and 2015pm, managed to up to 9pm flight as confirmed. asked what would happen to our luggage should we manage to board a standby ""oh dont worry it is coded to board the specific flight your on"". no contact that we had been allocated a seat for 2015pm flight, we board our flight - 1 hour delayed, and the plane returns to gate so someones luggage can be taken off - SHAMBLES. we arrive in Heathrow after 37 hours travelling, OUR LUGGAGE IS IN NEWARK. what a surprise. we fill out incident form with their representatives, apparently its our fault for not boarding the right flight- anyone to blame but themselves. It is what it is, we just want our luggage not an argument with another incompetent worker. its now 18/12/22, we should have been home 16/12/22 friday lunchtime, we got home 17/12/22 5pm with no luggage. We have spent the last 12 hours trying to find our luggage and trying to get through to a real person at united airlines. The quest continues as of 18/12/22 1359hrs, still no luggage, still no real person to speak to. update 20/12/22 still no luggage, spent over 3.5 hours on live chat and phone calls last night, 1 advisor told us our luggage was out for delivery in UK, another told us the luggage was still in Newark and another told us it was in Heathrow???? USLESS. Was told to call Groundcare Solutions. Groundcare solutions is not a company it went bust, Eagle Aviation is now the luggage company, we were told our luggage would be delivered 20/12/22, it hasnt. Now been told 22/12/22, that will make it a total of 6 days late.  Moral of this long review story is- AVOID THIS AIRLINE AT ANY COST. We booked our package through TUI, so they are due a swift complaint and some stern advice not to associate themselves with such a shambolic airline. PLEASE AVOID FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY. If we could give -5 stars we would.",2023-01-07
"Thanks to United Airlines for taking the time to make our trip into a nightmare. I hope that this review will help you avoid the insane level of anxiety this experience has caused.I previously had a good experience with Lufthansa Airlines and chose to book a trip with them again, or so I thought. The flight was advertised as Lufthansa, but in reality, it was a Lufthansa flight “operated by United Airlines.” I had not used them before but figured they should be good as they were chosen as a partner with my preferred airline—mistake number one.At the airport, there were only kiosks to check in. I flagged down an employee—a rude woman ordered us to produce the credit card we used to pay for the trip. She took the card, shoved it into the machine, pointed at the screen as if we should have known that, then walked away.We boarded our first plane. The seats were cramped. The flight crew was pretty cold and uncaring, bordering on rude. The inflight service was a small cup of generic, flat soda or juice that tasted like wastewater. But thankfully, we had two families with screaming children and parents who were blissfully unaware that everyone on the flight hated them.The connecting flight was a nine-hour hellscape with the same screaming children, oblivious parents, but different yet still rude flight attendants. They had two meal options and ran out of one. They said we would have to wait until the business class passengers were served to see if anything was left, but “no promises.”When we reached the destination country, the third leg was on an actual Lufthansa plane, and the experience was like night and day. The staff was friendly and talkative, with a sense of humor. It was a good experience that we were expecting.For the return flights, each United plane was delayed for various reasons. When we tried to find our gate (not marked on the boarding pass), the staff told us to go upstairs. When asked which way, we were sarcastically told, “It doesn’t matter.” We luckily found an airport police officer who guided us in the right direction. We reached the connecting plane and were among the last three or four people to board. When we opened the compartment above our seats, the flight attendant screamed, “If the lid is closed, it is full!” No offer of help at all.They closed the doors, and ten mins later, the Captain announced that the plane (that we were on) arrived with mechanical problems, and they could not fix them, so everyone would have to deplane and move to another gate about a half-mile away. No one was pleased. We arrived and had to wait for the flight crew to show up and pretend nothing was wrong.Arriving at our final destination (home), we were directed to where to pick up our luggage. We discovered they did not forward the bags because apparently *WE* did not tell them to (despite having connecting flights). Our luggage was still halfway across the country. We gave them our info, and they said they would track them and deliver them the next day.The next day only 1 bag is delivered. No one has a clue there are supposed to be 2, despite us providing both tracking numbers on the receipt they gave us. I called, and after a 45 min hold, I was told the second bag was not forwarded because *we* did not tell them to forward it with the first one. The person on the phone said they would look into it and said the DELIVERY company would call me. The delivery person calls and says they were only given one bag and knew nothing about the other. I call again, and another person said that the second bag was in the other airport because, again, *we* did not have it forwarded. After some intense conversation, he says he will request it to be shipped and delivered. The next day comes and goes, and no bag. I called back (another long hold session) and found that it was NOT forwarded because (you guessed it) *we* did not request it to be forwarded. Fast forward to three days later, I have *FINALLY* received the bag. The delivery company was kind and understanding, but not a peep from the damn airline that caused this misery.This experience has been, without a doubt, the worst experience with any airline. This was our FIRST experience with United Airlines and our LAST one. Do yourself a favor. Avoid United Airlines at all costs. You will thank me.",2023-01-05
