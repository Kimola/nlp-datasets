"Prior to coming to Green Lake Jewelry Works I had been wearing my custom-designed engagement/wedding ring for 19 years (made by another jeweler). That ring never really suited me.

"Greenlake Jewelry is committed to their craft. I wanted to custom ring to represent our adventures in the PNW. The design process was initially great. The designer seemed inspired by my story and what the ring meant and did a good job visualizing what I was hoping for in a sketch. But, the designer had a vacation planned and handed the project off to a colleague to see it through. I struggled to get the second designer on the same page, and just wasn't inspired by the CAD or wax designs. Though I wasn't really liking what I was seeing, I was assured the final result would be what I wanted. I grew very frustrated and asked to just cancel the project. Greenlake did everything they could to not only keep my business but ensure I walked away happy. One of the founders took control of the project and made some creative changes to the design that resulted in a very unique and beautiful ring that captured exactly what I was after. My partner cannot stop looking at it. She loves it.  I can't fault a company for supporting time off for its employees, and I can totally understand that my second designer felt swamped and could not give the kind of attention to the design that he normally would. All of this is understandable. Mistakes are inevitable. But given Greenlake's ownership of these mistakes then efforts to go beyond my expectations, I can confidently say this is a trustworthy jeweler which does quality work.",https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6565484844aff5f6ab7fd5d8,2023-11-28T03:54:16.0000000Z,,Positive,Positive Experience Overall

I use Green Lake for their integrity, knowledge,reasonable pricing, and incredible range of talented artisans.

Honest businesses in jewelry are rare and fading and Green Lake is a beacon that keeps dying art alive. Sophia is an absolute pleasure to design with.

"Green Lake Jewelry Works (GLJW) is a fantastic company to work with in designing any custom jewelry! My fiance absolutely loved her engagement ring done by them. Their artists are wonderful, responsive, and very helpful throughout the process. It helps that they have an online portal set up that makes it very easy to communicate quickly and frequently with the artist you choose. And that's another thing- you can look through their extensive list of talented artists and each artist's portfolio and then select whomever you want to work with! They are very upfront about things like timeline, price, etc. They can also work with you depending on you own unique budget while still maintaining the high quality of the jewelry, so don't be afraid to reach out to them and ask within your own budget. Your opinions on the jewelry are seriously taken into account and they're very open to feedback and responsive on making quick alterations. HIGHLY recommend going to GLJW for all things custom jewelry!",https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/621655caba48cd57a2a0be48,2022-02-23T15:42:02.0000000Z,,Positive,Excellent Customer Service
"The designer Chelsea K was absolutely amazing in every way.  The custom ring was perfection.  Her communication was fantastic.  We did have a package lost in delivery and they shipped out a presentation ring to ensure the engagement plans would not be ruined. The package was found and their prompt shipping was great.  My only low point was dealing with Krista the production manager.  She had a lack of compassion when the ring was lost and said ""we should grow up, life is full of disappointments"".  She also went on to tell me that life does not go the way you want and shared that her baby was born prematurely and it is what it is....That was terrible but overall the company, the designer and the custom ring was five stars.  I would use this company again.",https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/636d0cacb84cc27618e7f12c,2022-11-10T16:37:33.0000000Z,,Negative,Positive Experience Overall

"Working with Green Lake Jewelry was by far the best experience I have ever had working with a jeweler - and possibly the best experience I've had with any store. We were intimately involved in the design process of our engagement ring from the beginning. Our designer's communication skills and customer service were above and beyond. Living in Oregon, I was a little nervous that we would feel disconnected from the design process, but Ben did an amazing job posting updates, images, videos, and questions to our shared blog page.

"Inherited a small amount of jewelry that I knew I would never wear because of style so decided to try and repurpose it.  Could not have been happier with the entire process from my initial walk into the store to the day, a few months later, I wore my very special custom jewelry home!  Brooke (designer) is an excellent listener and translated my preferences perfectly to the jeweler (Marc) who together created a stunning pair of earrings for me.  It's a beautiful store, the people are super friendly and welcoming, the team of craftspeople are working right there at stations you can see, and the whole experience was so enjoyable.

"What an amazing experience working with Ellen and the entire Green Lake Jewelry team.  It all started with a simple concept of a beautiful halo engagement ring, show casing a gorgeous diamond sitting on top of a beautiful infinity symbol to bring the entire ring together based on our forever love for one another.  From Ellen’s first sketches, to the 3D CAD drawings, to the wax moldings, casting, and finish product, I could see the entire ring come to life.  The guidance and communication was terrific and made the entire custom design process a lot of fun and stress free.  The weekly app updates through the process eased my stress about the final product. The team did a great job hitting the timeline (approx. 2 months) so I could pull off my proposal in Maui during our vacation.  I couldn’t be happier with the overall quality and beauty of the final custom engagement ring.

"I went to Sophia to design my custom engagement ring using an heirloom diamond. She did a FANTASTIC job. I went in with some somewhat squishy ideas of what I wanted. I showed her some inspo pics, telling her what I liked and disliked about each ring. She pulled a few rings out of the back that were hitting my vibe so I could try them on and see some aspects in real life. We again discussed what I liked and disliked about these rings. She then took about 10 minutes in the back to draw a sketch, which was PERFECT. From that sketch to the wax model to the final product, I didn't change a single thing (though I could have if anything wasn't to my liking). She then designed a simple pave wedding band to go with it.The only negative about the whole thing is the shop was swamped with work (good for them) so it took about three months to get the rings (one month to get the wax model and then another two to get the final product). Worth the wait for the perfect ring set though.",https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62a1a9950031539b613a5b45,2022-06-09T10:04:37.0000000Z,,Positive,Custom Design Process

"I couldn't recommend Green Lake Jewelry enough. I came here with a very custom idea and I couldn't be happier with both the result of the ring, both in quality and in perfecting the look I had imagined in my head.My designer Brooke was beyond words amazing. I came to her with an idea and a water bottle filled with Herkimer diamonds me and my gf found together. She helped me further envision the ring that would be perfect for my gf. We decided with Montana sapphires and Brooke was patient enough to wait for me to mine my own and bring back the rough sapphires for their amazing gemstone buyer Brant to take a look at.Brant was a huge part of the success of what brought this project together. Ya know when you meet somebody and they love and breathe their craft? Yeah that's Brant when it comes to gemstones. I was beyond happy to have gotten his help in this project and it just reflects more of the quality Green Lake Jewelry invests into its business by employing only the most skilled people like their gemstone buyer Brant.Watching the ring come together from the 3-D autocad and the wax mold. All the way to casting and progress pictures of setting and gold work. The process of taking raw metal and some stone from such a rough shape to something so beautiful is a skill beyond words.Their Jeweler Marc is beyond words. The detail and quality he puts into his work is apparent in every curve and bend in this ring. The thought and intelligence he puts into his craft is something you won't find in many people. He crafted the leaves of the vine wrapping up the ring to hold in the Herkimer diamonds in such a way that if I need to replace the stones in the future I can. The kindness this man has radiates from him and I couldn't thank him enough for his work on this ring.To all at Green Lake Jewelry thank you so so much.

"In 2015, my fiancé and I went to GLJ by Northgate to have wedding bands made from a basic design I saw years ago, but I had modifications in mind to make them unique. We met Ben Merchant, our design guy. He was so great to work with and so helpful. Fast forward to 2021... I looked into having the ring remade, as I had lost weight after retiring and the design didn't allow a simple resizing. It turned out that Ben had moved to the Bellevue store, so I drove way out of the way just to have Ben in charge of the new ring. I had a minor design adjustment in mind, so Ben had drawings of all the possible options. Design is very organic, one option sparks a new idea. When it came to the very last detail of possibly adding diamonds, Ben sent the drawing I asked for. I was disappointed to see my idea kinda flopped, but Ben had included drawings of different shaped diamonds and WOW! The square cut (princess) jumped right off the screen and slapped me in the face. I love design that is Simple, Bold and Elegant. The original ring fit this equation, but Ben's vision made this truly equal thirds. And he made sure it was done in time for the holiday get-togethers. Well worth the extra drive. And the ring looks beautiful!

The designer I worked with, Christine D, helped me bring it to life with creative suggestions, expert knowledge, and willingness to answer all my questions.I came in feeling like a novice, but we landed on a spectacular design and priced out the ring in no time. From there, Christine kept me updated on every stage of the process, which was so great for my peace of mind – especially because all of this was happening during a cross-country move (on that note, I should add that Green Lake Jewelry can handle the entire process remotely, and it's like you're right there in the studio).I had a feeling my girlfriend (now fiancée 🙂) would be excited about the design, but nothing could have really prepared me for her reaction.

He also pointed out and helped us navigate considerations we did not anticipate, such as benefits and/or drawbacks of certain metals based on each of our styles and preferences. And, importantly, the engagement ring and wedding bands were each completed as designed and on schedule.Since all of this happened during the pandemic, we also wanted to emphasize that we felt confident scheduling appointments to visit the store.

"Working with Sophia was great, but the piece was too light (not enough gold) given the price paid. At a minimum, she should have offered up a heavier version at the price of gold since most of the cost went into the custom design.To be more succinct (clear), if the price of gold was $2000 and the piece weighed 7 grams, and the price of the pendant was $1600, we can conclude the gold component reflected 25% of the cost. So, taking that math one step further, had the piece been made to weigh out at 14 grams, then the additional material cost would have been another $400. In hindsight, I would have gladly paid the additional $400, but was never given the option.C'est la vie. My daughter loved it, I just wish it had a bit more sustenance to it.UPDATE - Jan 22, 2021: Amazing service, I changed my rating to 5 stars and would have given 10 if that option was an option. Following my original post, Sophia reached out and offered to address the weight issue - at no charge! We accepted and a month later our re-tooled pendant arrived.

"I decided to upgrade my wedding ring setting and after visiting many jewelry stores, Green Lake Jewelry had the best selection. From the moment I stepped into the store, the customer service was impeccable. Greeted with a smile (smiling eyes since we were all wearing masks) and a feeling of welcome. Very knowledgeable staff that heard every aspect of my ring design. They have a website that I could communicate with my ring designer which is helpful for the progress of my ring. The turn around time was 10 weeks for a beautiful setting plus a shadow ring. It was a long process but the finished product is worth it. I just love my new ring. My only critique is with their email communication. It could be improved by a more timely response, but otherwise, calling the store with updates worked well too. If my designer was off that day, the other staff were helpful in my ring’s progress. In addition, they are also concerned about the care and status of my ring. I can drop by anytime for a ring cleaning and I have a schedule to stop by every 6 months to check the setting. I highly recommend Green Lake Jewelry and I would use them again in a heartbeat.",https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5fd89cf4755dc107e0c3a2d9,2020-12-15T11:27:12.0000000Z,,Positive,None
"I've worked with Green Lake Jewelry since they made our engagement and wedding rings back in 2001. Since then, I've come to them to design creative, original pieces with both gems that I brought to them and gems that they've obtained. It's always a wonderful experience. For their latest creation, they took a pair of my birthstones to craft a one-of-a-kind hinged pendant. So wonderful! I'll see them again for another piece, no doubt.

Your designer Ashley worked with my wife and I to help pick out a fabulous diamond for her engagement ring. She helped narrow down our criteria for the caliber and shape of diamond we wanted to purchase and showed us a number of stones.

"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Green Lake and the team.  They are professional, personable, and beyond talented. I’ve never had such a great experience; I’m still beaming fromEar to ear! I live on the east coast and found Green Lake randomly in a google search. I reached out regarding my wedding band - married was than 2 years a d it was causing me to get a severe rash around my finger and hand (it was platinum) to the point where I couldn’t even wear it and it took my hand several weeks to heal. I cannot tell you what an awesome and amazing experience I had with them. After several initial discussions with them on what was going on, what I wanted (remake the setting using my stones), sent them pics of my band and my engagement trying - they came back with proposals.  Rebecca was my consultant and designer, she is beyond amazing! She took the time to explain their processes, give me understand on what could be causing my issues and was wonderfully pleasant to speak with. They sent me a band to test for a few weeks before we moved forward. Once confirmed I had no issues, I sent them my actual band after and they called me saying that they had 3 people examine my band to confirm it was platinum and they wanted to triple check I really wanted to remake it - how many companies would do that?!  They also offered to do a professional deep clean and send it back to see if I still had issues before moving forward.  Once we decided to move forward,Rebecca kept me in constant contact in where they were with the process - confirming details of what I liked/ddi t like/maybe wanted to change with my band. She sent me CAD designs, after I approved they made a wax mould and sent it to me to approve and sent me ring sizers to confirm my ring size. They used the existing stones from my original bands, recycled my old band (credited against the total), and it took them about 4 weeks to do it. Everyone he commented how beautiful mom new band looks - it’s slimmer, less chunkier, and the detail they put in to make the stones prominent over the metal is wonderful. Again, they are an incredible team that if I’m in the position again to have some created, they will be whom I contact.",https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5fc26a975e693f08f00d2321,2020-11-28T15:19:51.0000000Z,,Positive,Positive Experience Overall

"I worked with Greenlake over the last few months to get a custom engagement ring made. Overall I would say it went excellently. Some major pros:-Great communication (pretty much constant) using their site-Very educational, they took extra effort to work with me and my partner to teach us about diamonds, rings, styles, restrictions etc. -Collaborative on the custom ring design went very well. They found a way to work with me in a way that made me feel like I was driving design decisions while they made sure the end result was beautiful-iterative. They didn't move forward to next steps in the process till I was comfortable and understood what would happen nextMost importantly the final result was phenomenally beautiful.

"I came to Green Lake Jewelry feeling pretty frustrated and hopeless. I had been married for two years already with an engagement ring I ADORED but a wedding band that had never felt quite right. After the wedding band lost a diamond and I started getting a run around from the company that the ""lifetime"" warranty might not cover that, it was the last straw. I embarked on a quest to find the proper wedding band of my dreams that I loved as much as my engagement ring! I tried SO MANY jewelry stores and came empty time after time. Every time I walked in and said ""nature inspired"" the poor sales associates would sort of scratch their heads and offer me the best they had. So I was feeling pretty discouraged when I came into Green Lake Jewelry and gave the same spiel to Rebecca. And she blew me away right away!! Immediately after seeing my engagement ring she began drawing sketches for me and showing me possible wedding ring shapes that would fulfill my desires: could be worn separately but also add some va va voom with my engagement ring.After sending her some inspiration pictures from the closest wedding ring option I found previously so generated a model that I instantly fell in love wiht. It's like she looked into my brain and knew exactly what I wanted!! Then came the wax viewing and finally the real deal and oh my god I can't sing enough praises. i LOVE my set now, and it brings me so much joy to see them together. Plus I can wear just my wedding band and it actually looks naturey without the engagement ring!! It was hard to live without my engagement ring for 5-6 weeks but it was so worth it!! And while the price was at the edge of our budget, the final result was worth every penny! You can tell an incredibly talented team of artists and jewelers worked to make my dream a reality, and can you really put a price tag on that? Don't wait, just go to Green Lake Jewelry if you ever want a custom piece and let them blow you away!",https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f98ae095e693f06f87346ed,2020-10-27T23:32:25.0000000Z,,Negative,Custom Wedding Bands

"Green Lake already had a track record of designing beautiful rings that perfectly fit our friends, so when it came time to design one for for my partner they were already in my top three. Weighing their depth of experience, long history of beautiful rings, large pool of talented designers, and easy to use design pages choosing Green Lake was a no-brainer.From start to finish Green Lake's professional designers work with you to understand where you're at and what your vision for your ring is. I was fortunate to have Ashley Y as the designer for our ring as she helped take the stress out of making such big decisions. Each step of the way she helped me focus in on the next step of the process and made sure I had a good understanding of what it was I was deciding on. Before I knew it Ashley had three gorgeous designs ready and knowing our ring was right there in front of me we were on to production. Only a handful of weeks after we started, I had our ring in hand and one decision left to make: how do I propose?Now that we're engaged, we have Green Lake and especially Ashley to thank for making it both easy and extra special.

We worked with Ben in the Bellevue studio and he was fantastic, although I am sure all designers are great.

He met with us to figure out which center stone would work best for us based on our budget and placed the order for us. We got to come back in and see the stone in person once it arrived and try it on in the wax model.

"We had some friends that just used this store and had a great experience so we thought we'd try. We went in for an appointment which was great. We were walked through everything, some great options were laid out and we ended up going with the most simple ring possible with just a band and a 6 prong setting for the gem. We pay and get an estimate for the 12th, several weeks away. All is good. I call on the 10th and ask if the estimate is accurate and if we are on track for the 12th. They tell me yes and ask if I had plans for that weekend and I told them I had something in mind and needed to know if the ring would be done. They told me it was in setting and should absolutely be ready by that date and they'd call me. It's 5pm on the 12th and I call an hour before closing and ask if its ready and they say no. It won't be ready today, not even tomorrow, maybe not even the day after. Probably the 16th. They'd call me and let me know. I told them they confirmed the estimate which is why I called to check in the first place. The 16th comes and I don't get any contact. I call at 5 again. It's still not done and it's gonna be ""till the end of the week."" They say they'll call. Well the end of the week comes and it looks like third time's the charm and they got that estimate right, and I get a call to pick it up. The ring is great. We got what we paid for. The customer service was sub par, especially for something I'm paying thousands for. I get better service at my auto shop. I was never one contacted about any delays despite calling for a confirmation of estimate, and having it confirmed. They made me call them twice. That's not okay. I had a whole engagement planned for the 13th that I went through with because they assured me the ring would be done and I had to propose without it. I wouldn't do business here again. Great ring, bad service.

I was and probably still am a complete novice when it comes to jewelry, but Vinh made sure I had all the objective information (pros and cons, reason, cost, short & long-term effect, etc.) needed to make design decisions throughout the project. Most importantly, I did not feel any pressure to make decisions, which I am extremely appreciative of. I am confident that a good portion of the price went towards the customer service aspect of the project. He also responded to me through the design page within 48 hours though I would say his average response time was less than 8 hours. Every response he provided was thoughtful and direct. The design page overall was a great tool throughout the process, especially with COVID stuff.The end result was exactly how I had imagined it and more (though we have to do a slight resizing, which was on me).

She couldn’t see because I had a mask on but my jaw dropped when she opened the box. I could not be any happier with my ring, it is my absolute dream ring and I look forward to wearing it forever. It’s now an heirloom piece I look forward to passing on one day. Thank you Lena and Green Lake Jewelry for your patience, flawless execution, and beautiful craftsmanship.",https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f2aa52f1a5a6907a47b325e,2020-08-19T12:51:12.0000000Z,,Positive,Positive Experience Overall

She was patient and understanding, flexible with timing, and accommodating to our wishes to have the perfect center stone all while remaining mindful and respectful of our budget. She took our ideas and reviewed them with the craftsman who identified potential risks for initial design and came back with suggestions of other ideas to keep our vision but also ensure a safe and secure design.

"Sophia is an experienced jewelry designer at Greenlake Jewelry Works whose immense talent brought our concepts and visions to life.  Our wedding rings fuse design elements from Italian design, and the details of my ring are exquisite with lace-like patterns of intricate gold filigree weave.  My fiancé's ring is more contemporary yet mirrors design elements which complement the other.  Both of us were amazed how she listens attentively to a concept then delivers the design with precision.  These beautiful original works of art, most importantly, will celebrate our union and our love. After the rings were completed, my partner hired Sophia to make a pair of Italian style gold earrings that would compliment my ring and rekindle a distinctive memory from early childhood.  An Italian family who lived next door to us encouraged me to get my ears pierced.  So Antonio, my girlfriend's father pierced my ears when I was just four years old.  On that special day, I remember walking down the stairs with gold filigree Italian earrings feeling like a princess.  With a photo and a good jewelry designer, Sophia recreated my Italian earrings going beyond my dreams.  She was able to recapture a childhood memory that I will treasure forever.
