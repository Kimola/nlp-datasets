"Absolutely love our new tags! So far the quality is great.  We haven't quite put them to the test with our typical outdoor adventures that have destroyed other tags, but I'm fairly confident they will pass with flying colors. The added glow in the dark ring around them has been wonderful. Love that I can update both my pups information in the same place/account as well for that ""just in case"" situation.My only negative experience (and reason for 4 stars) was with any kind of customer service.  After receiving the purchase confirmation email, I never received another one.  I kept trying to check my order online through my account but it never showed any updates or tracking number and I emailed twice inquiring the status and never received any kind of response.  It just showed up in my mailbox one day, which I'm grateful for, but it would have been nice to have some kind of update and/or response to emails.All in all super stoked about our new tags!";https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/651d9786149b5624ae3938ff;2023-10-04T18:49:10.0000000Z;Positive;Quality and Durability

"Fine experience again that time; received both items quickly. Only disappointing order was earlier this year, when a tag attachment piece began to shrivel and broke within months. That’s never happened before; those have always been great. Tried one more in a different color but now don’t need it anymore, so won’t know until it can be used in the future sometime. Only then would I be able to tell whether those particular ones would still be worth buying (I’d hope so as I love their color coordination factor, even if they’re overpriced.) General review of company would be: World's finest selection of artistic, top-quality tags, unquestioned--allowing every pet to sport perfectly personalized neck-bling for style and safety. Have fun looking through the troves of designs to find precisely the proper one, then finish off with the just-right choice of attachment (plus a protective rubber silencer if you so choose.) Always a good time and comes printed beautifully on both sides.

I don’t give out 5 stars often but these are seriously the best tags I have ever found!  Engraved tags wear down-even the best ones on the market.  These just don’t.  I have had 5 Australian Shepherds wearing these tags day after day-with other tags on their collars.  Other than  having been chewed (they have tooth marks!) and tugged on, you can still read them!

I ordered one for my 15 year old cat when he was a kitten and it is still, after 15 years, in excellent condition.If your cat / dog is a chewer, make sure the tag is close enough to their collar so they can't get to it to chew on it.

"I have used Dog Tag Art for many, many years, and have always been impressed with their high-quality work. I changed my opinion when I received my last tags in the mail. True, they are still high quality in the toughness of the material, but I was appalled at the lack of ability to read ""Do Not Separate From Handler"" on my dog's service dog tag. I know this because I had the same tag on my last service dog 10 years ago and it looks better than the one I just received. I'm not sure why this company chose to alter the perfect lettering they had previously. But hopefully they will review this issue and rectify this issue. I did have photos showing the old tag and the new to help the shopper, but this review does not have the capability to post photos. I have contacted the company and they will not respond. Hope this helps everyone! UPDATE: The company did contact me after this review and I received excellent customer service, they replaced the tags and explained to me that there was a change the machines used and font styles. The lady I spoke to on the phone was professional, friendly and represented the company fabulously. I did receive the replacement tags, were they as good as the originals?

This is a high quality, durable dog tag! My dog has been wearing it for a few months now and it doesn’t have a scratch and we go to the beach weekly. This is the Small size which is perfect for my Chihuahua + Mini Pinscher mix. I expected it to have a shiny finish but it actually has more of a matte finish, but I still like it just fine. The printed image is high quality too. The ring to attach it to his collar was really hard to bend so I had to get a man with stronger hands to attach it for me. But at least I know it won’t fall off!;https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/61bd89930430e828ebd6cbc7;2021-12-18T07:11:15.0000000Z;Positive;Tag Design and Artwork

This is the first truly readable dog tag I've ever purchased--now, if my dog is lost, somebody can actually read my phone number without undue effort. I'm very happy about that. I also liked the short time from order to delivery and the art on the back. To me, though, the function of a dog tag is to facilitate the dog's return, in the unlikely event that we become separated. This tag does that better than any tag I've purchased in the last 40 years.;https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62fbc416142fce1f45fbd058;2022-08-16T18:21:42.0000000Z;Positive;Quality and Durability

This medic dog tag is perfect for our epileptic Chesapeake Bay Retriever. It’s a great size and looks like it’s very durable and I like that it’s not as noisy as a metal only tag.

We watched the building be transformed from a drab tan to an exciting mural of a dog with a stick and the mountain vista. It looks great! We weren't sure what the building was but when we found out it was Dog Tag Art, we immediately ordered a new one for our little fur baby. We love it. There are a lot of design options.

Years ago, I created and ordered a tag to identify my dog if lost.  It had a picture of her and me on front and on back it had my contact info.  She was my trusted and loyal companion for over 14 years.  When she passed, I left her tag on her to always identify her as mine.  So, I went back to Dog Tag Art and found that my tag was still on file.  With the help of Holly Matthews, I was able to change the contact info to our names and Cayenne's dates and order a new tag, which I now wear around my neck.  Holly did such a wonderful job helping me.  She was courteous, kind and professional.  Their tags lasted 14 years on Cayenne and now I wear one.  I will order from them again!;https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6425c88b746ca7dfeaffb6ad;2023-03-31T05:57:35.0000000Z;Positive;Customization and Personalization
