I the went to the website and tried to sign up and discovered there’s no way to do it. 

Using their chat bots for support to try to find a way to sign up lead to the chat bot crashing with several errors repeatedly. 

There is no way to sign up for a full plan, even sadder everything that I had input into the application is now unavailable because the trial is over. There’s no number for customer support and no way to actually complete the transaction.

Is the drop off of functionality from the desktop app to the iPhone and iPad app.  Functionality drops off the cliff and it’s very clunky.

I’ve grown used to the desktop app and browser version and I find myself using my laptop as much as I can instead of the app.  The iOS and iPad apps I use only if I have to.  With Trello, I would use them all interchangeably without issue.  On my iPad, you can’t use Chrome but you can use Safari, that may be my solution in place of the app, which feels like a miss."

Maybe try Monday or a different service that actually cares about its customers."

It’s unreliable.  Glitches constantly.  Randomly fails to update from changes made on mobile devices.  Now all my thumbnails just randomly stopped showing.  Definitely not worth the price and costs us thousands in lost time, lost info, confusion, etc.  

Truly great concept but the app is just not reliable."
2024-09-16,-,"The issue with Asana is that while it allows task creation, it doesn't provide a time-based view for tasks within a day. For example, you can't schedule a task to be completed from 9 to 10 AM, as Asana's calendar view doesn't show hourly breakdowns. This makes time blocking difficult. Additionally, when you import Asana tasks into Outlook or Google Calendar, it blocks the entire day, even if it’s one task, because Asana doesn't support time-specific task scheduling."

For example , I do not want constant emails for everything that happens but cannot turn off emails.     Also I need to constantly rearrange the tasks as my priorities are very dynamic and that necessitates more time to change due dates and/assignee, hence I’d like to disable the due date or assignee but cannot.    Also, after wasting a lot of time trying to solve certain things I FINALLY got to a real person but he offered me no solution."
2024-08-28,-,"First, they force you to download their app if you try to login through your phone (I’m against downloading apps unless it’s needed/helpful to me).  Then, they don’t give you an option to turn off email notifications from within the app so you have to find a computer to login and do so.  In the end, I have to go through a computer to have all features accessible so it was pointless to download the app at all."

2024-08-10,-,Been using Asana for a few years. Suddenly I tried to open it on my iPhone today and they told me I had to update the app. The update it said it wouldn't install unless I upgraded my operating system. I'm on the highest version of the  operating system that my phone allows. So it's buy a new phone or stop using Asana. asana will force you into a phone upgrade treadmill.
2024-08-06,-,"We purchased Asana on a per license basis for our small business. We put in considerable effort to design our processes around Asana. Overnight the licensing structure had changed so instead of per user, it’s now 1-5, and 6-10. Meaning for our sixth employee, we now need to pay double what we were paying for Asana. This kind of thing makes planning software costs for small businesses impossible. I suggest avoiding asana because they do not honor the licensing structure that you signed up with."

However, I’ve taken the time to explore this app well and so far I believe it’s beyond amazing!"

2024-07-15,-,"How is it possible that the desktop app is so well considered but the iOS iPadOS versions are best avoided?

Calendar view is not helpful at all. I don’t understand why it doesn’t display more like the desktop and show, I dunno, what your upcoming week will looks like. That’s just am example.

Why I say why does the app insist on showing you completed tasks always all the time. Can you disable that? I haven’t found out how.

Every time I open the iOS or iPadOS app I regret it, and yet the desktop app is constantly open and used when I work. It’s an essential part of my workflow."
2024-07-12,-,"Please, please, add the availability to create a “new section” within a task or subtask in the mobile app. It would also be appreciated if more colors were added to differentiate tags and projects. ✨"
2024-07-09,-,"I’ve relied on Asana for years to manage my personal and business tasks. After trying a lot of different project management and task apps, it offered the best capabilities and the amount of features available with the free version is impressive. I regularly use Asana in browser and the mobile app, and it’s always great with syncing changes between the two.

Two things that have always irritated me:
1. On the mobile app there’s no auto-save, so if you get distracted and forget to click save you can lose any updates you made to the task description.
2. They’ve never offered a paid plan for just one seat. You have to purchase a minimum of 2 users. I would gladly pay to upgrade if they ever decide to offer it for a single user.

Those are relatively minor annoyances considering how useful Asana is. However, over the past six months or so there have been a series of updates that don’t seem to add much useful functionality, and the app has been noticeably less stable. At times, it crashes almost every time I open it. It also has other bugs, like I can’t see the description of a task when I view it from search. I have to navigate to the project and then to the task in order to see the details. 

The recent updates have added a lot more white space to every aspect of the board view. Normally I like a clean, modern look but these updates make the app feel more clunky and disjointed. Asana, why are you ruining a good thing while feature requests that have been waiting for years continue to be ignored? If this continues, I will be looking into other solutions. But I’m hopeful this app can go back to being the streamlined and indispensable tool it once was!"
2024-07-04,-,My tasks keep disappearing immediately after I create them in My Tasks. There are no dependencies or rules set up. There’s no reason why this should be happening. So confusing.
2024-06-28,-,I use Asana as an accounting consultant. It’s amazing for keeping track of each client and the monthly tasks. And the My Tasks collates it all together making it easy to plan your day. I feel more organized and confident in knowing what tasks need to be completed and when. I also use it to track personal projects/chores as well.

All Tasks, My Tasks, Overdue Tasks, etc. Showing me 0 Tasks even though I have 50 overdue tasks is not helpful. 

Persistent Views 
Every time I go to My Tasks in the iOS app, my view settings have reset. It would be better if my view settings would persist, so that each time I return to My Tasks, it is configured just the way I like, with the filters I like, sort of the way I like, and only showing in complete tasks instead of all tasks. This makes for a more consistent and better user experience."

2024-05-17,-,"Great product but I need two things:
- save my sort and filter preferences for tasks. why does the app always pull up a random mix of tasks where I always have to resort them to find my most relevant tasks (by date and incomplete)

2024-05-14,-,"First, Asana is great and helps me organize my team. But why did I take my time and write a review? Because the devs were both clever and cool enough to take time to write up release notes that are both entertaining and informative. Nice

2024-05-11,-,"The inability to only see the kinds of widgets I want to see on the Home Screen is frustrating and makes other views more useful. There is also a lack of customization for the kinds of notifications you receive as well.

2024-05-10,-,This app would be great if we had the full time management features. It’s the main reason I use Asana so to not have access to it makes it impossible to use. I have to use it through the website so the app feels useless to me.
2024-05-05,-,The desktop version is great with some slight fixes still needed. But the app version is AWFUL. It’s so clunky and unintuitive. It’s unfortunate since it seems that using Asana on the go is valuable to project management.

2024-04-19,-,"Generally asana is ok. But their features are broken and often unintuitive, unlike how they started more than a decade ago. 

1. The mobile app is just constantly broken. Right now, you can’t move tasks up or down anymore. 
2. Switching “organisations”, ie from private to work, is much more complicated than it should be (it used to be 2 quick clicks, now it’s 4-5 that one can’t find). 
3. They never released a watch app, which is dumb for a todo app, that should be available everywhere. 

They’ve clearly lost their way. It’s feature overload these days. Trying usemotion instead now…"

2024-04-03,-,"The web version of Asana is amazing and handles my multitude of tasks. The app (hence the rating) is clumsily laid out with odd and terrible choices —

My Tasks has a compact mode, other boards do not?

Filters I set on the website do not automatically carry over? (The structures do — I can set them here — but it would be lovely if they auto-synced for a uniform experience)

In many ways the app and site experience feel completely divorced from each other.

99% of my work is via the site — I highly recommend Asana as a product — but the mobile app needs a careful restructure and redesign that is built in the mode of “hm I am using my phone, I need to scroll down the vast majority of time as that’s how phone apps work given the physical size.”

And/or — swipe left and right to open new modes on a task (complete, or the various stats, etc)

On a phone I am far, far more focused on a task than organizing mg workflow. On the site, the opposite!

IN SHORT: site great, product great, mobile feels needs significant design work.

2 stars because it does work albeit is mostly useless to my specific workflow."

2024-03-23,-,"I’m giving Asana 5 stars first and foremost because it’s so user friendly. It’s helped us to stay on the same page, while being on different parts of the globe. It’s as systematic and detailed, as those of us working on the same project, yet allows us to maintain privacy, when needed. It really helps us to maintain our reversebus vision and mission, and I’m just so pleased, and absolutely love this software."
2024-03-20,-,"I am shocked that this app has a 4.7 average rating. 
My entire days are structured around asana tasks, and I have the app open on my computer and phone for most of the day. The desktop version is amazing — no other task management software has the same capabilities or UX. However, the iOS app is seriously lacking:
1. “My tasks” view will not update task due dates or names unless you force quit the app. This means I have to force quit and reopen the app every time I check my tasks, in case due dates have changed
2. No offline mode
3. No weekly calendar view for tasks — only daily or monthly

I would give one star due to the first item listed above, but rated two stars because the app has a widget which is actually fantastic for the Home Screen."
2024-03-08,-,Asana wastes most of the screen. One is constantly working in the far lower right corner of the app. Lists of tasks are displayed with giant useless icons. Tree views are not available. If you use long task or project names they will be difficult to work with — usually displayed with truncation. It seems like many of their design choices were made with sales demos in mind; when you have to really work with the software the design that looked cool (seeing little face icons for everyone you know well) becomes tedious and time wasting.
2024-03-07,-,The problem is you can't turn off email notifications.

After different technical support employees giving me solutions that did not work they finally tell me that I am out of luck and I have lost my subscription. They cannot refund it or transfer it to another account that they can get to work. They then kindly told me to make sure you read the subscriber agreement.

2024-01-25,-,"I used Asana for 4 years, after trying to add a new user to a project I ran into trouble. This should be very straightforward, as Asana is, but it’s clear if you run into an issue you will not get the support you need. There is no 24/7 support, I’d get one question troubleshooting emails in the middle of the night and have to await the next day to get basically nowhere. After almost a week of no suggestions of how to fix this on my end, and also lack of clarity from support who spoke about the domains I have and how I should read the support articles on the website already yet there is nothing that comes up when you put in ‘domain’ on the support search (wtaf.)
I took the problem into my own hands and saw I had duplicate accounts for my personal email and one from my business email. So I deactivated one from my two personal, but guess what that did, it deactivated and deleted ALL of my accounts. This is irreversible, and completely unclear that this would be the case. 
Asana doesn’t realize this isn’t for fun, their services are used by lots of small businesses. Years of work and partnerships were deleted instantly. This was user error that made so through bad user experience, avoid this company, there’s so many others to choose from."

2023-12-08,-,The last update for this app was terrible. It looks and acts so clunky. Task lines are twice as tall as before which greatly reduced visibility of task lists. Reordering tasks has become very difficult as the app is not very responsive and it seems sections now cannot be reordered at all. This app seems to get less functional with every update. I can hardly use it now and may need to rethink how I use or or start using a new app all together. Bummer because the desktop version is pretty great. They just can’t figure out mobile.

2023-11-11,-,Why do tasks list default to sorting by “none”?
2023-10-30,-,Other apps like Jira have recently overhauled their user interface to make it better able to convey the most important information first and filter everything else with tons of space in between so that the amount of information is less overwhelming. I think Asana could do a lot to improve their notifications both in filtering and selecting when they want to be notified. I also think that Asana is somewhat confusing and in someways is almost too flexiblewhen setting up projects and working cross functionally because it requires almost what seems to be a collegiate degree to understand how the pieces fit together

2023-08-21,-,In general it works okay. My issue is that I work in broadcast and our shooting calendar is a saved search. On the app it sorts by completed tasks starting in 2020. So in order to see anything I’d have to scroll through literal years of completed tasks and I have no earthly idea why I would want that.
2023-08-19,-,"Trying to do some basic things like look up all tasks assigned to a worker and it’s impossible to find.  Not intuitive for sure.

When viewing a task and clicking the worker it takes you to a task assigned to someone else.  

One touch later you’re accidentally un assigning the worker without any warning or confirmation.  

Accidentally touch another spot and with ZERO WARNING you just completed someone elses task and didn’t even know it. 

It’s delayed when you click something so you’re don’t know the effect of your click until seconds later and you already clicking something else.

The search leaves little to be desired.

Its so frustrating, and to make it worse, Asana disabled the web version 100% so there is not even a backup method.  They’re forcing this crappy, horribly designed iOS version on all. 

In summary, I think this was designed for the unicorn user. I mean for the person who actually designed it.  I expect that persona to have small fingers, and know exactly where the mystery hotspots are.   

For me, I’m uninstalling this iOS version and looking for a better option.  

Our company has been using Asana since 2014.   Use the app and you get that nostalgic feeling of going back to that time."
2023-08-18,-,Great app but they make it difficult to figure out how to cancel the trial. I couldn’t from my phone so I emailed them and didn’t hear back after a few days. Then I had to use my laptop and still couldn’t find it. Went through their chat to get it cancelled (agent was nice). Even if I needed this app I wouldn’t support it. Cancelling a trial should be straight forward like other apps. It should be quick and easy and not take over 30 minutes to figure out. Could easily be interpreted as deceptive.

You can zoom in, but as soon as you update a task, it goes back to the small size.  No matter how well designed everything else might be, this is the main way I manage my tasks, so not being able to use the view renders the app essentially useless to me.  Customization of the display seems to be nonexistent so I can’t even get rid of an empty column that is taking up real estate in hopes of the text getting bigger.  I’d love to see the iPad app actually optimized to take advantage of the extra space.  And it’s possible there’s info about this in a forum somewhere but they seem to make you create an account to access that support.  So I’ll stick to using Asana on my Android phone where everything displays at a font size that is actually legible."
