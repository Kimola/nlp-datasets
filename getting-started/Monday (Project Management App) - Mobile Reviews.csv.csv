2025-03-16,-,"I have been waiting for months but have still yet to receive my w2 form through Monday.com. This has been an ongoing issue that many other companies that have used the platform have faced and yet it still hasn’t been solved. Do yourself a favor and use something else, it will save you time, stress, and money."
2025-03-15,-,Save your money on this waste of time.
2025-03-07,-,"Attempt to send a reply and the keyboard goes over the text box, not allowing you to see the text box. Hit send and it confirms it’s been sent but doesn’t send the response. Deleted and reinstalled the app, tried on iPad and had the exact same issue."
2025-03-06,-,"I went back to the App Store to make sure.  Nowhere I can find does it say this app is a subscription service or what you use is a free trial.  The email informing me I have a week left to choose a plan is not supported on a mobile device.  You have to use a desktop or laptop to sign up and while I like the app, I find the entire experience to be a bit deceptive, so, no, not signing up.  Deleting instead."
2025-03-06,-,Like it
2025-03-05,-,Notification seem to be broken and they break occasionally. The software is generally not helpful and is basically a glorified Excel spreadsheet. Also a very stupid name that makes projects confusing when talking about things that are due on Monday etc.
2025-03-04,-,"Monday is an awesome tool. Very intuitive and worth the investment in time or money to organize your life and/or your team! 

It’s refreshing to work with a system that updates in live time across devices (laptop to mobile app) and across accounts (my teammate to me)! It had us excited to get work done and celebrate what we’ve accomplished, where we’ve been and plan for what’s ahead. 

I highly recommend Monday.com for your team and project management!"
2025-02-28,-,"how come you can't login under Google instead of creating a new password and the same goes for inviting team members they can't login using their Google account either. They have to create new passwords. This just makes a mess now I've created a team and for some reason I can't log into that team after all the work I put in because it has a separate password, which I don't know"
2025-02-26,-,"We love this app in our office, the desktop and mobile apps are very friendly to use!"
2025-02-17,-,I have been trying for three hours to cancel my subscription.  The AI generated content on the Help function will not accept the contact form and times out for delivery.  This app is not operational on an HP and does not get the full menu on IPad.  I would not download this app unless you know you will be using it and are required to do so.  Only under duress…
2025-02-01,-,App needs update so functions work on mobile device
2025-01-31,-,Monday.com is an amazing app. It allows me to keep up in real time. Add pictures. Stay on task- following up with employees in an addition at allow upper management to login and see the progress.Thank You!
2025-01-30,-,"Seemed promising with a lot of great features but they won’t fix basic issues like not being able to add or change a column to a board, and not having the proper board owner permissions, making it basically useless. Support hasn’t answered any questions or help tickets about it."
2025-01-28,-,Can’t work on my page due to mandatory screen recording requirements. Poorly executed for such an expensive platform. When I pay this kind of money I want unlimited access. Very unfortunate.
2025-01-24,-,I have tried many project management softwares for personal use and work. I find many of them to be overly complicated and some to be too simple without enough capabilities / integrations. Monday really allows for a simple format that still includes all the bells and whistles.
2025-01-23,-,As an admin I need to be able to access the same features that are in the website. Currently it tells me that a certain feature is not supported and to use my browser. Then I use my browser on my phone and it tells me to download the app. Pointless.
2025-01-21,-,"I use monday on a full desktop browser, and everything works fine, but the iPad app can’t even open a single kanban card. Amazingly nonfunctional."
2025-01-19,-,It’s free ??
2025-01-10,-,It has worked well for tracking deals on land sites that we are working on buying for clients.
2025-01-10,-,"Monday allows our team to keep up with projects, proposals, deadlines and who is doing what! An excellent business tool."
2024-12-29,-,"This program great, but I have spent monies cuz, your database won’t let me delete users."
2024-12-27,-,"The app on iOS doesn't refresh after updates to items. I have to force close the app and reopen to see my changes in ""My Work"" view."
2024-12-17,-,"I love this app and it has really improved my daily productivity, but there are few frustrating things I’d love to see changed. 
-I archive items often to reduce clutter, but it would be really great to be able to set automations from the app to be able to automatically archive when marked “done”.
- I  almost exclusively use the app, and I have to archive items manually. Sometimes, when I archive multiple things at once I realize I need to restore an item and there is no way to do this without using the web version from a laptop which I don’t often have access to onsite. This is extremely frustrating.
-I’d like to be able to set different columns for items and sub items, individually for each different one. For instance, I use one item for inventory, and i only need a checkbox category for the sub items. I use another item for projects, and I need to be able to use status categories for those. When you edit the columns in one, the app automatically updates the columns in the other and I know I can have both status and checkboxes, but being able to customize individually would keep the columns less cluttered. 
-lastly, there’s no way to access my subscription from the app. This feels a bit predatory and it would be more transparent if there was full access to my profile from whatever device I’m using. 

All in all, I do really like the app- but these things need to be addressed."
2024-12-16,-,"Please make it easy to repeat different tasks again without automations and all this app stuff where they say you have 14 days until you need to pay for these wild plugins…. Simple and effective, for simple core tasks. :("
2024-12-14,-,The billing is very confusing and the addition and subtraction of team members is not easy to find to help control the billing costs.
2024-12-13,-,The app works well to update items on the go and track deadlines. I don’t build out new items and boards on mobile. Love that I can update Monday when I’m thinking of something no matter where I am.
2024-12-13,-,This app is amazing. I am a contractor and I can keep track of all my employees and keep everything in order. I also love how you can add the prices for certain jobs. I can go on forever. It’s awesome. Everything I’ve been looking for.
2024-12-11,-,This application is worthless garbage…. What is the point of an application that is so poorly designed
2024-11-28,-,Beautiful energy
2024-11-15,-,"Very fluent app. Only clunky thing is not being able to access subitems from the notification, my work areas on the app"
2024-11-13,-,"Believe me, the free trial is not. I’ve wasted more time deleting emails from these people that I have using the app.

Within one hour of downloading the app and starting my free trial, I had received several emails from them. At the end of the first week, I was nearly being email harassed by an account rep, trying to get me to sign up.

I literally had not gotten to the point of setting up a single task on the app before they were trying to get me to buy it for our entire organization."
2024-11-08,-,This platform is so far the best platform I’ve use for project management. I’m still learning how to use most of their features but so far I’m very pleased with what I know.
2024-11-07,-,Can’t even sign up
2024-11-05,-,"I work for an International NGO and Monday.com has helped change the way in which our global team interacts and collaborates.  From submitting invoices, basic CRM, Project Management and general accountability, Monday.com has been able to help us achieve greater efficiency and impact!  I love using Monday.com and we are always looking for better and more creative ways to use the platform.  Can’t wait to see what’s next!"
2024-10-20,-,Been trying for 30 minutes to add a collaborator to a board to no avail.
2024-10-09,-,"I’ve only used Monday for 2 weeks, but it’s already fixing frustrations I hadn’t articulated, saving time, and helping our team be much more efficient. Thank you!"
2024-10-03,-,"Who knew I could legitimately enjoy task and project management? I’m a business owner with ADHD, and getting a little spike of excitement to use Monday.com keeps me coming back and staying organized. I have the free version now, but I’m 90% sure I will expand to the paid version soon."
2024-10-03,-,It’s great! As a small business owner it’s fundamental to my daily flow
2024-09-29,-,"System is a great communication platform, however fails on true project management workflows. We have been an enterprise user for 3 years, so we see value in the communication aspect, “work management” not so much. When the updates are issued, beware customer service is non responsive. Several issues throughout the years where it takes weeks to months for resolution, some causing temporary stoppage in services. 
To summarize: 
- Use it as a communication and file storage
- Have a secondary process for when, not if their systems are buggy 
- Set a process for archiving and backing up data for the down times
- Have a Super User, as support takes weeks to resolve basic issues majority of time created by their system upgrades and work arounds are a must
- Forget about escalation, that was also left of the roadmap

Best of luck and know what the pros are and limit your scope in the cons department."
2024-09-28,-,Great app!
2024-09-26,-,Removed the option to duplicate entire lists and associated tasks. Assuming this is now a paid for feature. Typical greedy behavior.
2024-09-26,-,"My one-year subscription is about to automatically renew for another year, and nowhere are there any instructions on how to end it. I do not want to renew."
2024-09-24,-,Amazing app to work with teams and have a great system set to go manage well your times.
2024-09-21,-,I’ve been trying to join a board and the owner has been sending me invites over and over. However the invite isn’t sending to me and I cannot join the board. It seems like a great app other than this issue.
2024-09-19,-,"I’m not supposed to be the admin. It made me the admin! This app is terrible. Had more problems with it than any other app I’ve ever used.  Just trying to delete my account so I can go put it in my phone for my boss, but it won’t let me delete my account made me the admin."
2024-09-12,-,"Discovered this app and started using it worked pretty good for a while. Had several jobs in progress and it was nice having a board where me and my partner could input updates every day and share pictures of job sites, until one day out of the blue all our info was wiped out of the system. All the notes, jobs, pictures, gone. I decided to give them another chance thought maybe the app had a glitch, needed an update or something and hopefully it would be good this time. I logged out tried to refresh things, they needed to email me a verification code to verify email and whatever, codes come in and right away they don’t even work says codes have expired. I quit. Gonna find something else that’s maybe more reputable and reliable. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2024-09-06,-,Why not allow desktop view in the app. Or at a minimum all features in app that you can use in your browser. Really is the worse downfall to the app.
2024-09-06,-,This app has zero time blocking functionality which is fundamental to project management. It’s pretty mind blogging this is not part of this app.
2024-09-01,-,Hey
2024-08-29,-,This app keeps me and my team on track with relevant tasks and due dates. It’s easy to use and doesn’t have a ton of distracting features—it’s simple. I highly recommend.
2024-08-28,-,Cannot search everything in the app.
2024-08-27,-,"An amazing piece of CRM. I use Monday for my Foundation and actually want to log in often. I can adapt Monday to my work flow and thought process. I do feel like it’s most often a “Monday” (happy, good start to the week) from this CRM. I’d recommend yes, their responsiveness to feedback and questions via A/Human interaction is top notch. 

I’m treated as a valued customer.
Brad"
2024-08-27,-,"I’m super impressed with this app. It has great UI/UX - ease of use, simplicity. It’s really great at doing exactly what it does - nothing more, nothing less. They are not trying to cram every feature in under the sun and be all things to all people (ahem, ClickUp). This results in an actually enjoyable app experience, that practically serves its purpose as an intuitive, easy to use project management tool."
2024-08-17,-,It’s a nice concept but it did glitch few times.. and I wouldn’t trust team with all my company data.
2024-08-16,-,"Monday is an essential workflow management tool. I find equal value in the board and workdoc features. Yet, the mobile apps do not let you create workdocs.  Why is this? I would love to be able to pull my phone out in a meeting and create a quick doc to capture notes and board tasks. Instead, I have to write a note in Apple Notes and then transfer it to a new Monday workdoc on my computer."
2024-08-15,-,Loops and loops
2024-08-12,-,The mirror columns on my main boards aren’t working. It’s supposed to be a progress bar. The column is grayed out. Works fine on the web. Works fine on my co workers android app. Seems like it is limited to the iOS version of the app because it doesn’t work on my iPad either
2024-08-04,-,"Pretty worthless in this regard. If you like no response, endless reading and product that almost works. This is product is for you."
2024-08-03,-,"As a student who were looking for a project management platform to help in my club, Monday.com is amazing! Besides being for free for college students, it is helping me a lot becoming a better project manager"
2024-08-02,-,It's been a year since we started using MDC and it has literally changed our lives. Less meetings. Less miscommunication. More time for people. WAY more efficient. I swear by this program and have influenced two different clients that I contract for to use it also!
2024-07-30,-,"I’ve been using Monday.com for over 3 years now and have converted many at the company to start using it. 
It’s easy to learn and they are constantly making updates which some other program management tools make you pay for.
I would continue to suggest this for anyone looking to save time and be more efficient!"
2024-07-30,-,"My favorite CRM, I can manage invoices, expenses, projects and clients in just one app. The automation allows all my team to know what is happening and the integrations make easy to have a full panoramic of the company."
2024-07-27,-,"I have to see the same animation explaining to me how a comment works every time I check a comment field, multiple times an hour. Enough is enough. Give us an ability to turn animations off."
2024-07-23,-,I CAN’T SAY ENOUGH BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS SERVICE !!!! I HAVE BEEN ARGUING WITH SOME JERK NAMED EDDIE FOR 30 MINUTES TRYING DESPERATELY TRING TO GET HELP..IF YOU. OWN A BUSINESS DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!
2024-07-22,-,"another app that makes the online version impossible to use on mobile, just so you have to download their app. downloaded just to uninstall."
2024-07-19,-,"Don’t get me wrong, I love the Monday app. It allows you to create super intuitive ways for the team to keep statuses current on everything they’re working on, super efficiently. 

One thing I just realized is that I’d like to be able to click the plus button on the workspace main page and add a document - this will help when I’m away from my computer but I create docs for projects and processes."
2024-07-19,-,"I can’t express how much this helps me keep my goals organized & make sure I achieve them ! I use this for personal & family goals. I didn’t know I was going to love this app THIS much. Its better than anything I tried . I like Notion but it’s way too much that goes into it. This is way more simple and I like the fact that you can add the tasks to your calendar. Also you can see which tasks to do organized for each day. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend for busy people, family’s or goal achievers"
2024-07-12,-,We’ve been using the software for about one month so far. I have been looking for a software program that would do several different things at different levels of the construction process. This software keeps checking off the boxes of things I wanted to be able to do. It has been very user-friendly. And the staff have been able to pick it up quickly. I still have much to learn with it and what it can do but so far it’s been very helpful.
2024-07-06,-,"Monday.com is without a doubt one of the all-time best workflow management softwares in the world, and I’ve used a lot of them.

The app makes is so easy to keep up-to-date on things on-the-go!

However, I often have the need to create new documents for different projects and unfortunately this simple feature isn’t available on the mobile version… Strange that something so basic would be overlooked! It would be extremely helpful for me if this were fixed, so I really hope someone at the company sees this and passes the request along to the development team! 😊🙏🏼🫶🏻

Other than that, it’s quite an exceptional tool!"
2024-07-04,-,It’s a little confusing to me but  it’s my fault. I need to go back and review the videos.
2024-06-27,-,"Impossible to find files, poor integration options with other platforms. Pass."
2024-06-26,-,If you think you need it just get it. Stop thinking about and just do it. Wish I would have years ago for my team. Been using it for a couple weeks now and can’t explain how awesome it is.
2024-06-25,-,The apps nd website work together like Batman and Robbin. The website offers various tools and automations to improve my productive and allows me to spend more time with my clients. The app is great for calling leads and following up on new projects.
2024-06-25,-,"So far super forward to use and my staff writer finds it easy to understand.  Magazine publisher
New to Monday and boy has it made it easier being able to plug in everything so she can see and not have to answer 1000 questions because it is all right in front of her. 

Thank you Monday!!! Very happy biz owner"
2024-06-24,-,Having a really positive experience using Monday.com. Highly recommend.
2024-06-23,-,"I’m in the process of completing a lot of projects in the creative field (blog, nonfiction book, novel, music album, etc.) and while other apps have their place in my workflow and I do use them, Monday.com is by far the most user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and practical app I’ve come across thus far (Alongside Craft, but I use that for actual writing and research archiving rather than project management). The developers deserve a massive amount of credit, as I’m sure it tasks quite a village to create, sustain, monitor, and update such a wonderful software. Keep up the great work!"
2024-06-22,-,"very bad service,what ever they talk about services no any help.
i never recumbent to any person."
2024-06-20,-,✫✬✩✬✫
2024-06-16,-,Great app!
2024-06-15,-,"Monday is the best app out there for tracking goals that require weekly progress tracking with sub-items, updates, and automations!"
2024-06-12,-,"The Gantt view on the iPad app needs scrolling and zooming capabilities using fingers and pinching. 

I signed up to Monday.com hoping to have that capability on iPhone or iPad, so I’m pretty disappointed."
2024-06-10,-,"Weather it’s an ap, a video game, your 6th gen performance car they all share one thing in common. Developers, design engineers and marketing experts do one thing extremely well: ignore feedback from their customers. 

Monday has changed that. They have taken all of the times we said “If it could only do____” from every segment of the business world and rolled it into an ap. Somehow keeping it simple and easy to learn. There are templates for any imaginable niche. The “if this happens do _____” templates are a holy grail. The ability to quickly and efficiently switch between board layouts is even better. If you are not using Monday to track your business one of your competitors is and they are way ahead of the game. Scheduling a demo is quick, their customer support team is top notch and are always available. I encourage anyone not using this ap to schedule a demo. It won’t take you long to make the switch to Monday."
2024-06-07,-,"The app is nearly unusable for me unfortunately. I would love to be able to use the iPad app in my workflow, but the fact that sorting/filtering does not mimic what you see in the desktop app is terribly frustrating. It sounds like this has been an issue for awhile and has never been addressed."
2024-06-07,-,My team uses Monday and I love how customizable and functional it is!!!
2024-06-04,-,"A bad copy of the web version of monday.com, lacking lots of key features available on the web and has very poor offline performance.  Can post updates with pictures until you have enough bandwidth to watch netflix."
2024-06-01,-,I love Monday.com. I would consider myself a super user. Always ways to improve but I live in it. There are a few improvements I think are needed for a company our size- 350+ . One is definitely the web app! Changes are not saved and it is very glitchy. For what we pay this should definitely be addressed.
2024-05-22,-,I run 3 different businesses with 4 contractors. This helps me keep it all running smoothly.
2024-05-15,-,"Monday.com is our go to tool to keep everything organized for our team and our clients. We don’t know what we would do without it, it has made our workflow so much better."
2024-05-08,-,"The app is so glitchy and it's very frustrating. Items don't load, colors randomly change in the status column, changes don't save. It's impossible to use the website on an iPad and the app is extremely frustrating. I like the potential, but the glitches keep slowing me down."
2024-05-07,-,Great help to stay organized
2024-04-26,-,"There’s a lot of bugs that have yet to be fixed and some that are starting to happen as I type this message. Whenever I try to copy/paste task lists, it doesn’t always include the actual tasks so I have to redo it. The colors also glitch often and don’t show as the assigned one checked off. For example, “stuck” is red and “done” is green. When my employees check off “done” it’ll show as red and can be confusing as we’re in a quick-paced work environment and they sometimes just glance at the list to see what needs to be done. The new issue that’s developed today, is that my sub items have quite literally disappeared from the lists. It’s pretty inconvenient having to constantly edit the lists honestly"
2024-04-26,-,"I Love the concept of Mondays.Com; it has contributed to many of the great trips and projects achievements for Me and The Mirtil Family! Best Wishes,

Ruth 

Note:
Thank You!"
2024-04-25,-,"If your organization uses Okta, don’t bother. The effort needed to log into the Monday app every day isn’t worth the hassle."
2024-04-20,-,"I have tried to delete my account and it won’t let me. I tried to deactivate my account to remove me as the user and it does not allow me to. I tried messaging for help to delete my account and it keeps telling me, “try again, something went wrong.” What do I do? Will someone please help me!"
2024-04-19,-,Love that it keeps everyone accountable and organized!!
2024-04-18,-,I loooooooooooooooooooooooooove using it
2024-04-17,-,Love Monday.come in general and the app just makes it that much better. Making quick edits on the go makes life easy!
2024-04-13,-,"I use Monday with my team, I connect online on browser, theexperience is better than the app!"
2024-04-12,-,Mobile app is a bit limited. No admin functions really.
2024-04-10,-,"Upcharges, surcharges, scam pricing. 

Here’s how it works: To make their software actually work you need to buy “automations” 🙄

Everything , and I mean every single thing counts as an automation .

I pay for software , though so I get it.. so I paid for the expensive Pro plan.

3 days later it “wasn’t enough”. We barely used it!

I even hired a consultant to make sure we had set it up correctly. 

They wouldn’t refund unused days, and I paid for a year.

Scam pricing. Mediocre product."
2024-04-10,-,"I have an iPhone 15 and still, the screen provides very little information for what I can see at a time. From the home page navigating to sub tasks requires so many taps and nesting that I hate using it on mobile."
2024-04-02,-,This app is AMAZING. The flexibility in organization is exactly what I’ve been looking for since forever. I’m too excited to even wait for the results to leave a review. Will leave another after I’ve had it more than 10 minutes….
2024-03-30,-,"I’ve had this app installed for a year or two, and it’s never been able to do the most basic thing: display the correct items in a given view. It displays items that have been closed out, or moved to another grouping, in the wrong grouping. Even after waiting for the view to refresh, it’s still inaccurate. The app is unusable on mobile."
2024-03-29,-,"My company uses Monday to assign our appointments and result leads. I am constantly dealing with insane lag times. Takes forever for my appt list to load. We as a company have missed dozens of appts because the appt lists don’t update in time. You have to wait sometimes 3 mins just for the lists to update properly. When we save our entries, they always get deleted. When you use an app on  daily for crucial situations, you need it to be reliable. And this app is not reliable at all. Our owner is too busy to find a new program and we had high hopes with Monday. As a company we all cannot stand it anymore."
2024-03-25,-,"Frustrated with how the app works in iOS and does not preform as it should. There are so many bugs that Monday.com refuses to address and fix/resolve in a timely manner. Poor testing to insure everything is working as it should for every menu and functionality. Does not up update or refresh immediately as it should. Great concept, extremely poor execution and testing!!"
2024-03-21,-,Used it then stopped as soon as we got our first invoice and saw where they were based.
2024-03-19,-,"Love that the app on a phone lets you look at your list to complete. It is harder to create items on the Phone app. It is easier to look at different views on a desktop version. I love the night view with different colors for each group.

I do wish that you could make a different boards and list different colors underneath work spaces. It would also be nice to be able to change a home workspace."
2024-03-18,-,Horrible app.
2024-03-13,-,Very easy and useful to understand
2024-03-06,-,"Super simple software program.
Very useful logging job site work,along with insight and info.
Would definitely recommend to others.
😁"
2024-02-28,-,The app barely works. It doesn’t update when you assign someone to something it takes a long time to show up in my work. Deleted boards still show up in users phones. Very disappointed.
2024-02-22,-,"It’s so good, I can’t believe it’s free."
2024-02-21,-,"I thought I signed up for all functionality. I paid for 5 licenses and then find out it is only for CRM and not Workspace. Very misleading.
Then it is impossible to get anyone on line to speak to."
2024-02-20,-,"Really like this app, absolutely recommend to any and everyone for work AND normal life. Best thing: information All in one place. Worst thing: UI maybe a bit better but it still is pretty good."
2024-02-16,-,Monday.com is great but for now the app is unusable. Boards are never in sync even when attempting to manually refresh everything.
2024-02-14,-,I asked for my account to be deleted and went through all the appropriate steps to delete it and it is still popping up!!!’ I have tried contacting customer support but no luck even reporting the problem. Next step will be to report to  the Better Business Buteau!
2024-02-13,-,"Seriously the only way I get anything accomplished with efficiency is through utilizing Monday. I’m adding to my title “Digitally Organized Queen” 💁🏻‍♀️
Thanks Monday"
2024-02-12,-,Fine for desktop but freezes all the time on mobile
2024-02-12,-,I will be the first to admit I was a little skeptical that this would just make me work harder or be confusing. However I love how good it feels to track all our hard work as a non profit. Still learning all the capabilities it has to offer. Over all definitely helps with time management.
2024-02-12,-,"Not sure what changed, but new Calendar View UX/UI is not good. Barely can see the week. Uses 60% of the screen. Clicking on events, now they don’t open. This was a poor design change decision. Please update, so when we click events in calendar it opens. Iphone user"
2024-02-09,-,Will not let me log in with Apple ID please fix asap as a business we are very intrigued fix asap
2024-02-05,-,Love the way this app is designed but there seems to be a major glitch and I can’t add a task. When I click to add a task under the Today view it asks me to select a board and then sits on the loading screen for the boards and never loads the boards. Please fix this glitch and I will update my review (I have an iPhone 13).
2024-02-04,-,My team and I started using Monday CRM and it has helped us quadruple our productivity and help keep our team on the same page with work flow. I highly recommend it
2024-02-02,-,"Unable to re-activate “Update,” column back to team tasks.  Otherwise pretty cool app. Thanks!"
2024-01-31,-,"So just like the title I have tried so so so many apps but this one is truly one that has helped me stay organized 

It’s also easy to use ; many apps I have tried have the same template in a different color , I think I am trying another app but no it’s just a different name but monday is different, unique and original."
