"Good looking, lightweight, durable, and good features We got this on a treasure truck discount a while back to replace my wife's carry-on that broke. Black may not have been her first choice but it honestly does look pretty sharp. We haven't used this on a trip yet, but from opening the box and checking it out, it seems very well designed and built. I travel a lot more than she does, and I'm actually a little jealous that it was hers that broke and she gets this nice new one.It has a nice complement of pockets and straps for organizing your clothes and other travel necessities. There's an expansion ""joint"" for when you need to bring a little bit extra. The 360 spinner wheels are something my wife never put much importance on but I can't imagine not having them. The integrated TSA-friendly lock is also a nice touch and less hassle than using a separate padlock.What I think we are going to like the most about this is the durable hardside construction. Our 12-year-old wedding-gift luggage set, of which I'm still using mine, is soft-sided and is definitely showing the abuse that airline baggage handlers have put it through. That set is also Samsonite, by the way, so we already know the brand stands for high quality and longevity. This new one has a durable polycarbonate outer shell and I'm hoping it will hold up to rough handling much better than the soft ones.",2023-01-01
"Great overhead suitcase This was the first hard shell overhead suitcase I had purchased and was quite pleased.  It is durable, has more space than I expected, rolls easily, and the attached lock is easy to deal with.  The one feature I would have liked to have on it is a handle on the bottom that would make it easier to grasp when putting it in the overhead.",2023-01-01
"Suitcases themselves are Great... wheels suck. Let me start by saying I am a longtime Samsonite fan. All of my luggage has been Samsonite. I travel a-l-o-t for work and have loved the Samsonite brand for durability and travel smarts. Well, so far, this luggage set seems to be pretty durable but as far as the travel smarts... they missed the mark when it comes to the wheels.Let's start with the Good. I went with hard-sided this time as these are the polycarbonate which hold up far better to the grind of being thrown around by luggage handlers at the airports. From all of my reading, the non-polycarbonate type just don't hold up to that. Not to mention, much of my type of travel (I work in the film industry) is in and out of cars, along side my kit and other gear being loaded in and out... so lots of tossing and banging around. And they have held up like a champ so far (about a year of ownership so far & many, many trips since). Since they are hard sided, they lack the various external pockets that their non-hard sided counterparts have, but that is par for the course and is a trade-off for the durability.  They do have a much better clothing strap system inside than my previous Samsonite luggage. It really seems to hold everything in place far better and snug. In addition, on the one side has that typical zippered net closure as well. All three pieces have the expandability zippers and surprisingly (for this consummate overpacker), I don't need to utilize them much... nice to have though.One sort of wonky thing for me is, that they have an integrated TSA compatible lock that the zippers connect into, with a combination you can set. It's wonky because I have a difficult time with it. Maybe it's because of the length of my nails as I keep them fairly long, I have no idea. And it's not that I can't use it, I just seem to fight with it, especially the combination dials. Some may not have issues with it... might just be me.My biggest issue is the wheels... they just stink. I mean, horrible. The only ones that are somewhat okay, are on the biggest suitcase, but even that.. they just don't wheel great. Especially on any sort of carpet or textured surface... which is well, many surfaces you are rolling it on.  And when you get any sort of bump... like a transition at a doorway, forget it... they just won't go over it.  And the smaller suitcases? Ugh... just awful for wheeling. Most people like to or Need to attach some other bag to the handle of their main suitcase. Whether that be a toiletry bag, a computer bag a backpack or something else.... I haven't found one that doesn't want to dump the suitcase over. And trying to roll them, with something on top, attached to handle is like pushing it through quicksand. The concept that these are supposed to be spinner wheels is completely lost. You are constantly fighting it!  I literally give up and use them all like an old school suitcase that only has two wheels! Which defeats the purpose of buying a suitcase set with spinner wheels. And the smaller the suitcase, the worse it gets. The largest suitcase, when it's full... it's very difficult for me to use in a non-upright position as it's heavy. It's easier to roll as it has more weight to it (when full), but it's still difficult. Samsonite definitely missed the mark with these wheels. It's sad as it's the first luggage set I've not really been happy with.I'm just fortunate that most of my travel is by car and I usually have a cart with me for my mobile office so it's not as important. If I was traveling more by plane... I'd really be annoyed and probably would have returned it. The wheels are just horrible. So if you are traveling a lot where the wheels on the suitcase are expressly important.. make sure you test these out sufficiently or just try something else, as much as this Samsonite fan is pained to say that.",2023-01-01
"Great Product, but read this IMPORTANT ADVICE if shopping for your first hard suitcase This is a very good quality suitcase.  It was the first hard case that I've bought.  For the most part, I am satisfied, but I wish I had known a couple more bits of information before I purchased.  If you are also buying YOUR FIRST HARD CASE, read these IMPORTANT TIPS.  TIP #1: This case closes with a ZIPPER ONLY.  It does not have a latch.  Zipper-only hard cases are more vulnerable to malfunction because zippers can break or split apart with stress or excessive wear.  If the zipper splits on this case, you do will have a latch as a backup method to keep your case closed and you may find your self in a predicament when you need to check your broken-zippered bag at the airport.  Therefore, if you buy this case, be sure to also buy luggage straps.  Luggage straps are extremely effective to keep your case closed and will help prevent excessive stress or damage to the zipper.  When buying luggage straps, write your initials on each strap with a permanent marker.  This will not only help identify your bag in a busy airport, but also make the straps less desirable for thieves.  TIP #2: I bought the (very large) 28-inch version of this case because I wanted to have plenty of space to pack for long international trips.  In hindsight, I wish I had bought a size or two smaller because filling up a case this big with normal items like clothing, shoes, and toiletries will almost always put you over the airline weight limits (and be very heavy to lift).  The case is very light, but I can only fill it up about 75% to avoid paying the ""excess weight"" fees.  With the case being 25% empty, I have lots of open space in the bag and my belongings bounce around inside.  When I arrive at my destination, I often find my loosely packed belongings out of order and disheveled.  For my next suitcase, I will buy something a tad bit smaller so I can fill 90% or 100%.  When filled to 90-100%, my belongings would be tightly packed and more secure inside.",2023-01-01
"Nice piece I just received this. I was skeptical about the size maybe being too small. I check my luggage because it was too heavy to carry. But, the size is perfect.  This suitcase is very lightweight as opposed to a Hartman suitcase I have used for 10 years. Hartman, empty is heavy. One of the most important features I like about a hard shell case is it can be cleaned before you toss it up on your bed to unload it. It rolls great on floor and carpet. Amazon says it was made in Taiwan but the box says Thailand. Making the decision on the endless options of hardshell luggage was, that it WAS NOT made in China. That was my decision maker.",2023-01-01
 RECOMMEND THIS LUGGAGE Fist flight ✈️ about 12 hours with an change plane and the beat up from transfer than airport handling not very nice lol it took that like a pro nothing happened not even a dent..and I see others brands broken or come zipper ripped so well I RECOMMEND THIS LUGGAGE,2023-01-01
"durable I ordered 2 for our big trip. They did well on the train, ship, and airport check in.  We travel a lot and I hope this trend continues.  The airline is the worst. One cloth bag we bought for a similar price was ripped in the back on the first time flying.  That is when we started looking for a hard side.  So far it is durable and a good price.",2023-01-01
"Great suitcase I bought the 24” for a recent trip to EU. It held up great through all the checked bagging. I pulled it all around the cobbled streets of Prague, I was afraid a wheel would pop off but it did great!The expandability saved my life, I would not have been able to pack everything without it.I love that the suitcase alone is so light, I packed it to the brim, fully expanded and I was still under the 50lb limit.I do wish that it came with instructions on how to set your lock. I had to YouTube how to do this. I also with the handle had some cushion like my samsonite carryon. But that would just be an added bonus. All in all, I highly recommend.",2023-01-01
handle is difficult to put down Nice lightweight suitcase.  But the handle is not a smooth actuator.  Sometimes it’s a fight to get it to release.,2023-01-01
Excellent Carry On Was delivered in excellent condition but was missing the TSA key to change the combination lock.  Otherwise holds a lot more than I would have thought.,2023-01-02
Durable suitcase I love the red color.  This suitcase is easy to wheel around the airport.  I was able to fit in all my stuff without using the expander feature.,2023-01-02
"Didn’t qualify as carry-on on Frontier flight I thought that buying a 20”, I would be able to use it as a carry-on, but it was too thick.  I had to spend $100 to check it for both flights.",2023-01-02

"Holds an amazing amount I received this carry-on for a Christmas gift. I love it! I am known for my ability to pack lots into a small bag. This new bag can hold lots if you pack smart. Using all my tricks, I can pack for two weeks in this carry-on bag!",2023-01-02
"No dividers inside... Overall a good value, just the very basics in a case. If that is what you are looking for, this will serve the purpose well.",2023-01-02
"Samsonite Omni luggage!!! Well pleased!!! Arrived as promised. Going on a cruise in April, will be used. Very nice looking.",2023-01-02

Arrived on time The carry on suitcase was good quality & did not disappoint.  It expands which is a great feature,2023-01-02
Wonderful Suitcase I've had this suitcase for 5+ years and it still feels new. The suitcase is very durable and it's lightweight. I've taken it all across the world and have had no problems. It's very sturdy and and the exterior is made up of a very nice grippy material. The zippers and wheels are very smooth. I highly reccomend this suitcase to everyone.,2023-01-02
"Peso y diseño! Me gusto totalmente, no esperaba otra cosa!!",2023-01-02
"Just What I Needed I have tried various types of luggage and something was lacking in every single one.  I thought I would try another Samsonite, my older one wasn't a spinner.  I took this on a short 6 day trip to Mexico and I love it.  I pack very light and it was only half full.  Everything fit nicely with room to spare for things I bought.  It rolled nicely as long as there was no carpet.  But I have never had a bag roll on carpet very well.  I like the attached TSA lock, so I don't have my other one dangling.  The telescoping handle worked very smoothly.  I will purchase the 24"" one the next time I go on a longer trip.",2023-01-03
Easy to maneuver I have the carry on size of this suitcase.  I bought the larger one and am especially pleased with its size and ease of movement.,2023-01-03
"Exceeds the maximum linear dimension of 62”! The product is light weight and appears to be durable. Had I known the linear size was 65.5” which exceeds the airlines maximum of 62”, I would’ve never purchased two of these.  We leave on our trip tomorrow and it is too late to find replacements.  We will have to pay oversized baggage fees.  I’d recommend the TravelPro Maxlite 28 inch Hardside as it meets the 62” linear maximum.",2023-01-03
"Perfect!! Lightweight, great carry on. Holds plenty",2023-01-03
Fits everything. Really liked the color. Great size for two people. Would recommend this luggage.  Sturdy and rolls well. Took it to our trip from SFO to Florida and we easily identified it coming out of luggage carousel.,2023-01-03
"Great Suitcase We added this carry-on to our current set.  They are very light, yet sturdy.  Quick shipping from the seller was a plus.",2023-01-03
NOT ORANGE BUT COPPER COLOR The color and not having a front flap are the only two things lacking in this piece. I was excited to get orang or burnt orange but it was actually copper penny colored. Not what I wanted. Extremely well made looking and zippers were smooth and depth was impressive.,2023-01-03
Reliable luggage This luggage is light weight and easy to use. I can also charge my phone. It’s very convenient.,2023-01-03
"Smart suitcase, looks like it is built to last My last carry on suitcase served me well for over 12 years, accompanying me on countless trips, usually over-stuffed, through winter weather, through slush and rain and dragged across the cobble-stone streets in Berlin. In the last couple years it began to show it's age, but it wasn't until the handle finally ripped off and the inner lining tore a small hole on my most recent trip that I admitted it was finally time to move on.My initial inclination was to buy something cheap - I don't need fancy luggage, I got student loans to pay... So I was poking around and looking at options in the $30 - $40 market, and there were some that looked ok. But then I would dig into the reviews and read about them breaking on the first trip, or having stuck wheels or finicky handles... Not feeling satisfied I put off the purchase for a while. I went to a store and looked at some of these models in person, and I was startled by how flimsy they felt in person. They were not built to handle the abuse of transatlantic air-travel. Feeling ambivalent, I put off the decision yet again.Fast forward to Tuesday of this week, no suitcase purchased, my flight is Friday morning. I pull my old trusty carry-on out of storage and seriously debate taking it on one last journey... just one more time?? The suitcase does not want. So I come back to Amazon and search again until I find this suitcase. It's not super cheap, but it's not expensive either, and it has a great color, and good reviews, and it sturdy in the photos... I'm still undecided, but, well, clock is ticking, I bite the bullet.Suitcase arrived just in time for my flight :-) My roommate carried the box upstairs for me this afternoon and when I thanked her, commented on how light it was. As soon as I open it I am relieved, this is a strong and sturdy suitcase, and it looks smart. The handle is long, and slides out easily, doesn't rattle around like those other flimsier models did. Wheels are seemingly good quality. The body looks quite durable and scratch resistant, the zipper is good quality, oh and there's even a lock. It holds a lot of stuff for how small it is, and it is expandable which is helpful for people who sometimes overpack.UPDATE: Suitcase held up perfectly over 4 four flights over the holidays, on two of which it actually had to be checked because the flight was very full. Not a single scratch or dent, no signs of wear, and it was easy to travel with - rolled smoothly and easily, sturdy handle.",2023-01-03
AWESOME! SAMSONITE THE BEST HANDS DOWN!,2023-01-03
"Lightweight for sure, not sure on durability. Took it on a multi-flight trip to Europe and back, easy to move throughout the airport and doesn't show wear or tear, but it is lightweight. Fingers crossed it holds up, because everything fits in there!",2023-01-03
"Hard sided luggage I really like the look and it seems sturdy, but I have to return it. It’s too big for me.",2023-01-03

Great luggage We brought this set for my daughter for a graduation/Christmas gift she has been very pleased with the set.,2023-01-03
"Basic and lightweight It's basic, lightweight, and more spacious than it appears in the picture. Purple color is accurate which is what my daughter loved about it. Delivery box was semi-open and item arrived with a slight scratch at the base but no consequential damage. Delivery date was perfect - it arrived earlier than expected. Overall, I'm satisfied.",2023-01-03
Very lightweight Very surprised that it has a TSA lock. Nice color spins like a dream.,2023-01-03

Great Quality! This suitcase set is well worth the money.  Great quality as expected from Samsonite.,2023-01-03
Great price for good quality Just what I needed. Only a few trips (by air) and held up well. I will probably add a few more for an upcoming international trip. Only 4 stars on durability since limited use.,2023-01-03
"Lovely carry-on and great for arthritic hands I haven't actually travelled with this yet, but my husband is using it on a golfing trip and was able to pack an amazing amount of clothing (but not his clubs!) into this little carry-on. I have lost all cartilage in my thumbs and can no longer unfasten the strap closures on the inside of most suitcases, which require a strong pinching motion.  The interior of this suitcase not only has a totally enclosable mesh cover for enclosing one side (and it works beautifully), but the strap closure for the other side is a simple twist motion rather than the typical pinching motion of other suitcases. I won't have to ask for help every time I open my suitcase anymore!! I just hope my husband doesn't try to keep it for himself when he returns from his golf trip!!",2023-01-03
"Hardside, NOT hardshell! While I really love my luggage, I learned after buying these that there is a difference between HARDSIDE and HARDSHELL. These are hardside, meaning they are not one tough piece of plastic of whatever material Samsonite uses to make these. It's a flexible piece of material that, while durable, is not unbendable. If you've ever felt or picked up a car bumper, and it's sort of wobbly and flexible, though somewhat hard - that is what this luggage is like.It is NOT a hardshell luggage set. A hardshell, like a turtle's shell, doesn't move and stays in place. You can knock on it and throw it around; it's not moving. This luggage is not that. These are flexible and a step below hardshell.Another thing to note for these is that they are a gritty material. You will not be able to put stickers or things on them as the material feels more akin to sandpaper than any smooth surface.All this said, I do recommend the product. I've used hardshell Samsonite and now own a set of these, and the results are the end of the day are the same. This luggage properly protected everything, and I am satisfied with it. I am just not satisfied with the feel of the outside or its flexibility.",2023-01-03
"Survived a multi-country trip and being dragged all over India I bought two of these for a multi-country trip and then being dragged in various hotels and states in India. WARNING: Although we had no cracks/breakage, this is NOT a 100% hardtop suitcase, it is more of a hard top like the front hood of a car. There IS resistance if you press on it. The suitcase holds a lot and the zippers work well, but we also bought extra travel locks for security and didn't rely on the locks that came with the suitcase. We bought 2 of the largest sizes and were extremely happy with them. Unlike some commenters we had no problems with the wheels, although the handles occasionally stuck. I would buy these again for international travel. However if you have cameras, musical instruments, or something priceless that absolutely MUST be in a hardback suitcase, invest in a Rimowa or Tumi from one of their boutiques. I was able to fit souvenirs, regular clothing, and three dresses and a full suit for weddings inside. Would purchase again.",2023-01-04
Can’t go wrong with Samsonite Bought these to replace a 30 year old set of soft-sided luggage and I’m glad I did! So easy to maneuver and it fits way more than I thought it would. The nesting makes them easier to store when not in use and the options for colors and patterns is great.,2023-01-04
Room for activities I purchased this suitcase for a trip to the UK in December 2022 for ten days. This case has plenty of room for heavier winter clothing and other items. I couldn't be happier with the purchase.,2023-01-04

Producto Perfecto Excelente producto,2023-01-04
"Great for desktop gaming PCs. In case you were wondering if you can travel with your gaming computer and monitor using this case…you can! Pictured is an in-progress photo of me packing my computer and monitor in the Samsonite. I padded the empty space with clothes and other items, and my computer arrived perfect and undamaged on both departure/return trips. Note that I mostly disassembled my computer and added special protection around some items (Eg. The PSU; the GPU). I was able to leave my mobo CPU fan on, though.It helped that I have a workbench style computer case, but if your tower and monitor can both fit in this, I can’t see why this set up wouldn’t work for you. Sensible usage of bubble wrap, newspaper, twine, and tape will protect your gear and make it so that the contents don’t move around.I will say that despite the reviews on the quality, I was careful to handle the handles, as my set up was clocking in at 75 lbs. It was probably built for that kind of weight, but I wanted to play it safe and tried carrying this as infrequently as possible. When I did, I used both handles and tried to put as much of the weight as I could against my body. Again, probably not necessary but just a precaution.Also — as others pointed out, filling this suitcase up, computer or not, will likely put you past the 50lb limit seen on most airlines, so you’ll have to shell out additional money (~$100). But if you’re flying with a PC, you were probably already prepared to incur this cost.During my last non-traveling-with-a-desktop-PC trip, where I was away for 3 weeks, I was actually able to fill this up close to capacity and was just under 50lbs. However, the contents included a garment bag (suits for a wedding), an empty duffel bag (for other traveling within the trip), and non-perishable groceries. Things that take up a lot of space that aren’t so heavy. Protip: don’t pack hardcover books, they are sneaky heavy and add up.",2023-01-04
"Survived flight packed full at 79lbs Used it for relocating overseas. It was a little shorter internally than I'd expected from the item description of it's dimensions. Still, to survive in good condition packed to the weight I flew with it is pretty good. No doubts it will last for many years with how often I fly with checked luggage this size.",2023-01-04
"Lightweight and easily versatile I purchased the 3 pieces set because the 29"" expandable was not available by itself in the color I wanted in the time I needed it.  I was surprised at how light this suitcase is and also, being so big, easy to handle.  I was able to fit everything I needed and still had plenty of room without having to expand it.  I feel that if you expand such a big suitcase, it may become less stable and harder to move around.  Keep in mind that these wonderful spinner wheels are made to run smoothly only on airport surfaces - no rugs, or sidewalks.  I had a slightly more difficult time rolling it from the parking lot to the terminal as the road surfaces are rougher and less even.  Aside from that, it makes a world of a difference to use a spinner rather than the traditional 2 wheeled suitcases.  I own a fabric Travel Pro set that is in very good shape and I have used for many years but it has 2 wheels and it is much heavier - so time to upgrade.  I am happy with  my purchase.  As far as the dimensions, I don't know who took them - I was worried that the 29 inch would be too big and I would have to pay over size charges but NOPE.  I  measured it right out of the box and the overall dimensions including the wheels was 61 inches (length + width + height) which is under the 62"" maximum required by the airlines.  I packed stuff for 8 days and even though I was allowed 70 lb. in my checked baggage, I was only at 62 lbs.  The weight of the suitcase itself is a big help.  I did see a few superficial scratches on it, only after the first trip, but it is to be expected.  I am not worried about scratches - they are inevitable - in my opinion.  So with that said, I will most likely end up buying another set for my husband.  The carryon is also the perfect size and I was pleasantly surprised at how much stuff I can fit in it.  I used to to stuff all the heavy goodies I bought abroad, including liquids, and I checked it as a regular bag.  The medium 25"" is a good size - no so medium - more like a large suitcase but I have not used it yet.  I believe the 25"" is most likely going to be my clothing suitcase and the larger one will be the everything else and souvenir b ag - as it holds tons of stuff.  Very happy with my purchase.",2023-01-04

"Some Airlines Definitely Think The Bag Is Oversized Luggage is big and roomy - so you can pack for a multiple week trip without any trouble.  The only problem I have with this bag is that it's considered oversized by lots of airlines - for example Icelandic Air charges extra and treats bags with a L+W+H (including wheels)  greater than 62 inches as oversized.  This bag - at 30.5"" + 21.5""+ 13.5"" comes in at 65.5"" sort of annoying.  On our last trip to Iceland we ended up having to go to two different places to collect our bags - normal checked luggage and oversized.  Had I known that this size bag would be considered oversized I would not have purchased it.",2023-01-04

"Lock on middle size suitcase broke first trip to Europe Sorry about the lock on the middle suitcase, didn't work after three weeks so we kept it unlocked. WISH I COULD RETURN THAT ONE SUITCASE BUT IT WAS PURCGASED AS A SET.I loved the beautiful blue color and that it expands. We purchased the Samsonite compressible plastic bags and used them quite successfully to compress our clothes and place them compactly, a big plus. The wheels are a really night feature. Did enjoy having two compartments, one with a mesh to separate the half of the suitcase, one that has two straps with a clasp. One small place on internal side of suitcase, didn't hold much and no other pockets. That was OK.Did have a couple of scratch marks on the middle suitcase after our 23 day trip but guess that is to be expected, didn't dent. Loved to easily see the suitcase on the belt. Awesome visual.My husband thinks we should have just purchased two of the middle size suitcases. They are light weight and easier to manage on the cobble stones of the European street. Keep in mind in Europe there are times when you get off your transportation when you need to carry your bags up or down the stairs, not too often but it happens.Shall add that if you are traveling after a cruise in Europe on an airplane the smallest bag of the three is not eligible as a carry on bag. Europeans have a smaller size that is appropriate as a carry on and believe me the smaller one in this set works well but you must pay to have it as a PAID bag. Our regret, decided not to bring the largest suitcase but wished we had. We bought another in Venice (a size equivalent to the middle one in this set ) for 45 euros this in a bright yellow so we could get back to the US .",2023-01-04

" feature I didn't think about at purchase helped me The size is good for short trips.  The combination lock kept me from a possible argument when picking my bag up at baggage claim.  A woman came up to me as I was exiting the baggage claim area questioning if I had ""my bag"" and not hers.  Realizing there were probably many bags like the one I just purchased, I quickly dialed in my combination and popped the latches.  Argument or further discussion not necessary.",2023-01-05

"Handle popped The handle popped on the first time using this piece of luggage!  Hard to Manuver, not lightweight and handle popped in the first time using on January 15th 2023",2023-01-05
Excellent quality!!!! I have used Samsonite luggage for 30 years. It never made me down.,2023-01-05
"Good value for the money We bought these before a 3-week romp all over Europe. No damage, easy to maneuver, and very light.",2023-01-05
Great medium sized option Well designed and very sturdy.  TSA Locking option is great and no longer need to worry about extra lock.  Great option and at a good price point.,2023-01-05
Great luggage but still giving it 4 stars.. It's a great luggage! I love the design and the weight and the way it maneuvers.But it doesn't come with instructions on how to change the combination lock!They should have made the suitcase with instructions and if they are going to sell it internationally. But he manual only shows pictures without directions.How are you supposed to know there is no KEY because it does not come with it - or unless you read the fine print - that most people don't lolI had to laugh out loud when people gave a bad review because they thought the key was missing lolSo unless you have an intelligent child who could read pictures you won't know how to change the combination. That just sucks for Samsonite lol,2023-01-05
Good small suitcase I liked the size and weight and was able to get a good amount of stuff into it. One problems was the release handle for rolling the suitcase. One of the positions did not seem to hold and dropped down or extended up so I had only the highest or lowest positions for rolling.  I've only used the product for one trip so maybe I'm not operating the release properly.,2023-01-05
"Flimsy Handle, Lock is a Joke Pros:  - Light weight  - Should fit in any carry-on luggage compartment  - Color stands out in a world of boring black and gray suitcasesCons:  - Flimsy is an understatement when describing the handle. Expect it to snap off.  - I'm 6' 0"". If that handle snaps, I'll need to become a hunchback to wheel it around. No thank you.  - A 5-year old could pick/break the lock. It's a joke. Don't bother.  - Did I mention the lock is an insult to locks? Awkward design. And it's a joke.",2023-01-05
"Decent for the price Pictures make it look super solid. In actuality it's a super flimsy/cheap hardened piece of plastic suitcase. Worse yet, at least 10% of your flight will have this same suitcase, so you'll need to affix some type of identifying marker. Yes, it is fairly lightweight and maneuvers better than off-brand stuff.This is 2022 absolute baseline kinda-hard luggage. Really nothing spectacular.",2023-01-05
"Perfect Set for Extended Travel! Finally got the chance to use this luggage set.  Just spent nearly a month touring Europe with this set.  We flew to Paris from Chicago.  Then we flew from Paris to Madrid and then from Madrid to Rome.  Then we took trains all over Italy, a cruise throughout Greece and some other stops in Monaco and France.  We carried not only enough clothes for a long trip but we also got married in the Greek Islands so we also had a wedding gown and tux in here as well.  To say that our luggage needed to be spacious, easily maneuverable, and strong enough to bear up to that much travel without wrecking our clothes is an understatement.  We chose Samsonite as my previous set was 16 years old and still going strong.  To see how the all wheel luggage performed we went to a nearby Samsonite store.  The ultra lite series seemed entirely too flimsy for our needs and we decided on this set.  I read all the reviews online and, despite being concerned about the one review I saw about the large bag being beyond regulation size, I ordered this set.  Now on the other side of our trip I can tell you not once did any airline mention the bag's total dimensions (to be honest I've never seen an airline baggage handler with a tape measure and really think they only care if it makes weight) and how many times we discussed during the trip how great this luggage set had performed.  We planned at the start that we would pack without unzipping the 2"" extensions to start and would know we had bought enough souvenirs once all three bags had been extended.  It all worked exactly as planned.  The bags were sturdy and well balanced.  We were easily able to put our backpacks and carryon bags on top of these and not need to keep a hold of them to keep them from tipping.  We did get one scratch on the large bag but it is not really noticeable.  Hope this long review helps as I was on the fence from the previous reviews on whether to buy or not and knew I would give this set the great review it deserved once home.",2023-01-05
"Too Big I'm actually very happy with the suitcase itself, its very light (empty), and seems to roll well.  I've used it a few times, and I do wonder how well it'll last compared to my regular soft sides, time will tell.  My 2 negatives are that it is actually too big.  I bought this to pack for longer trips, but as a previous review stated, you can not pack it to 100%, because you will be well over the weight limit.  And therefore, your belongs are not 'snugly' packed, so they will be in dis-aray when you get to your destination.  Also inside, one side has a mesh zipper to zip up that entire one side.  Works decently, I pretty much pack everything in that side, and it stays 'snug'.  the other side has a big X type of strap to hold things in place.  This is not well designed, bc the suitcase is very large the X straps leave very large openings, and even if you packed that side snugly, there will not be really strapped in snug.  My opinion, and what i'm looking for now, is a smaller size suitcase, where I can fill to 100% and not be over the weight limit :)",2023-01-05

Love it! This is my favorite luggage now. It fits everything I need and more! plus I can carry on my travels easily.,2023-01-05
Little small Not a bad piece of luggage but it is small,2023-01-05
"Handle feels like its going to fall off My main beef with the luggage is the handle, when fully extended, feels really flimsy, is loose, and I feel like it will likely break at an inopportune moment.  Because of the wobble, its difficult to push the luggage on all 4 wheels.  I have to pull it old school, on two wheels.  I dont recommend this luggage.",2023-01-05
Great item for quick travel. Great fast travel item,2023-01-05
Broke first time using it. We just took our first trip with these suitcases and one of the wheels on the biggest suitcase broke off on our trip home from Mexico. Completely stripped from the screws. We're extremely disappointed.,2023-01-05

"Samsonite Luggage Great color, move smoothly, will see how it holds up with International travel this weekend.weighs 8 + pounds, some others are lighter willing to go with it if case is stronger than than Travelers Choice case which cracked after one international flight.",2023-01-05
"Light Weight The luggage stood up to several flights, airports and train journeys.Very pleased.",2023-01-05
"This luggage is exactly what she was looking for! I purchased this beautiful piece of luggage as a college graduation, Christmas, and birthday gift for our granddaughter, as all of those ""events"" were taking place in the same week.  I was really pleased with the suitcase when it arrived, and our granddaughter was SO happy to receive it, since she will be doing quite a bit of traveling in the near future now that she has completed her degree from Purdue.",2023-01-05
"Great Price for Great Brand UPDATE (11/22/2018)I took the middle suitcase with me to Europe. I traveled to London, Brussels, Munich, back to Brussels, Paris, Rome, Florence, Venice, back to London, Bristol, Bath, London again before returning to LA in a matter of a few weeks. I traveled by plane (checked baggage), train, bus, Uber’s, subway, and on foot. I can proudly say this suitcase is tuff as nails. I really pushed it past it’s limit and then some. It’s survived gravel, cobblestone roads, and even being dragged up and down stairs by the handle (I know, I know, you’re not SUPPOSED to do that) and it survived without a scratch on the suitcase itself. Which wouldn’t bother me anyway. They’re like a sign of being well travelled, but I digress. The wheels are scratched up, but that’s about it. Lastly, towards the middle through the end of my trip, I tied a duffle bag with a luggage bungee cord (also purchased on Amazon) which just added more weight. The suitcase did not fall over. I highly recommend these suitcases! It’s a great investment.——These just arrived so I’ll update my review after my upcoming trip to Europe. Let me preface this review by saying I’ve only owned the old fashioned fabric suitcases with wheels. My motivation for ordering a more hard shell set of suit cases was for some type of protection against the rain. My last two trips to Central America and Europe were not great. On several occasions my fabric suit cases got soaked in the rain and so did all my stuff.Any who, I did a lot of research before picking this set. I was leaning towards the Amazon brand because I can be cheap, but these had such great reviews. I figured the extra bucks were worth it. I wanted the Caribbean Blue so bad. It looks gorgeous in the photos! But I’m cheap so I ordered black. Still gorgeous.It rolls fine even on carpet so I expect it will survive cobblestone roads. The hard shell case looks protective, but then again I understand it not impenetrable. I expect it will likely get scratches, but that’s the price you pay for frequent travel.I had read other reviews about some annoying plastic on each suitcase. Either it varies by seller or perhaps several sellers have now listened and made changes. Unpacking was simple. It arrived as expected and on time. Each individual suit case was simply wrapped in a plastic bag, similar to a dry cleaners. Then they were stacked into each other similar to Russian dolls. It arrived in one box.My only complaint is there were no instructions for setting up the locks. I had to search for a video on YouTube. I went ahead and posted a video with my review. Hopefully it’s helpful!Thankfully, I have yet to have an issue with getting my luggage mixed up at the carousel so that’s not a concern even now. But I’ll still secretly thing of the Caribbean Blue I was too cheap to pay for.I purchased these for an upcoming trip to Europe later this month so I’ll definitely provide an update once I’m back in October.",2023-01-05
"These hold up. We have had the samsonite omni hardside luggage carry ons as well as checked bag size for a decade. They hold up wonderfully.  You want 100% polycarbonate shell— polycarbonate is very strong. No cracks, no damage, and handles still telescope easily, and wheels roll well unless you load it up heavy with a bag on top… I recommend a conventional 2 wheel suitcase if you are carrying a bag on too of your luggage.  Zipper expansion. Came back for another carry on sized only because our family has grown!  Worth the money!",2023-01-05
Must have! That’s my favorite bag ever!,2023-01-05
"Light weight Overall, a nice product.  It is extremely lightweight and rolls well which is what I was looking for.  It feels a bit flimsy, but hoping it'll suit my carry-on needs.",2023-01-05
"Metal screw in wheel burned through the plastic I’ve had this suitcase for 9 months and traveled pretty much every other week. Up until today I would have given it 5 stars. However, while I was walking with the bag behind me the metal screw piece on the wheel melted through the plastic holding the wheel to the suitcase. It’s only 60F here today and the other wheels are fine. Guess I’ll have to see how the Samsonite warranty is…",2023-01-05
"Sturdy, functional, missing padlock information Let's start with the negative: the padlock is simple and effective, but the suitcase arrived from Amazon with zero packaging instructions for how to operate the lock and it took a lot of frantic YouTubing at the eleventh hour to find directions. I bought this checked size case for a two-week trip to Italy and discovered that I am not a fan of the clamshell style after all. If you use packing cubes, this will be not be as much of a problem, but things slide around and fall out easily if you have to open and close the case multiple times. With a smaller suitcase this might not be a big issue, but with. larger one it's just cumbersome. That's just my preference. The white color was on sale presumably because it will get filthy, but it's easy to spot on the carousel! Overall, it's lightweight, wonderfully maneuverable, and just fine, but I docked it a star for the missing lock info.",2023-01-05
