"March 17, 2025","I decided to purchase a Stanley cup and I have made the best choice. They have so many colors, different styles and sizes to choose from.What stands out the MOST is its impressive insulation. It keeps my water ice cold for hours which it can last a day. The handle is sturdy and is a great addition to the cup. The handle makes it easy and super convenient to carry around. I’ve had zero issues with leaks. I’ve purchased the little leak proof accessories to aid in cases I accidentally tip it over.The large capacity is a game-changer; I no longer need constant refills. If you’re looking for a durable, high-quality tumbler and one that’s looks stylish this is the one. I highly recommend this brand. You won’t regret your purchase."
"March 16, 2025","the Stanley  (30 oz) has quickly become my go-to for staying hydrated throughout the day. The 30 oz capacity is just right, offering plenty of space for water, coffee, or any drink of choice. The handle is super convenient for carrying, and the straw makes sipping easy, especially while driving or at work. The insulation works wonderfully—my drinks stay cold for hours. It's durable, well-built, and fits perfectly in most car cup holders. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a practical, stylish, and reliable tumbler!"
"March 16, 2025","Gave as a gift! Worth the hype, quality is superb! Easy to travel mug, color as described, easy to clean, can keep water cool or warm up to described length of hours."
"March 16, 2025","I recently bought me and my siblings matching Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumblers (30 oz) in Lilac, and I’m loving it! The tumbler is super cute and not too heavy, making it comfortable to carry around. One of the best things about it is that it keeps your liquid at whatever temperature you put it in, whether it’s cold or hot. I love that the ice lasts for a long time inside, which is a huge plus!I don’t use mine as much, but my sister lives for hers—she carries it around 24/7. The 3-way twist-on lid is convenient, and the design is cupholder compatible, making it perfect for on-the-go. Plus, it's BPA-free and made with insulated stainless steel, so it’s super durable."
"March 16, 2025","It holds its temperature VERRY well, a little bit too well, if you fill it up with ice and put a fridge chilled drink into so your sodas, and your juices it will turn almost so a slushy. Sometimes the lid is hard to take off but if you kinda gently bang the lid on the counter or something it will usually make it a little easier to take off the lid. I use this while I'm trucking and the size is great for sitting in the cup holder.It's a nice simple look on it. Adequate liquid flow in the straw so you don't have to suck on the straw hard at all. It is nice to hold in your hand. I put my cup and straw into the dishwasher and it cleans pretty good but maybe clean the straw separately so the soapy taste doesn't stay for long. When I use this cup, I stay hydrated pretty easily and can measure how much liquid I drink a day"
"March 15, 2025","I love my Stanley! I'll admit, I jumped on the Stanley bandwagon but I am not looking back and will buy another in a different color eventually - they are pricy after all. They aren't leak proof at all so be careful about it tipping over. However, they do make lids that are leak proof so you can always order one of those as well. I have had mine for several months now and it's held up nicely. It's nice and comfortable to hold and truly keeps my drinks ice cold for hours, even overnight. If you're looking for a cute and trendy tumbler, get your hands on a Stanley."
"March 15, 2025","My daughter had her eye on a Stanley for about a year. She worked hard and it was a reward for good grades. We’ve had knockoff cups but this is worth it in my book. The color is just what she wanted, the pieces all come apart to make cleaning easier and it keeps water cold for long periods of time. She takes it to sports or whenever she is on the go. She loves it so much I bought my own."

"March 14, 2025","This is thee cutest yet functional think I've bought in forever. The cup holds 40 oz of water and it does keep my ice cold for 2 days. I use it everyday as I am a water loving goddess. The size is perfect for helping me quickly drink my 1 gallon of water a day. I like that the cup has the no slip grip on the handle which makes it easier and comfortable to carry all the places I carry it. It's very satisfying for me to take the cup apart once a week to deep clean it and it's very easy to take apart clean it and put it back together. I even purchased a cute star shaped ice tray for the cup. I came in perfect condition even though Amazon ships then without a box mine for here unscathed, and I dropped it once and nothing happened no dent and no paint chipped off nothing. They are highly customizable and I already know what the next color I want to order. I can say that the cup can get heavy when filled with water and ice but it's not unbearable. The pink is that girly baby pink you see in your cotton candy dreams. I would definitely order this one again and I'm a Stanley girl now."
"March 14, 2025","I reviewed their Captain's Coffee Mug previously.  Prior to that, I purchased this HUGE mug for long trips, workouts, basically anywhere I need water or a sports drink to keep me hydrated.  I mean look at this mug!  It's solid and top quality, heavy duty yet I have no issues toting it.  You can clean it easily as the top is a wide opening.  If you accidentally tip it on its side, which is practically impossible, only the straw will leak liquid and usually you can right it before that happens.  It is well-balanced and keeps contents really cold (for a couple days even) or I suppose hot, although I use my Stanley Captain's mug for that.  Maybe you've heard some folks say that the Stanley mugs aren't cheap... well yeah, reliability and quality that perform and last are priced accordingly, but I consider these an investment in a solid product I will be using for a long time to come."
"March 14, 2025","There are a lot of types of products we don’t order off of Amazon because they are fake or not great products in our personal experience. I saw this Stanley cup in pink (which I’ve looked for for 2 years & never have seen it in stock) & it was also on sale when I got it so I thought it was probably a fake one or had a defect, but to my surprise it’s a real Stanley & it’s so much cheaper than the ones my sister got my nieces for Christmas in the same color… it was almost half of what she paid. Love the color & the cup!! A great addition to my Stanley addiction cup collection!! Love this item & finally a pink one! Def. suggest ordering from this seller for good colors & sales!!"
"March 14, 2025","I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups, I always thought they were overpriced and over hyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast. Super happy!"
"March 14, 2025","When I used to workout, I saw many people carrying around these Casks (for want of a better word) at the club, and constantly addressing ongoing thirst. I wasn't interested at first, too bulky for me. Then I got this one for Christmas, and my viewpoint changed. Fill it halfway with ice, and the beverage you add will remain ice cold for longer than a day. Even better, the ice cubes inside will take a long time, and I mean a long time to melt. The container when filled can be a little heavy because of the size, ounces it holds, and the fact that the container is made of metal. It'll take some serious effort to break this thing, so don't worry that you have to handle it with kid gloves. Lastly, this is a Stanley product. Quality and value are attached to this brand. Sure there are cheaper products, but constantly replacing always ends up far more costlier. Good Luck, Happy Drinking"
"March 13, 2025","I love my Stanley! I bought this for the gym because I got tired of breaking my glass water bottles. This holds about 4 16oz bottles of water. It is solid and leak proof. I’ve had this for about 5 months now and I use it every single day. No issues! It is easy to clean and it looks just like the picture. I love this tumbler. I haven’t used it for coffee or any hot beverages because it’s just a workout water bottle for me, but the quality is top tier!  I just wish the straw was a bit longer though."
"March 13, 2025","My granddaughter always wanted a Stanley Cup. I purchased this pink cup for her. It was exactly how I saw it on the website big enough to hold water for her all day. Kept her drinks cold while she was in school. Only thing is that when the drop the cup the liquids will spill out. This stanley cup however, is not leak proof but it’s still a great cup."
"March 13, 2025",Bought this for my sister and she loved it for her birthday. She tells me the handle is super convenient. Also it keeps it super cold and hot for a long time which is great for traveling and keeping in the car. Also not plastic which is a plus so sun damage won’t release any micronanoplastics into your water. Always against plastic and go for glass or like this steel.
"March 13, 2025","I love my Stanley cup!It keeps everything cool and hot if that’s what you look into.It’s leak proof and very easy to clean.This cup is just the right size to fit into my car cup holder. ( which is awesome since most cups don’t fit )Though a bit on the costly side, but I’m happy with my purchase."
"March 13, 2025","I love love this Stanley. This is my 3rd one and my favorite one! Pink is my favorite color. I can't say much about keeping drinks hot because I only use it for water. I only drink water with water packets. But I can say it keeps it cold. I'd recommend using extra ice though. If you don't put enough in, it will melt quickly. I also love how easy Stanley's are to clean! Super cute and great quality :)"
"March 13, 2025","My goal is to drink 60 oz of water a day and I've used the iron flask and the Stanley I much prefer the Stanley.in order to meet my goal of 60 oz I have to refill my tumbler three times a day so turning the lid is important it has to be easy with the iron flask it took 5 turns. the Stanley takes 3 turns to open and close the lids. I don't like the pop-off lids because it hurts my thumb and having to do this three times a day is not fun.  All those seals are waterproof.Water mixed with 5 drops of Cassia oil gives sweet cinnamonny taste to water. In the Iron Flask Tumbler, with the casia oil mixed with water I can taste a metal taste. The Stanley tumbler, I taste this sweet taste of casia oil and water, there's no metalic after taste."
"March 13, 2025","I have the 40oz already and it works great but sometimes I just want something smaller to tote around and the 20oz is perfect! Fits just enough water for quick trips around town or at home. Its small size makes it easier to carry into church, etc. Especially glad it has a handle. A small one, but it works!"
"March 13, 2025","Absolutely love my Stanley water bottle! The quality is top-notch—durable, well-insulated, and keeps my water cold for hours. The design is sleek and easy to carry, plus the handle makes it super convenient on the go. The lid is leak-proof, and the straw makes sipping effortless"
"March 13, 2025","This Stanley cup is fantastic! I bought it as a birthday gift for my partner, and he’s inseparable from it—it’s always in his hands. It’s easy to see why Stanley dominates the market with their cups; the quality and appeal are undeniable. I’m already looking forward to purchasing more from them in the future!"
"March 13, 2025","I absolutely love the pomelo color. I was wanting a Stanley and the 30 oz was the perfect size. I love that it fits in my car cup holders. I carry this cup everywhere. It keeps my drinks cold all day, it’s easy to clean, and great quality!"
"March 13, 2025","Will fit in car cup holder BUT if go around corner fast it will FALL OVER, & leak out.  I like really cold water, use  2 BIG ice cubes, around 3-4  acrylic ice cubes plus small cubes from refrigerator ice maker; for 30 oz size..  Sometimes add more water after a few hours."
"March 13, 2025","This is my second Stanley cup, and I got this one specifically for work—absolutely love it! It keeps my drinks cold all day, is super durable, and the handle makes it easy to carry around. The size is perfect for staying hydrated without constant refills. If you’re on the fence, just get it—you won’t regret it!"
"March 13, 2025","This cup is super easy to clean and does not leak, especially when dropped. It keeps coffee at a perfect temperature to drink and keeps it warm for a long time. It is very durable and sturdy. The color is a perfect white."
"March 13, 2025","it's very nice i liked it a lot but sadly some dirty person stole it bc their broke but it's nice and it's true to its look, it keep your water cold for the full day and the next day ice was still in mines and cold it's really nice just dont leave it bc dirty ppl exist"
"March 13, 2025","This product is very good overall. The color is gorgeous, and drinking from the straw is super easy. Plus, cleaning the straw is a breeze.It does an amazing job at keeping my cold drinks at the same temperature all day, even without ice cubes. I definitely recommend it!"
"March 13, 2025","Absolutely love my Stanley cup! It keeps my drinks cold for hours, and the design is super durable. The color is gorgeous—vibrant yet elegant, making it stand out in the best way. Perfect for everyday use and easy of clean."
"March 13, 2025","The color is so much prettier than expected and it came on time. My only problem was that it came with a little scratch on the bottom and with the straw already in the cup, which i have never experienced before when ordering a stanley. The scratch is barely noticeable so i’m not too worried on that. Other than that, was worth it!"
"March 13, 2025","Very pleased even though I ordered and paid for 30oz they sent a 40oz. They’re loss my gain, but I love it. Holds ice for almost 2 days! Love the color and quality. And I also bought some dressing for it! Cute little straw cover and skirt!"
"March 13, 2025","Ok, but can this color be any cuter?! I love how it brightens my day every time I look at it— cleaning is a breeze, make sure you take the full cup apart as mold can build up."
"March 13, 2025","Almost immediately the handle completely broke off. I contacted Stanley, sent them a few pictures and received a new cup relatively quickly. Despite the cup breaking, it was a positive experience because of how quickly it was replaced."
"March 13, 2025","So cute! It's bigger than you think and the quality is great even after being dropped a couple times lol. It's meant for cold drinks, so if I want it for tea or coffee then I wouldn't get it. But it keeps your water so nice and cold for hours. It will leak if dropped, not leak proof."
"March 13, 2025","I used it for about 10 months since last March. One day, the part below the handle came off, and a few days later, the handle completely detached. I tried fixing it with epoxy, but it didn’t work. Luckily, it was covered under warranty. After contacting Stanley, I received a new bottle within a week. However, they mentioned that the exact same color wasn’t available, so they sent a similar one. Still, I’m satisfied!"
"March 13, 2025","Nice cup, keeps my drink cold for hours, only leaks when you turn it over. Fits in car cup holders, and easy to carry around. Cleaning it is super easy too! Perfect for any kind of use."
"March 12, 2025","I ordered the blue 30 oz and got a beautiful dark red 40 oz. Thank you for the upgrade 😁 I love my Stanley's. I have ordered several and will buy more for gifts. These are well worth the money, the quality is outstanding, I love every color I have gotten and cannot wait to see what colors you come up with next. Only problem I have had is that the classic trigger action ones take forever to be shipped. Otherwise amazing products."
"March 12, 2025","I absolutely LOVE! Such a beautiful color! And for the price! I love that I can easily hold it and sip it while driving, my only complaint is that it is not secure in my cup holder in my car. Easy to take apart to clean, the size is perfect for my morning coffee!!"
"March 12, 2025",Best cup ever. Keeps ice in it for about two days . I left my cup in my car full of ice in the summer and the ice was still in there 8 hours later .
"March 12, 2025","The Stanley mug keeps drinks perfectly hot or cold for hours! Its rugged build feels incredibly durable and reliable. I love the comfortable handle and spill-proof lid. Simply put, it's the best mug I've ever owned."
"March 12, 2025",Gave this to my husband for Xmas… really nice & sturdy.  It holds like 42 oz. & he is a huge water drinker.  Keeps the beverage cold.. ice does not melt easily.  Definitely a good purchase.
"March 12, 2025","First Impressions:I was so excited to get this Stanley tumbler, but I was disappointed with how easily it scuffs. While I understand that shipping conditions aren’t in the company’s control (it arrived in a paper envelope and got banged up), I did expect it to be more durable. For a tumbler known for its toughness, I was surprised at how quickly it showed wear.🎯 Product Features & Performance:The color is absolutely beautiful, and the insulation is amazing—it kept ice frozen for two full days! That’s exactly what I was hoping for. However, one downside is that it leaks easily—even when slightly tipped. I wasn’t expecting it to be completely spill-proof, but I did think it would be a little more secure.✅ Pros & Cons:✔ Gorgeous color – looks just like the listing✔ Keeps drinks ice cold for days – excellent insulation✔ Comfortable to hold and use❌ Leaks easily – even when slightly tilted❌ Scratches and scuffs too easily – not as durable as expected🛠 Who This Product Is Best For:If you’re looking for a tumbler that keeps drinks cold for days, this one does an amazing job. However, if you want something that holds up well to daily use without showing wear too quickly, you might want to keep that in mind before purchasing.💡 Final Thoughts – Would I Buy Again?I love how well it keeps drinks cold, but I do wish it was a little more durable and resistant to wear. While it serves its purpose, I was hoping for a bit more toughness from Stanley."
"March 12, 2025","Use it every single day. I don't think I drink water in anything else now. My ice stays cold and I don't have to worry about spillage with this barely at all, and I'm clumsy!"
"March 11, 2025",I love love loveee my Stanley! It keeps all my drinks cold for a long time. It’s easy to clean and the stainless steel is perfect. The color was the exact same as the pictures. Only giving 4/5 stars due to the cup not being leak proof. I wish I was aware of that.
"March 11, 2025",First of all I amObsessed with my Stanley cup it’s the best ever and it really keep things super cold or warm but but buy
"March 11, 2025","I thought it was a scam, it was a actually real!!! Except mines didnt come in a box, thankfully it wasnt damaged, 5/5 stars!"
"March 11, 2025","I was very skeptical of purchasing a Stanley tumbler, despite the craze to buy one and the overwhelmingly positive reviews; I remained skeptical and was put off by the elevated price.  I have severe gastrointestinal issues and if something isn’t prepared correctly or isn’t at the right temperature, I’m going to suffer. Roughly 2 days before I purchased this tumbler, I had made a smoothie placed it in a non-Stanley insulated tumbler, and took it to work.  Two hours later, I had my smoothie, and 30 minutes after finishing it, I was in severe abdominal pain that was so bad that I had to go home early.  Since I’ve had my Stanley tumbler, I haven’t had this issue.  My smoothie is cold when it goes in the tumbler, and 2-3 hours later it’s still just as cold as when it was first made. Although this item was a bit pricey, it was well worth it for me."
"March 10, 2025",I brought this to work and the same morning a coworker commented how she liked it. The color is amazing (I got ' indigo').  I particularly like 2 things about these Stanley mugs over other mugs.  One is the top screws on unlike other brands that just push on.  That's important to me if I tip it I know the top will stay on.  Also I drink HOT tea and the top allows a bit to come out and cool on its way to my lips. Other brands you tilt it and WHAM your lips get scalding water without warning. This top is designed well so that doesn't happen.  Overall I'm a fan of the 20oz tumblers without the handles.  Not sure why anyone needs a handle because the mug is cool to the touch no matter how hot the insides are.  Just sayin'

"March 9, 2025",I love my Stanley! The color was a perfect fit for me. It is not leak proof so you have to be careful. It will make a great addition to a gift set for birthdays and celebrations. I have banged it against things (not on purpose obviously) and it has held up well.
"March 9, 2025",Bought this for a friend and she is absolutely in love with it so much easier to use than a 40 oz. So much easier to lift once it's filled. The color is beautiful too
"March 8, 2025","The Stanley Quencher 30 oz cup is a game-changer! The sleek design is both stylish and practical, and I get tons of compliments on it. It's durable, eco-friendly, and perfect for staying hydrated all day. Highly recommend!"
"March 8, 2025",This was a last minute gift. Super convenient that I was able to purchase here. I own quite a few and the quickness of delivery is always a plus!!! Best of the best!
"March 8, 2025",Really like this 40oz Stanley Cup. It keeps the water cold and ice does not melt for at a minimum 24 hours. Keeping it filled reminds me to keep drinking water to stay hydrated.
"March 8, 2025","Got this cup for my husband for Father’s Day. He travels a lot and I wanted him to have a cup to take along with him that would keep his drinks at the temp he wants. No complaints other than how it was delivered. It didn’t come in the Stanley box/packaging. Just in a paper bag and no bubble wrap. It was scratched up a bit, but luckily my husband isn’t picky and didn’t mind it enough to send it back. Overall great product other than it not being leak proof. Don’t tip it over while full. It will spill."
"March 8, 2025","I am a water bottle brat. I have used several different water bottles and I have found several I love, but none of them can even compare to my Stanley! It has a long ice retention and it has also kept the temperature of my hot coffee perfect! I live on a farm and I have two younger kids so we are always going and moving. I can't count the number of times I have dropped this poor cup, even though it is easy to carry, and it is extremely scratch resistant and dent resistant. This Stanley has been an amazing value for the money."
"March 7, 2025",My husband loves his new Stanley. The color is a dark Hunter green with a dark lid. Fits easily into most cup holders (almost all car cup holders). 10/10. Would recommend.
"March 6, 2025","Love, love, love this thing. The 30 oz. size should be the standard Stanley cup, because honestly the 40 ounces one is just so dang heavy when it's full. Honestly, I have that size for work, because I can't refill it all day like when I'm home. But for the weekend, and on the go- this is the perfect size and I LOVE this color because not a lot of people seem to have it, and that makes me happy...lol"
"March 6, 2025","So far this tumbler is working very well. I would have given it 5 stars, but I have difficulty opening and closing the lid. My drinks do stay cold, and the ice lasts all night long. The purple color is nice. The cup fits my car cupholder perfectly."
"March 5, 2025","The Stanley Tumbler is hands down the best drinkware I’ve ever used. I take it everywhere—work, road trips, and the gym—and it keeps my drinks at the perfect temperature for HOURS."
"March 5, 2025","I bought this cup since I trust STANLEY. It is well made from recycled 18/8 Stainless Steel. It is supposed to be spill-proof, and it is with the straw in if it falls over to the right, less if to the left.  It leaks worse when “closed” .  I have told STANLEY about this and how to fix it  and just maybe will fix this. I hope so!  Even with the straw in, my hot tea was hot for several hours  I really love it!"
"March 3, 2025","Bought this for my wife and she loves it!  Just as good as the ""other brands"", and she loves the straw.  The OG in these types of drinkware!"
"March 2, 2025","Bought it as a gift, so far the cup holds up with no mold even when purchased from the time it was recalled so some bad factories as normal"
"March 2, 2025","The best cup for my massive smoothies, thank you Stanley for making this cup. I love it so much and recommend to anyone. It’s not just trendy. It’s actually amazing."
"March 2, 2025",I love this mug. I use it everyday for ice water. At the end of the day it still has ice even after being refilled with water several times.
"March 1, 2025",I have had this tumblr for three months now. It is the best one I’ve ever had. Keeps ice in it for days so I think you would love it.
"March 1, 2025","I am very satisfied with my cup. The size is pleasing, the cup is obviously real, and the grip is comfortable. Yes, they do leak. But there are solutions to it: Purchase leak stoppers of the right size and type for you cup. They're avaliable on here, bought them before. No issues with the cup, just please don't be rough with it. The appearance is dazzling."
"February 28, 2025","This cup did not arrive in a box which I find strange, so I do not know if it’s been used or is new. As a senior citizen with COPD I take my health extra serious. This was purchased because I’ll be traveling and needed one for my car. Now I have to sanitize it before I leave."
"February 27, 2025","Very noice! :) I loved it, i got it like a year ago (ish) but I still like it. It works fine, has nice stuff, was accurate to what it showed. The packaging on the little thing where it shows the name was a little sticky though. But still very easy to fix!. It’s good to put drinks it, no leaks, comfortable to carry like any other cup its size or any size! Just not light, but still fine to carry. Also one time I was drinking out of it and I left it, it kept the drink (water) cold for 8 HOURS?! Fav cup and it’s no.2 in favs. All most very much grateful package. Arrived like 3hrs early :3"
"February 27, 2025","Perfect, but I would say that the 40oz is super large. So if you buy this size then you should make sure you know how big it is."
"February 26, 2025",My 5 yr old granddaughter wanted a Stanley ! lol.I ordered it. It’s a pretty pink. Got the small one and the handle works great for her
"February 25, 2025","Best tumble I've found for coffee. It'll fit in every cup holder I got, has a screw on lid and won't leak coffee every where if it falls over."
"February 24, 2025",This was the best Stanley I have purchases. IT's taken a couple of tumbles and  has been very durable. Keeps my water cold all day long!
"February 22, 2025","Anyone who has a daughter knows that a Stanley water bottle is the ""it"" container for fluids. This is stylish and the color is beautiful. The handle is convenient for carrying. The style allows for customization with a fun straw color cover. Drinks stay cold for hours. The top does leak. Leaks through straw without separate cover and leaks through the piece that holds the straw. Assembly and disassembly for dishwashing is easy and all pieces are dishwasher safe. Screw top is also very easy to open. Expensive, but in line with name brand metal water bottles. Drinks taste crisp and cold."
"February 20, 2025",This is a great Tumbler that I use frequently and is great at keeping my drink ice cold.  I love the color and get compliments often.
"February 17, 2025","Bought this for my daughter as a ten year olds birthday request. She wanted pink or purple in 32 or 40oz that’s it but being me, I figure she needed some stuff to go with it 😆! It was $45 for the 40oz Peony Pink color. I thought the lilac was also gorgeous but this pink stood out so strongly and in stores they only carry the hot pink 40oz that has an orange logo on it. I don’t think it’s as attractive as the one o bought and I don’t think she enjoys orange either. It’s sturdy and sleek and comfortable in the hands. The screws were standing out so heavily as fine quality upon notice. No scratches or scuff. Super clean. No Oder!!! Thank God!!! I hate strong oders. It does have gaps where you can easily see it’ll leak if it’s full and you tip it over but being the dad that I am i bought the stoppers as well and they fit so snug. Could still leak but it’s not supposed to be upside down so like… who cares? And seriously you really have to work hard at getting it in a position that causes it to leak. The stoppers I bought for snuggly so I’m very satisfied with the leak stoppers I bought on Amazon, I left a video of the before and after installing them in the other sellers review section. I would know how to link this one to that one but hope you find it and that it helps. But if you don’t buy the stoppers, Honestly get over it nothing is literally perfect except Jesus so just enjoy the cup, it’s phenomenal even without the stoppers. The stainless steel or titanium is what it actually looks like is superb by the look and the feel!!!  The pink paint is gorgeous!!! Taylor Swift probably made that song about this Stanley 🤷🏾‍♂️ I seriously wouldn’t be surprised. I have no cons for you honestly. It’s a wonderful buy and I get it now why she wanted one and why my girl friend also desires a Stanley. I really questioned why that brand of all brands like it’s just a cup, like it’s not that serious?! 🧐 but low and behold! Boy! It is that serious and for the price amazing and again, I could not find this color anywhere in the real world. So thanks Amazon! Thanks to the seller and thank you Jesus we have the internet and apps that make life easier for everyday day citizens like you dear reader who took the time out to read my long winded commentaries 😂. Hope this and the pics and videos help you making your decision. I’m fully intending to buy one for myself in some bold manly color if I can find one.If your worried if it’s fake or not, you can compare them to the others online:#1 Screws are located underneath the handle and are aligned well. Using the same metal as the inside of the drinking canister which is really think is titanium and not stainless steel actually. Because it’s definitely superior grade quality. Trust me you’ll know the difference looking inside it 😆#2 the straw comes in the cup already with no separate packaging and is the same semi-cloudy tone as the upper lip of the cup and is not totally transparent or translucent.#3 the inner canister of the metal bottom will have an etched in recycled sign at the very bottom.#4 the Lion logo on bottom of cup.#5 the Lion logo on upper half of the cup will be about an inch or so from the lip of the cup while a fake will be two to three inches lower, much further from the lip of the cup.#6 the top of the cup handle will be super close to the top of the stainless steel part while a fake will be noticeably further from the top of the top (like inches or so away from the lip of the cup).So this one is real! And I highly recommend it!"
"February 15, 2025","Absolutely, amazing! I put it through two tests already and I love it it!So far, so good. It seems to be standing up to its buyer standards."
"February 15, 2025","I really like my new Stanley (my first!) Cold drinks stay cold forever - I’ve not tried hot drinks.  The lids can be hard to remove if you tighten them too much (or don’t have strong hands), and they will leak and make a small mess if you knock them over. And honestly, they’re a little heavy, haha! But the bottom line is that they’re worth it. They’re good cups. I can put it in the dishwasher, the lid parts come apart to clean it well, it’s just a good cup. I strongly recommend. :)"
"February 14, 2025","Its very cute! very light, and it keeps my drinks cold, definitely worth it! i recommend handwashing instead of putting it in the dishwasher. Good quality"
"February 14, 2025","I wanted a reliable insurlated tumber when I'm on the go! My great niece( a teen no doubt) told the the Stanly Quecher was all the rage now and I shoud ""get with it"".( I had an old time plastic one. Well, I I live the weather was 24 degrees when a friend and I ventured out to run some errands. I packed my Stanley Quencer with green tea and lemon. My friend had a different type.  After three hours we went to sit down in a shopping  mall.She opened her tea and found lukewarm. I put the insulated straw in my Stanley Quencher and tea was still hot, not steaming but a pleasurable tempature to drink. I', ordering one for my friend. Suffice it to say, my teen age niece was pleased when she saw tumbeler on the kitchen table ! I highly recommended this product and they come in beautiful colors, but be conservative I like the black.!"
"February 12, 2025","I bought this bottle because it keeps the water cold along the day, the water fresh and cold the whole day!!! Wow that’s wonderful!!Besides, I decided to change any throw away all my plastics bottles to the recycle container!! Now a day nothing plastic in my body, nor in my water on a daily basis!!"
"February 12, 2025",Beautiful color every day cup! Easy to wash and very sturdy exterior. Even fell off counter from a naughty cat and it did not dent!
"February 12, 2025",Love it keep my drink cold and great for traveling love the colors and it’s easy to clean last all day with water and other drinks
"February 11, 2025","Nothing much to say, scratch resistant, has a lifetime warranty, leak proof, just what you pay for and the price was in my budget"
"February 10, 2025",It would been nice for it to come in a box not just the bag it was a gift. Other then that was nice
"February 9, 2025","I got my self sucked in on buying a tumbler, even though I have other brands. No regret It’s cute and steady. I will be using it on my trips to Pilates class."
"February 8, 2025","I have a question. Was there to be some kind of a cap on the straw part? Everyone seems to think so, yet there was no cap for the straw on the Stanley that I received."
"February 2, 2025",I love this cup.The Rose Quartz color is very pretty. It isn’t spill proof so I bought the accessories to add to it. I use the big ice molds & 3 of the last til the next day in this cup.
"January 30, 2025","What can I say, these Stanley 40oz numbers are the best. Keep everything cold, easy to use, keeps coffee hot, doesn't leak and great quality."
"January 26, 2025","Was debating on this purchase as well as the color, and I must say that I am thrilled that I finally purchased this Stanley. Pairs with every bag and outfit that I have, which is a nice plus. Not too heavy yet it feels well made and durable. Love the size and the fact that the tumbler itself isn’t too bulky. Definitely recommend purchasing in some of the darker colors and the Stanley products as well, they are worth the hype and popular for a reason! Love the fact that the lid is so easy to open versus the Yeti where you have to pull the lid out to refill. Stays cold even with little ice and the design again fits easily into my tote bag and my center console. I would only drink water or something similar versus a thicker beverage or a hot coffee, doubtful it would be a problem just a thought! Love love this tumbler!"
"January 25, 2025",My 7 yr old granddaughter had to have a Stanley like grandmas. Said she wanted the same one but in blue. She was so excited & happy when she opened that present. Keeps drink cold forever.
"January 25, 2025",My daughter loved it. I got the used like new and there was a small black scuff or two that came off with magic eraser!
"January 16, 2025",This attractive cup keeps its contents at the desired temperature and does not leak. It is well made and easy to use and wash. I recommend this cup.
"January 10, 2025",I love the color it so pretty . And the ice temperature I woke up and my ice is still cold I love it . Thank you so much Stanley and I don’t drink enough water so this definitely will motivate me to do so 🥰🥰
"January 6, 2025","I love Stanley’s they are easy to use and don’t break easily. I love how they how a handle, it makes it easier to use. It will hold ice all day before melting. The design is very cute, and I love the color. It’s very easy to drink and is easy to clean. Definitely Recommend!"
"January 5, 2025","Bought this for my friend birthday gift. She loves it! It has a little bit weight, but with good quality and easy to clean."
"June 29, 2024","I purchased it as a gift for a White Elephant party at work, and everyone was fighting for it! The color is very nice."
