" affordable quality I am a very careful and price wary shopper. We don't have kids in the home but we use wipes. Most companies now offer ""personal wipes"" that are super expensive. Baby wipes are the same thing for much less! Our city has old outdated sewers and we do not use paper at all. Having baby wipes is the best way for us. I usually buy Huggies wipes in warehouse stores but Amazon has a great price on a case at a time so I set up a subscribe and save on them. Huggies are soft, very lightly scented and are the right size and protection. I think they are the best wipe out there! I highly recommend this well made soft baby wipe for any person or family.",2023-01-01
"Good value but not for sensitive skin. Wish it was JUST WATER! I liked these for a while because of the insane value but my babe started getting bad rashes recently anytime I use them. When I switch to M@ma Be@r water wipes, rashes heal quickly and don't recur... as those wipes are just water and are super soft. These are not soft, but are quite thick, so I dry them out and use them as dry wipes for absorbing purposes around the changing table instead. We went through a case with no issues before, but I guess I'll go back to the Water wipes to avoid rashes.",2023-01-01
 Great product Baby has sensitive skin. These wipes do not break her out like others have and that's such a relief,2023-01-01
 Great on baby skin Bought it for my friend gender reveal but i personally use it on my 1 year old that as eczema and it caused no irritation,2023-01-01
"My favorite wipes! I love these wipes for my 5 month old son & my 2 year old niece. I love the easy large flip top, and that these are unscented. Aside from diapering usage I find these great to quickly clean my baby brezza formula pro formula dispenser, the funnel and dispensing hole need to be cleaned every 4 bottles and these wipes are such a life saver to use to wipe the dirty parts clean!",2023-01-01
 Softness Great for smooth comfortable feel on your butt. Definitely soft and really keep the bottom nice smooth and clear.,2023-01-01

 Most useful recommend for babies and anyone else who needs these. They are large and firm enough.,2023-01-03
Won't buy anything else! Keep going back to this Brand! It's perfect and wipes are soft and always wet and don't dry out that fast! Sensitive is the only one I will use and this price is still cheaper than in stores. It always arrives early. We use a wipe warmer so the Individual packs are great sizes!,2023-01-03
 Dry Those wipes are little dry,2023-01-03
 Baby Wipes GREAT wipes for babies and adults.,2023-01-03
 Bulk wipes for decent price We use wipes alot in our house my 4yr old uses them sometimes when wiping after using the bather I also use them to clean her face and we put a lot up for when we have our 3rd baby in April. If you want to bulk buy wipes to stock up this is the way to go,2023-01-03
 As expected Quality is as expected. I enjoy the subscription so I don't have to worry about finding them in stores.,2023-01-03

 good good,2023-01-03
"Great Deal!!! These are a common staple in our bathroom. We're adults, and it's nice to be fresh… always. These are thick and have no scent at all!! That's important too. Don't use pampers wipes… they burn like fire!! No wonder babies cry. Use Huggies, and in bulk is the way to do it!",2023-01-03
" Packed with moisture I love these wipes. They're the only ones I have found that maintain moisture that you can actually see on the wipe. It's nice because then you can use minimal. There is no scent to them. The only thing is that it holds so much water that sometimes trying to get them out of the pack, they tear and you have to fish the rest of it out. Not a big deal to me though, I'll continue buying these.",2023-01-03
 Soft cleanser I love these wipes. It wipes out all dirty and stain on baby body. The scent is very comfortable,2023-01-03
Tend To Tear I wanted to love these wipes. The positives are that they are fabulous for sensitive skin and are soft and thick. Unfortunately they tend to tear when pulling them out of the pack. I've had to resort to taking the few out that I need unfolded. This works but makes more work for me. So I'm of two opinions here or I would have given five stars. Maybe I'm just clumsy and you'll have better luck. This is a good value and Huggies is a champ when it comes to wipes.,2023-01-03
 Good deal 11 big packs of wipes for cheap,2023-01-03

 Great value and high quality! These wipes are perfect for everyday use. I always have a set of wipes in the common areas and in all of the bathrooms. I love how they don't have a scent and they are priced really well!,2023-01-03
 Wipes Love huggies wipes,2023-01-03
 HUGGIES ALL GOOD THE ONLY BRAND I USE,2023-01-04
" Can be obnoxious to use. They're wipes. They work fine as wipes. No purfume and they haven't bothered my daughter's skin. The ""obnoxious"" part is they constantly only give you one wipe without lifting the next wipe in the stack. This is extremely annoying when you're using one hand to hold the baby's butt in the air and only have one hand free to try and get another wipe out without grabbing 3. Why can't wipes makers find the balance between this and getting a nonstop string of wipes?",2023-01-04
Durability and softness Love the thickness,2023-01-04
" Great for Use on Horses I use these to wipe my horses eyes, injuries and private parts and the wipes work great. They don't irritate the skin and they are unscented which is perfect for horses and babies!",2023-01-04
" Durable, soft, and unscented. The Huggies Fragrance-Free baby wipes are durable and soft. They work perfectly every time with no ripping or excess mess.",2023-01-04
"Great for sensitive skin My almost 2.5 year old has very sensitive skin- these were/are a lifesaver for his little butt. The thickness is perfect (I HATE thin babywipes) and they are just the right amount of wetness. (Not to dry/not to wet). He is now potty trained but still poops In his underwear:( so we still use these wipes for cleaning up his butt. I also used them up until a month or so ago on my daycare kiddos (along with my 2.5 year old) for their face, hands, legs, feet etc (MULTIPLE wipes a day).I am auto subscribed every 2 months and would have 1 or 2 packages when the new box would be delivered.I however have been switching my home to chemical free products and have Got a few body cloths (reusable+machine washable) through my online business so I'm not having to use the wipes to clean off their legs, face, feet, etc anymore- which is also helping on waste.I will probably be able to switch my subscription to every 6 months now :) I am working on my last thing of wipes from my previous delivery. (Before I would have already started the new box).",2023-01-04
Great! These work great. I haven't had any issues with irritation or finding anything that wasn't supposed to be in the wipes. One box lasts me around 3 months. Overall would recommend.,2023-01-04
" Nice wipes at a reasonable price We have used these for all of our kids, one child was very sensitive to most other products. We also use these for general cleanup of messes as well.",2023-01-04
 Excellent product. It does the job and it's a good price.,2023-01-04
" Great price! Great wipes. This was a great deal on Huggies wipes. We use them all the time on the baby, plus for cleanups around the house and makeup removal.",2023-01-04
 Convenient and needed! I love having the option of no scent sometimes. My granddaughter has not shown any irritation or rashes using this brand. Thanks...,2023-01-04
"Great for faces! I no longer have babies, but I buy these for my face. They're great for a quick wipe before bed, after being in the yard, or mid-day refresh. The product does not contain any plastic fibers, which means they are basically water and cotton. When dry, they can be shredded and composted - most other wipes can't be composted. I have sensitive skin and have had less instances of clogged pores after using this. These are great for using at my desk, by the bedside, and even use them to wipe down the dogs after they come inside! Great to remove excess oil from skin, and I will continue to have these in my home for a long time!",2023-01-04
 Really thin Someone gifted us the Honest-brand wipes and it ruined all other wipes for us. Gave these a try but don't like how thin they are and they rip easily.,2023-01-04
"Something's different. Disappointed I have been buying this product for over a year now, approximately once every 2-3 months. This last box I ordered, something was different. They are very rough feeling on your skin and they smell like window cleaner even though they are supposed to be unscented. I'm not sure if they changed their product or if there is a bad batch, but the box, packaging and everything is the same, except for the texture and smell of the baby wipes themselves.",2023-01-04
" BEST QUALITY WIPES FOR PRICE Have been using these wipes since my kids were born. No complaints here. They're strong, durable and good for sensitive skin. I have a subscription for them as they're still good to have for the family to clean faces, hands and bottoms.",2023-01-04

Best value These baby wipes are the absolute best! They are strong and durable and are the best value I have found. They are good for sensitive skin,2023-01-05
" More economical than pet wipes... These are great for what I need them for. I have a kitten. He was a rescue and for as long as I've had him, despite antibiotics and other treatments, he has a crusty nose and eye every day. I needed something soft, unscented, affordable and thick enough that I didn't get stuff in my hands. This fit the bill. It may seem crazy to buy baby Wipes for a cat, but have you compared the cost of pet Wipes to these? 15 bucks for 704 Wipes. That means that if they don't dry out, and considering my own personal use of these in the car and on trips, I will probably not have to buy Wipes for at least a year. I was buying the little packs of 18 pet Wipes from Walmart for about three bucks every two weeks at least. Because they were so small, I sometimes had to use more than one. This was a great deal.",2023-01-05
Better and stronger These wipes are stronger and better than any other brand I've used.,2023-01-05
" Delivered fast Came quick, good price for the amount, though when you open the box, they had a spot for one more packet they could have put in and just made it a box of 12 instead of 11. I mean it is rather stupid to fill a box and leave one spot empty so it looks like one is missing just to keep it at 11. Just add the 12th one in and call it a day. An actual complete box. Price would be even better if they made it an even 12 for the box. But over all good deal, i just found that rather stupid when i opened the box and it was like well that is dumb.",2023-01-05

" Perfect Perfect, when you don't feel like going into the store",2023-01-05
Go To I've been using these wipes since my son was born and have never used anything else. It cleans well and it's very durable. And you can't beat the price,2023-01-05
 Dry Purchased 4 boxes in total. Each was dry when opened. Not completely dry but it was too dry to wipe a baby butt with and it was rough.,2023-01-05
"Work just fine! But if you look for softness try smith else. Revised in a few weeks: I added 2 more stars to this product, not because it became softer or thicker, but its durable and comparing price-quality - it works just fine! and if you don't rush they pull one after another also pretty good. I still believe its more for grown-ups. Initially: I was Very dissapointed. Its for grown-ups, because baby's butts wouldn't handle it. Im a mom of 20 month old twin-girls. Its very thin, very rough, and you will have to dig almost every other tissue, as they are not pulling one after another. I decided to save a few bucks, and regretted. (Better spend time and go for Kirkland tissues-price-wise and good quality, or spend an extra $$ for your baby's comfort). Will keep a full box for myself.(Lol! Good for hemorrhoids...)- still true.",2023-01-05
 Great Item as described,2023-01-05
" am satisfied as a whole. This is really good for the price. It's the cheapest and most reliable baby wipes I've ever bought. That's why I'm thinking of repurchasing it and recommend it. The reason I subtracted one star is that my baby's butt turns red when using wet wipes too much. I know it's because my baby's skin is sensitive, but I want even that to be solved.",2023-01-05
 The product is good but there were only ten in the box I liked the scent and softness,2023-01-05
"Wipes were good, box not so good These wipes are best I've found for ingredients for sensitive skin and for pulling out correctly. The wipes aren't soft though so I compensate by wiping softly. They aren't the strongest wipes either. I thought when I purchased the product it was reasonably priced. Both boxes it came in wasn't even sealed or even taped shut, so as to be open to spiders or germs or dirt etc, that is why the 3 star rating instead of five, hopefully that's not the norm. This is my experience with this product but may not be yours. Hope this helps",2023-01-05
 Thick wipes Glad someone can make a thick wipe. Some of them are horrible.,2023-01-05
" Small and thin. Go for bigger and slightly thicker wipes They're small. Bigger wipes like Huggies natural, pampers wipes. Rico wipes are bigger, thicker and cleans comfortably with fewer wipes",2023-01-05
"Can be difficult to separate wipes Overall great product. It's slightly annoying when one is stuck separating two wipes after working in attempt to only get one out. There's a strong dot of adhesive but let's be honest, just stick the other wipe back in the container until next time.",2023-01-05
" Great for your money This is a great buy money wise, but they are very moist. There are times I have to ring out the excess water before using",2023-01-05
 The more the merrier! You can never have enough wipes. My whole house uses them!,2023-01-05
" They are soft and get the job done! I get Fragrance-Free just in case my little guy gets a rash at any point. The wipes are soft, and the lid has never broken off (an issue I have had with other brands). So far very satisfied with this product.",2023-01-05
 Wipes Loving these wipes! They are wonderful in my daughters sensitive skin.,2023-01-05
"Best there is out there Huggies has and will always be my number one wipe. Make up, bathroom, spills, hands, face, animals, kids, adults and even counters or car seats. These are hands down the most Durable wipes I have ever tried and I have tried them all. Also they don't have a scent which I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE.",2023-01-05
 My Bum is happy I'm an adult woman who uses these after using the toilet. I feel super clean down there. I wish these were more moisturized like the pampers brand. I like how the wipes come out one at a time so I get the exact amount I want.,2023-01-05
 They work They worked,2023-01-05
" Huggie's baby wipes Best on the market, imo. I prefer the unscented.",2023-01-05
 Good alternative for the price when comparing These wipes are good when they are cheaper to others. They help do the job and have no scent. Might be but rough but cleans,2023-01-05
"Decent wipe Overall a pretty solid wipe. It was good at cleaning up the solids, but definitely could have been more moist. Baby had no bad reactions, but because it was a little on the dryer side I felt it was too rough if she did have any diaper rash. I did not finish the box and switched to the unscented Members Mark wipes which have been much better for my daughter.",2023-01-05
" An excellent value I have been using this brand since my now twelve year old was in diapers. I still keep these around in the bathroom, a pack in the car because you never know what might happen and a pack by the door for quick clean ups with my dogs.",2023-01-05
 No comments Baby wipes can't go wrong,2023-01-05

 My favorite It's so gentle for baby skin. And not to watery,2023-01-05
"Our Favorite Wipes to Use Huggies wipes are our favorite wipes to use in our house. They come out of the package easily with one hand. Everyone jokes that we only buy these wipes because of Mickey Mouse (we're a HUGE Disney family), but that isn't the case. We use fewer wipes in comparison to other brands. These wipes are good for the big messes and soft enough for cleaning baby's face after a fountain of spit up.",2023-01-05
 Only wipes we use! These don't irritate my sons sensitive skin and they work well.,2023-01-05
 Great Product N/A,2023-01-05
" As described I use wipes to clean my face at night before I sleep and after I wake up. I like these wipes because the way they're folded makes it easy to extract 1 wipe at a time, unlike some other wipes I've used that bunch together and you end up extracting more wipes than needed. I will definitely buy these again when needed.",2023-01-05
They have made the cloth size smaller. Quality has changed some. Size of sheet is definitely smaller and noticed that it is also not as thick as my last package that I'm still using up. I have 3 open in different locations. New shipment is of lesser quality. But still prefer this brand over the others out there.,2023-01-05
 This is the best price ever Nothing,2023-01-05
" Wet wet wipes Bought on sale for a good deal. They are very wet, and stick together more than the other brand we normally use. They are equally as gentle, which is great.",2023-01-05
 Very useful Bought these for my grand baby. They came very useful on my trip to Paris.,2023-01-05
 This was a gift. This was a gift. She loved all these.,2023-01-05
 Great wipes Good value. Huggies is only brand we get for granddaughter. These are soft and smell nice. Thick enough to get the job done right the first time!,2023-01-05
Best Brand of Wipes at a Great Price I learned a long time ago to buy wipes in bulk because they are a necessity in my household. I find this box with the 11 flip top packages to be the best bargain. Huggies is the only brand for us.,2023-01-05
 Awesome No rashes I really like them. There's other things I missed the return deadline for. I would have returned but not these. Good go baby & mommy,2023-01-05
" For everyone Love these wipes! Super soft when moist, a bit tough to use when dried up. Highly recommend not to leave the lid open after using them, it will dry up! Overall the only wipes I ever use!",2023-01-05
"No lint left behind This is the only wipes I will use. They have remained the same over time and when they did change them, they quickly went back to the old way. These do not leave lint on skin for Babies, Children or Adults. The thickness is perfect! Fingers do not poke through (a problem most wipes have, that is unacceptable for what they are intended for!). Bonus points because they are easy to tear apart, if you only need ½ a wipe! (Most usually shred and stretch when you try to rip it!) I and my Grandchildren have extremely sensitive skin and these do not cause any problems. Companies think its only the scent that bothers people ~ it is the materials they use that causes more problems. These are truly unscented, gentle BUT strong!",2023-01-05
 I use these for everything I have used these for decades for everything. They are THE BEST eye makeup removers.,2023-01-05
 Maybe not that good for sensitive skin I used them for my hands and they felt fine. But yesterday I wiped my face with it and I felt stung until now,2023-01-05
Easy to use Easy to use. I also keep them in my car for cleaning when needed.,2023-01-05
" The best wipes out there! I've used a lot of different wipes over the years with three different kids. These wipes are hands-down the best wipes I've found. They clean well, and are very durable. We use them for everything from baby butts to faces. (Not the same wipe though lol)",2023-01-05
"Durable/strong, but not soft My son had a red bum while I used these and they were rather uncomfortable for him. After a couple days of use he finally cried ""not those ones"" and it clicked as to why he was more upset at every diaper change than usual. I felt awful for not noticing. They are not very soft at all. They are strong and will hold up well, but they are a bit rough for delicate areas. He also freaked out when I tried these on his face. They are fragrance free, and don't smell particularly strong or anything but there is a slight unpleasant scent to them. I'm not sure if it was the scent or the texture/hardness to them that he didn't like on his face. (To be fair, sometimes he just doesn't like me wiping his face and it might have happened regardless of the wipe). I will use the remainder on myself or for other things, but not on my son. I thought it was a good value though, but my son needs something a bit softer.",2023-01-05
Best wipes ever My son has gotten rashes from other wipes but with Huggies wipes I have no issues.,2023-01-05
" Doesn't smell I don't like supporting a multinational company that generally makes toxic products, however, these wipes are my favorite I've found out of all the natural company wipes I've tried. The price is ridiculously cheap too. That helps. I keep these in all my bathrooms. I think they may be a little too rough for a baby's bum though.",2023-01-05
" Good value Value for money. These wipes are nice and thick, even Ted and large enough for an easy diaper change",2023-01-05
" A little rough These wipes are amazing, just would not recommend for sensitive skin as they are a little rough.",2023-01-05
 excellent excellent,2023-01-06
" I don't have a baby!!! I use these religiously......on myself. I do keep a pack in the bathroom but I also keep some in my car and bedroom. These are a life saver up camping. So many uses... wipe my hands, feet, face, clean the table, wipe down the dog. Possibilities are endless!",2023-01-06
"Awesome There thick, but what I like most, they pull up like keelnix. One at a time. No searching for the next one. Cheers",2023-01-06
" Definitely prefer other brands They don't hold moisture at ALL. They're very thick but they leave little tiny fuzzies on my baby's bottom. I end up using probably double the amount to get baby clean. The smell is okay I guess, but they certainly don't smell like they're unscented.",2023-01-06
" COMES OUT! Although I Don't like Disney, I could Not pass up the Savings😳 I go through 2-3 cases a week for a 23 year-old special-needs child that has a reaction to everything butHuggies wipes🙌🏻 Have to Save where we can, between Diapers, wipes, & Pads, we spend 300 to 400 a month 😱 just on those items🤯",2023-01-06
"The Best Baby Wipes I've used a lot of different baby wipes over the last few years, and these are hands down the best. I can't stand when wipes have that ""dry"" feeling. These have enough moisture without soaking my baby or myself. No weird perfume smells. Great for cleaning hands, wiping faces and cleaning spills in the car too!",2023-01-06
 Great wipes Really like the amount I get for the price,2023-01-06
" Best for camping for all purpose use. I buy these by the carton because we go camping a lot and these work for everything! They don't leave streaks on the windshield. They work for every body part. I love that they're unscented. Went through different brands and when I used this one I never went back. Assuming they are good for babies as well but I've only use them on adult body parts, wiping dishes and windshields, etc. I always keep one in the car.",2023-01-06
Quick and easy These are the best wipes I've found for my babies. They don't irritate their skin and they wipe clean fast. If something is real stuck they have raised parts so you can just rub in a circle to release the stuff that is stuck and it's easy and painless. Highly recommend!!,2023-01-06
" High Quality These are thick, high quality wipes and they're cheap in price. I love huggies brand.",2023-01-06
 Best Wipes Out There These are unscented and even safe for babies to chew on if they want to. Thick and durable. I don't buy any other brand or kind because these have never failed me. Even come out of the package great 95% of the time!,2023-01-06
" Excellent product for the money This product is just the right thickness, and strong enough to make it worthwhile to repurchase. I am pleased with the item and will recommend it to others.",2023-01-06
"Not Just For Babies My son is 16 and likes to feel clean down there. They're also good for camping, especially cleaning underarms or clearing sweat from arms and legs to keep the mosquitoes at bay from the salt. Just DON'T FLUSH them. A plumber told me once - get ready for a $5000-10,000 bill if you do.",2023-01-06
 Good but an old batch different cases Good but an old batch different cases than you find at walmart. The newer style of lid helps them only come out one at a time. This is like an old style so maybe it's been in their warehouse a while I don't know but that's the only downside these wipes are amazing my favorite wipes you only really need one it clean so well,2023-01-06
 good nice,2023-01-06
"No smell or weird residue I had some issues with wipes smelling strongly of fragrances, or having some weird slimy/soapy residue. I did not feel comfortable using them on my baby, so I switched to this one. No residue, no smell, gets the job done. I also love that it comes in such a big pack that I don't have to think about buying wipes as frequently.",2023-01-06
"Wipe is fine, but can be hard to take out. I like that this wipe is thicker than others. They almost feel like paper towels and can be great for blowouts. I'm still torn on if the thickness is better than other natural wipes. My grip with this specific wipe and I bought 3 boxes - there were many packs where when you pull out one wipe, the next one does not come up beyond the surface like what you expect with tissues. Given some packs were fine, I think there may have been some quality control issues. This makes it tremendously annoying when you really want to pull for another wipe but have to use both hands to fish out the next wipe. Because of this annoyance that happened in multiple boxes, I'd wait till after the QA issues to buy more",2023-01-06
 Convenient for stocking up and taking along! These were advertised cheaper than I paid a couple weeks later. They are so convenient when traveling and adults can use them too! Baby has sensitive skin so it was important that I purchase unscented formula.,2023-01-06
These come in handy for wiping just about anything! everything. I even wipe my floor up with these.,2023-01-06
" Bought them for the husband and the sleep machine My husband got a sleep machine last year and was advised to cleanse his face before putting on the mask every time. Baby wipes were suggested. I have bought an assortment of one brand or another over the past year. These Huggies wipes with Mickey Mouse on the front seem to be his fave. He especially likes the clasp on the pouch that holds the wipes because it really holds so the wipes don't dry out. I looked on Amazon and found this bigger box deal with eleven pouches. They came USPS, in the Huggies box with Mickey on the outside, so the mail carrier and the whole neighborhood knows his ""business"" because they weren't in an unmarked box. We have no grandchildren. Obviously, he has so little to worry about in his life!",2023-01-06
 EXCELLENT! I bought it on sale and the brand is great for my newborn baby or for me.,2023-01-06
Does its job but surface is a little rough Great shipping fast shipping! As far as the product I got it for a great price but on a child's bottom you must be careful because even though it cleans well the surface is a little rough,2023-01-06
" Huggies wipes rule Huggies are the best wipes! As a mom of 4 I have tried so many and these are not slippery like some wipes are, but are still very soft. Huggies wipes allow you to get more ahem *stuff* when wiping because of their texture.",2023-01-06
" Excellent It's excellent, I love everything about it. Really soft, fragrance free, simply clean, I can use it to wipe my baby's face without thinking it will irritate him. It's just awesome. Love it 😊",2023-01-06
 Always trust Huggies 💯 Can not go wrong with any Huggies products,2023-01-06
"Our favorite wipes, but for the 3rd time we've ordered and it's missing an entire pack of wipes I'll start by saying I NEVER take the time to leave product reviews. However these are our favorite baby wipes and we have tried them all! My son's skin is incredibly sensitive and we have never had an issue with these. The only thing that has held me back from a 5 star review is that for the 3rd time in a row I have ordered these wipes and they have arrived at my home missing an entire package from the box. Mind you Amazon has remedied the situation every time. It just becomes such a nuisance that I never get exactly what I ordered the 1st time. Other than that we love these. I have always found them gentle, soft, and easy to use.",2023-01-06
 Cleans without irritating Good on kids skin and cleans well,2023-01-06
" The BEST wipes After trying every wipe on the market over the last 15 years of parenting/foster parenting, I can say with confidence we will stick with these! They're the best!",2023-01-06
Simply Clean - enough said Huggies simply clean baby wipes are a must at our house. We use in the restroom as well as for small messes throughout the house and even keep a pack in the car. The 11 pack box is a great deal with the price for just 1 pack being $2.65 now at the Dollar General!,2023-01-06
 Package was opened. Missing items One flap was opened and missing a pack.,2023-01-06
 These aren't what they used to be When I had my first baby five years ago these were awesome! They were my favorites no smell worked great and never any issues so when I had my son I was sure I would use these again but they have changed something in the manufacturing process they are thin they don't clean as easily and they tear!!,2023-01-06
 For my taste a little hard They are not bad nor did they hurt my baby. But they're not that smooth,2023-01-06
" Love these! These are a life saver. We buy these for personal care wipes not for baby wipes. Really good price, unscented, and has been great for my sensitive skin",2023-01-06
"Best wipes for baby skin I am very impressed when I used it on my baby…I am sure it's for baby sensitive skin, it's very soft and scent is good too",2023-01-06
 Great product for baby and elderly adults I love this product I have used it for years on three generations,2023-01-06
 Cheap Cost effective! Cheaper and more for your money,2023-01-07
" These are durable, too. My little fur-baby often wears dog diapers, and I use these to clean his fur when I change them. I also use these for cleaning my apartment. I wipe down my furniture with these so the accumulated dust stays out of the air! I've tried other brands, but they lack the durability of Huggies. These never tear while in use! Great for cleaning my dog and my apartment!",2023-01-07
" Unsented No smell which is great. Thicker than most wipes, however, a little on the dry side. Could use more moisture during the making of this product. Will probably buy again.",2023-01-07

" Favorite wipe ever! I think I've tried every brand of wipes out there over my almost 2 decades of having babies and these are by far my most favorite! Durable, strong and you don't need as many as you would need with other brands.",2023-01-07
" Very good product! They serve their purpose well. I love their container, because they stay moist for a long time. I wish they had just a very light scent, but understand why most prefer no scent.",2023-01-07
 There not that sensitive My son has eczema and it still irritated his skin including when he'd get diaper rashes,2023-01-07
"Great Wipes Would Recommend I love these wipes so much, they are a great price and product. We use these for face, hands, and bottom! They are perfect for our needs and we love them!",2023-01-07
 Best Wipes! Heavy Duty for small and large messes,2023-01-07

 My grandson love it no rash I am good with it because my grandson do not have no rash,2023-01-07
" Cleans well & disintegrates well This is the first time buying this product and was blown away by the cleanliness that this wipe brings and also the moisture being intact even if you forget to close the mud of packet. Also, found that this is somewhat easily tear up paper when you pull with force which is good for environment as it disintegrates fast.",2023-01-07
 Missing a pack Carton arrived with one of the packs from inside missing.,2023-01-07
"Will always buy back. I need it, I need to use it to clean my child's ass every day. I will always buy it back.",2023-01-07
" I used to love them, but not so much anymore. These wipes have always been a little more rough (less soft) than some, but we've used them for our twins more than any other brand. They seem to do a decent job compared to others at their price point. However, they have changed. The wipes themselves seem to have become more rough and less moist, and we hate the new lid on them. The lids were oval and decently sturdy, but the new ones are round and very flimsy. I have to make sure they are out of reach because my twins have broken the tops when trying to open them. The plastic is thinner and they are harder to open than the old ones. I'm not a fan of the wipes today, but I used to recommend them (the old version).",2023-01-07
 Quality Wipes Good for sensitive skin,2023-01-07
 Love them Great wipes,2023-01-07
Huggies wipes for anyone! I love having Huggies wipes for my family. Put them in the car for a quick clean up. Remember Don't Flush them. Great size and no smell just a clean feel. I started buying them for a quick clean up at camp and there good for anyone. I like to buy them by the case. They make a good gift for a baby shower with Huggies Diapers! Definitely recommend you buy some for yourself.,2023-01-07
" DurableVery durable. Cleans well and stays together which are my main concerns. These have been our go to for all of our children. We haven't had any issues with sensitivity in our children, but as always, all children are different. I have no issues recommending these to most anyone.",2023-01-07
 The packages keep ripping The packages kept ripping open in this case. Never had this issue before.,2023-01-07
 As described. Great price and value.,2023-01-07
Sturdier than off brands and cleans well. I use in the bathroom and for doggie and cat cleanups. Work well and a good bargain. Better made and better dispensed than most off brands I have purchased.,2023-01-07
 Hands down the best wipes These wipes have been the best wipes I have ever used on my babies. I've used other Huggies brand but they are really soft and rip easily.. these are thicker and last longer.,2023-01-07
 Perfect wipes for adults I use a dispenser for them that sits atop the toilet tank and before adding any to the container I spray the sides with cologne or a roll on perfume to give them a great aroma while using. I have these on subscription so I don't have to schlep them from the grocery store. Win/Win!,2023-01-07
"My favorite wipes that I buy over and over again. I live in a personal care home and unfortunately where adult briefs. I like that they have no scent because the perfumed ones irritate my skin. What is so weird is that I have paid as $30 for one box of 11 when I was desperate. Seems I pay a different price every time and can't always get from the same seller. Makes buying them rather difficult and often I have to wait more than two days for delivery, sometimes 2 weeks. There is another brand I like but they are sold out almost every single time. So now I order several boxes just to make sure I don't run out. I usually go through two boxes a month. Mostly because the nurses get carried away with using the amount of wipes. I'm always telling them to take it easy because it's not their money and they don't need to use that money because the wipes are really quite sturdy and do the job with just one or two.",2023-01-07
"Worth the price! Definitely worth the money. I love these wipes, they are wonderful. Will be buying again.",2023-01-07
" Soapy wipes The wipes are soapy, if you squeeze on you can see the white bubblie liquid come out. It leaves behind suds almost like soap lathered up and they are super wet so you feel like you have to wash your hands after. The only thing I can compare it to is soap. Definitely not something I want to wipe and leave liquid on my babies bottom with. They are good for wiping hands, feet, and cleaning messes up with though!",2023-01-07
 Best wipes around Love to use these no scent great for sensitive skin and can also be torn into if needed,2023-01-07
Good value. New and improved pop top design. I love the pop tops on these. The design feels very improved from previous plastic pop top designs from this brand. I have a lot less dried up wipe packets from these wipes with the new and improved design. I think they are a good value for your money. The thickness is really good on these too. Added plus that the kids have not had any negative reactions from this brand. Overall I'd recommend them.,2023-01-07
 Good value Its a good value for the money.,2023-01-07
 Gift Bought as a gift for my expectant niece.,2023-01-07
 Don't like them. I didn't think what Huggies wipes I bought would matter. Apparently I was wrong. I definitely prefer the natural care Huggies wipes! These are hard to get out and you end up tearing them.,2023-01-07
" good but not the best these are decent wipes, not my favorite but it doesn't matter much to me I just look for deals and this happened to be on sale",2023-01-07
 Good soft and sturdy smells nice Good,2023-01-07
"Good wipes - great value & price. For the price, it's a no-brainer. Even the Amazon brand wipes are more expensive than these brand-name baby wipes. I purchase them for home use and they also for donations to food pantries who distribute baby items. You get the most for your money! Highly recommend. Wipes are soft, but break easily. Unscented. Don't pull apart.",2023-01-07

 Good deal & product met expectations Product met expectations Good deal,2023-01-07
 Soft Soft and smooth product not to cold and wet,2023-01-07
" Great One side of each wipe is slightly scratchy when used on my face. That's pretty standard for this particular type of wipe. If you plan on using on faces, I would get the shea butter Huggies or the special delivery Huggies, which I believe is unscented as well.",2023-01-07
Best wipes! I love these wipes. They're soft and durable. No scent which is great for sensitive skin. We use these for everything. These will not burn sensitive skin caused by diaper rash. Other brands that are “sensitive” have a funky smell which makes me wonder what's in them. And they burn the skin. These have absolutely zero smell!!!,2023-01-07
 Value product Bought these for my grandson. Daughter loves how gentle they are on baby's skin. Great value product,2023-01-07
 They work Don't stay moist long enough after opening,2023-01-07
" Best wipes you can buy In our house, we have tried many different brands of wipes, used to clean your butt after you go... NONE of them compare to Huggies unscented baby wipes. Amazing cleaning power and you won't have to reach for another because Huggies wipes are huge compared to competitors, like Pampers. Try them, you'll like them.",2023-01-07
 Nice Good for newborns,2023-01-07

"Good And Clean Great product for the price, so I will be ordering again once the time comes.",2023-01-07
 Does the job We use these like the duck tap of motherhood. It fixes everything. I keep a pack in the car and in the bathroom. We also use it for our English bulldog because that breed can get messy in that area. It is very gentle and moist enough to get the job done.,2023-01-07
" First package didn't arrive! Seller sent replacement Promptly We use these wipes since our son was born and still today- he's 5! He has very delicate skin and we never had an issue, they clean well, smell nutral and don't tear when heavy duty :) they make our life easier after we tried SO many over the years - we always return to our box of these wipes! I like the amount in a single pack, the cap closes well (while the new round design doesn't close as easy and perfect, and the plastic seems thinner - I wonder If those wipes are meant to go in a refill box",2023-01-07
Highly recommend these wipes I highly recommend these for any size/age of child.,2023-01-07
 Great The wipes came early and great price just wish huggies made the wipes softer,2023-01-07
 Best wipes I've used these since my daughter was born and no rashes ever,2023-01-07
 No rash It does not irritate my grandson's sensitive skin and cleans well. It gets the job done and comes in handy for other small wipe ups!!! thick and durable,2023-01-07
" Great other than they tear easily Honestly Walmart parents choice brand is better, because they don't rip apart. These are great for sensitive skin though no issues there.",2023-01-07
"Perfect for artisans and painters! I am an enamelist and glass enameling powder is used. I use it to keep my work station as sanitary as possible Also used for sanding/grinding edges of metal, wiping down as I go.Secondly am a painter and these are also wonderful for in between brush cleanups before the water basin.Also keep a PACK IN KITCHEN - Wonderful for kitchen small kitchen spills. Yup one in garage. Easier than running back in the house for a wet rag! Love 'em! Bathroom - for sure. So I'm loving MY HUGGIES!",2023-01-07
" Nice price but the wipe breaks easily. Overall it's good. Just when you take the first few wipes, it breaks easily.",2023-01-07

"Great deal. Won't find a better wipe. I enjoy all of the Huggie wipes. Depending on who I'm using the wipe on. If it's on a child under 2 years of age, I fr rather use the scent less wipes .

"Quality no scented baby wipe This quipes are the best. No scent, easy to pull them up, nice packing. Perhaps the company can do them softer. It has great thickness so that you don't get poop on your hand. The price reflects that, but overall is not too pricey. No allergy or diaper rash with the use. Will purchase them until my baby is done with the diapers.",2023-01-07
" Good wipes, rip easily (low quality) The wipes rip when you pull them out of the dispenser. It's not the worst thing but it's definitely annoying. Apart from that they're great for an entice skin and they don't have a bad smell at all - a scented really does mean unscented.",2023-01-07
" Good, tears kinda easily Often tears easily when pulling out of package",2023-01-07
 Good Pretty good wipe,2023-01-07
 Best wipes These are the best baby wipes I've sued. My son was breaking out from other wipes so I tried this. The only con is it rips like tissue paper.,2023-01-07
Great Wipes! These wipes are unscented and have no smell. They clean very well and have been great for baby skin.,2023-01-07
" Not just for babies anymore I have read that baby wipes are the salvation for the elderly, I love that these come in a product that does not cause my sensitive skin to rebel. And I am preachin' the baby wipes gospel to all my old time friends who complain that toilet paper just doesn't do the job anymore. Added bonus is that they are usable for a moist wipe for other things too. Just do not flush, you will need to keep a waste container near the commode to save on plumber bills. Added bonus, your finger wont poke through when you wipe.",2023-01-07

" Huggies is my brand Huggies has always been my families go-to brand and now starting my own family, they are mine. Loyal to this brand of Huggies because they are on the cheaper side of disposable baby products. I love that there is no smell to them as I have a sensitive nose. They do the job. And they get my Fetch point rewards.",2023-01-08

" The Best I love everything about these baby wipes. I have been using them on my great grandchildren now for three years and they are wonderful. They clean them without leaving any after smell and they have never gotten diaper rash. Plus, I can use these without any scent to wipe their faces and hands. I highly recommend these to anyone. My granddaughter has sensitive skin also...and She has never broken out while we have used these. After I showed her parents what I was using and gave them a box, they won't use anything else.",2023-01-08

 Resistant and soft Good product,2023-01-08
" Not as pictured The wipes themselves are good—standard Huggies wipes, however, the packaging is different. I bought a case based on the picture of the package flip top going to the side. I have found the side flip top easier to use one-handed. When opening to the side, the package stays stable and the lid stays open. The case I received—all 11 of the packages flip top goes to the back (as pictured in my review photo. I am not happy about that!!! Either update the product photo, or ship the right product.",2023-01-08
 The softness For my 1 yr old baby,2023-01-08
