"👃🏼Smell ≈ Savagely fantastic.

🦾Performance/Projection/Longevity ≈ Decent power. About arms length, 6~8 ft. radius. About 6~8 hrs. on skin. Above 6~8+ hrs. on clothes.

🌄Versatility🌃 ≈ Anywhere at anytime during Summer &amp; Spring. Maybe... Fall &amp; Winter.

💸Price/Value🏷️ ≈ An exorbitant price. I feel, Dior Sauvage EDT, is way over priced. Even for a 6.7~fl.oz. So, for me to actually spend this amount of money, is very rare. Overall... It's an uneconomical purchase. But, I wanted to have it.

📝Anyways... I hope my truthful and honest, review/opinion, assessed through my knowledge and experience of this cologne, helps! I know that I really appreciate, honest and truthful, opinions/reviews.",2023-01-03
El perfume es genial pero es un vendedor externo que pone muchas trabas ya que la unidad que he recibido tiene problemas en el atomizador hacer que pierda líquido el cual perdió bastante en el transporte y perdí un 80% del mismo aun estoy a la espera del vendedor para saber que opciones tengo ya que las enviadas inicialmente las veo una estafa ya que si me quedo con el producto me reembolsa solo 35 usd una cantidad insignificante ya que el perfume pasa los 160 usd y tan solo me llego poco menos del 20% del líquido! Esperemos que todo salga bien,2023-01-03
"If men say when they wear this product they have women asking what perfume they are wearing, it is because the women want to buy it and wear it on themselves.

This stuff smells like something my mother would have worn in the 1980s. It literally smells like the word perfume - there is nothing distinctive about it other than it does not belong on a man's body.

I have tried to give the full bottle away for a month now - for free, and no one I have asked will take it.",2023-01-01
"Bought this just about a year ago, from the minute I got it and sprayed it on I knew something was wrong. I’ve had numerous bottles of this cologne throughout the years and they all smelled the same. This one does not smell like real Dior Savage nor does it last on your body for more than 10 minutes. Pretty upsetting that I spent $158.00 on a fake bottle of cologne that I’ve had for a year and haven’t used",2023-01-04
"Compré esta colonia con la seguridad que no iba sufrir un desencanto pero es que como si rociara alcohol en mi cuerpo, no se siente ni a 10 minutos de haberla usado, me siento estafado totalmente disculpe que sea tan duro pero he tenido colonias baratas y siento mas el aroma que está famosa colonia Sauvage de Dior …. 90 dólares tirados por agua con alcohol,,, la verdad una decepción total",2023-01-05
"This is 100% authentic!. You can tell by the batch codes on the bottom (has to match with the one on the box) and the bottle itself

real if: has good magnetic cap, bee logo inside of cap, of course the codes, and how clear the words are on the bottom of the bottle. (If it is kind of hard to read it is real)

ALSO PAIR THIS WITH THE MIDNIGHT BATH AND BODYWORKS LOTION. It’s amazing!",2023-01-05
"Sprayer on product does not work properly and leaks when applied. Have contacted seller with concerns; however, have not received a response. 100 bucks down the drain. Also it was not a parfume product so its over priced at price advertised. I'd steer clear of this seller given price point way too high and product defective with no customer support to resolve.",2023-01-04
"Tengo la sensación de que es un producto fake, por la razon de que el batch code es diferente, tengo una pequeña colección de perfumes y en todos caja y frasco tienen el mismo batch code, asi que este es una imitación bien realizada, lo mas importante el olor no es malo pero no es tan explosivo como se supone que debe ser un sauvage",2023-01-03
"I am the guy who has been using dior for long time. So i know how/long it smells/stays on you.. so far i was always buying it at the store..this time i tried to get online/amazon..this is just NOT dior. It is mixing of water and alcohol…it is not a perfume… DO NOT BUY THIS ONE…it is up to u, but i’ll never get it..bye",2023-01-05
"This EDT is the pride of Sauvage, I usually would go for the stronger concentrations but this is where Sauvage made their name and if you haven't tried the edt you need to try it, it is a fresh and woody scent but what captivates me most is the wood, I see why women crave it so much.",2023-01-04
"Bought this for my middle son as a gift and it smells wonderful. A little goes a long way. I was concerned at first by the cost, but that left after he received it. It last all day and he doesn’t use a lot. It is going to last a long time. This in turn makes it a great value.",2023-01-05
"I read a lot of comments on the item as being fake. The cologne that I received is the real deal, the cologne box was plastic wrapped with the Dior sticker. I have ordered directly from Dior and this product was delivered the same way. Love the scent too.",2023-01-03
"&nbsp;My name is Rafael Rivera that's how the cologne came they busted came in the box it was busted so is busted till I don't know that's how it came pretty bad busted the other cologne was falling off so it was damaging the box there's the box
Ok",2023-01-05
I’ve been using and buying this cologne from department stores since it came out .. first time ordering threw this company and it’s like a watered down version .. it hardly has any sent .. contacted the seller and got no response.. 👎🏽👎🏽🤬,2023-01-03
"Received very fast and as stated.  I am disappointed though with the lack of long acting smell (weak after a couple hours)! Also came with missing liquid (leaking out from the bottle), and very hard time with Amazon for a replacement!",2023-01-01
It's not bad once the opening fades away to unmask the sweetness of the fragrance...i dont like the opening of the fragrance... longevity is lacking unless you spray 6-7 times... Maybe that's what you get out of the EDT...,2023-01-05
Dislike 👎 👎 the scent did not last at all I will not buy any fragrances from Amazon again. I looked pass some of the comments about this product but know I will pay more attention to them thanks but no thank you.,2023-01-05
"I've worn this cologne for many years and I highly recommend it smells great and I'm a very hard person so please that way...
But I guarantee you you're sent will be memorable every time you walk into a room.",2023-01-05
It does not smell nowhere near dior sauvage it smell like cheapest dollar store perfume .. it dont even last 10min I wouldn't recommended to use even as bathroom air freshner .. its garbage FAKE,2023-01-04
I have been buying this brand for years. I can tell it’s been water down and so can others than often smell my cologne! Sad if this is the case! Won’t buy from this vender again..,2023-01-01
My boyfriend loved this fragrance when sampling in a popular franchise store and I was happy to find it conveniently on Amazon and purchased it as part of his Valentine gift.,2023-01-05
"I found this on a recommended list, but found the smell to be kind of soapy. Unfortunately it's non-returnable but I probably wouldn't use this, there are better scents.",2023-01-02
Smells amazing long lasting too ! Wasn’t fake either unlike some of the reviews if I do get a bad order I’ll update .Will buy again when I use all this big bottle haha,2023-01-02
The Cologne was awesome. I bought it for my son for Father’s Day and then ordered it for a coworker. When he sprayed it it I had never smelled something so wonderful.,2023-01-03
"Pay close attention to your purchases, because there is a fake that appears a lot like the Dior Sauvage brand, but is not even close to the original.",2023-01-03
"I'm not a person that enjoyed complaining. However, I have been using Dior Sauvage for 3 years straight. The bottle I received this time, is fake.",2023-01-04
Bought for my husband as a present.. ended up being a present for me cuz it smells amazing on him and last all day.. definitely worth the money.,2023-01-02
Estoy aún probándolo. en mi caso no dura como antes pero huele muy bien. Tal vez deba dejarle macerar por 1 mes a ver si mejora su rendimiento.,2023-01-03
"Not as strong.
Decent scent.
Been using for a long time.
Over the time, Sauvage has lost the strength and people have gotten used to this.",2023-01-05
"My wife really loves the scent of this product…and I do too!  While it is pricey, it only takes a little bit to make the right impact.",2023-01-05
"This is not the real Sauvage Dior Cologne, it is a fake version of the cologne and anyone who buys it needs an immediate refund!",2023-01-03
All that matters is my son loves his gift. I wish I could have afforded the larger size for him. Even the cap is fascinating!,2023-01-04
Purchased this for my boyfriend and he loves it! It is exactly what is advertised. The scent smells so good! Def a good buy!,2023-01-03
"Las burbujas duran más de 12 segundos el olor no sé pero no me da como algo, tiene pinta de rellenado en embase original",2023-01-03
"Well I haven’t had one person comment on the cologne yet.
 I like it for me in general but over priced for no reactions",2023-01-05
Realmente no se que numeración debe tener para ser original pero en comparación con los originales no veo diferencias,2023-01-03
Bought this for my dad and he loved it. No problem with delivery which is good to know as it is a delicate  bottle.,2023-01-04
Got this for my boyfriend! Omg! He will never be without this cologne. We just call it his “Johnny” cologne 🤣,2023-01-03
This didn’t smell correct so stopped at a couple stores and they agreed something isn’t right with this item!,2023-01-04
"Delivery and packaging is awesome but the cologne itself is mediocre. I honestly,expected more but oh well.",2023-01-05
"I love this cologne, I’ve used it for years and have received a bunch of compliments on how it smells",2023-01-05
The scent does not last long at all. It’s almost like it’s watered down. Worst purchase I ever made,2023-01-03

Nephew was greatly appreciative and he smells like he acts ...wonderfully!!,2023-01-01
