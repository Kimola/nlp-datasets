"January 5, 2025",Fit is good. No problems.
"January 4, 2025",Nice looking and comfortable shoes
"January 4, 2025",I like the shoe and size as mentioned in the website. Better to buy this type of shoes online than to go to Mall.
"December 31, 2024",Good arch support
"December 29, 2024",I ended up grabbing these as a gift for a family member who loves Nike. They loved these sneakers and said that they're among the most comfortable ones they have in their collection.
"December 29, 2024",Love the shoes will buy again..

"December 20, 2024","Style, quality, and still available after my first purchase of the same shoe in 2020!!!ðŸ˜‰"
"December 20, 2024",They are comfortable and long lasting
"December 19, 2024","Nike shoes are predictable.  Once you've tried a pair, you know your size and can always buy another pair knowing they will fit.My only beef is that they aren't all that durable.  The sole gives out in less than 1 year's time.  But they are comfy."
"December 6, 2024","Been a Nike shoe guy for a long time, these are the most narrow Iâ€™ve ever purchased."

"October 26, 2024",Iâ€™ve been buying this exact sneaker for years in most of its color choices. I really like them and to order on line is easy because I know exactly what Iâ€™m getting from size fitment to quality. Like some I pull the original insole out right away and add one that has a bit more arch support and away I go. I know Iâ€™ll have this shoe for a couple years to rotate out with the other color choices I already have. Clearly the price and availability has turned into a real downer! Canâ€™t just run to a shoe store to buy anymore and the price has doubled from years past!. Might have to move on someday!.
"October 26, 2024","One of the fabric loops that function for shoe lace eyelets ripped away from the main body of the shoe. I had to see it up myself to make the shoe functional, but it never looked right. It was that or go through the hassle if a return and not having shoes for jogging. The quality of the stitching is questionable. Some good aspects, but unreliable quality. Overall, I was left feeling disappointment."
"October 22, 2024",Very comfortable and durable. Stylish too.
"October 15, 2024",These are very comfortable and look awesome!
"October 13, 2024",Translate review to English
"October 11, 2024",They are exactly what I ordered.
"October 10, 2024",Hands down the best shoes Nike made for work.  I have not found any other shoes that are comfortable and durable.  Can't understand why Nike discontinued these.
"October 9, 2024","Love the style of shoe, and it feels good,also my feet feel elevated...I will buy this style of Nike again soon! :)"
"September 15, 2024","Color is great, worth the money. They fit great, durable, lightweight. Not to noisy."
"September 14, 2024",Good quality! Very comfortable I recommend them

"September 7, 2024",For work  it's good so far
"September 4, 2024",These shoes last . Very comfortable too!
"September 3, 2024",I love the style of the shoe.  A bit pricey from what i notmally pay. They fit great. The weight is good. Appears to be very durable.

"August 31, 2024","I used to own a pair a few years ago and they are hard to find. I enjoy how comfortable they are when running and working out. Good traction when powerlifting. Light weight for running, breathable so no smelly feet lol. I got them in black but I believe they come in white too. Durable as heck, I will hike in these. Give em a try."
"August 29, 2024",Comfortable for walking and jogging.

"August 25, 2024",Have bought these before for a gift. Comfortable. True to size. Good looking and unique.
"August 23, 2024",Very good shoes feel good on my feet.
"August 23, 2024",Perfect color
"August 20, 2024",I loved everything about them they fit better than any other pair I have ever bought and people will comment on how sharp and cool looking they are Very Satisfied
"August 10, 2024",They make two different Nike torch 4's and on this style I had to order a half size bigger to get them to fit comfortably.
"August 10, 2024",Very comfortable. Excellent price.
"August 8, 2024","These black Nikes are so sharp-looking, just as pictured. My 15 year-old grandson loves them. They arrived quickly."
"August 3, 2024",This shoe fit best for me because it was a narrow running shoe.  Most shoes are wide and just will not work for me. Quite pleased with this product. I will use for work and plan to purchase more very soon. Thank you. The price was more than what I expected.
"July 26, 2024","Authentic Nike product, right size and exactly what I expected."
"July 25, 2024","Great shoes; however, sole wears out too quick."
"July 22, 2024",Husband loves them and wears them for work every day
"July 21, 2024",Perfect fit. My husbands favorite style! Comfy! One of the best styles Nike made to date.
"July 21, 2024",Love these shoes. A little tight. Bit that what I aanted
"July 20, 2024",These are great for jogging yet somewhat harsh on the feet. Good cross trainer.
"July 18, 2024",Shoes are comfy and light weight.  They look great.  Only issue I had was the front tow suede material started cracking after a month.  Kind of sucks because the rest of the shoe is really nice inside out.
"July 12, 2024","Usually the first week is hell for new shoes but these are very comfortable from the start.  Hoping they won't stretch out too much.Normally wear 10.5 but ordered 11.0.  Perfect fit so my opinion, they run small. Also is a narrow shoe. I have narrow and flat feet so the arch support is more than adequate and comfortable. Noticeable support without discomfort.I hope their durability is as great as the fit. Gave up on Nike years ago because their shoes fell apart after months."
"July 11, 2024",At first I thought it was mid delivered but I finally just got them . Thanks
"July 1, 2024",Confortable for running
"June 12, 2024",My son goes through shoes like crazy and finding these on Amazon was great! They were cheaper than purchasing in store anywhere and fit him just right.
"May 14, 2024",I've had 2 pairs for running and would use them for yard work after I wore them out for running. Now I just bought a pair for casual wearing.
"April 23, 2024",Very comfortable shoe. Appears to be very well-made. Depending on how active a person is depends on how long a shoe lasts with wear and tear. Because of the fit and comfort Iâ€™m reading this five stars. Weâ€™ll just have to see how long they last.
"April 23, 2024",I used this product as a shoe and since nike stopped doing shocks I have held back on buying any nicer Nikes but these are nice I dig them and they like me too .. totally comfortable I think I could wear these out
"April 17, 2024","These are some great style NIKE but definitely not what you'd wear for running. They just don't have the necessary bounce in the forefoot to provide adequate cushioning and the heel has barely the reflex to justify these as runners. These are more of a ""Street Style"" casual dress shoes, and here's where they excel, in looks and short term comfort for daily wear. Additionally: Order a Half to Whole Size larger than your normal size."
"April 16, 2024",These Nike shoes are so far go good.  A beautiful set of shoes that fit just about perfect.  I was worried when I ordered these shoes initially because I have wide feet.  They fit like a glove.  I purchased these two months ago but no sign of wear so far.
"April 5, 2024",Like Nike takes some time to break them in but feel good
"April 4, 2024","The feel of this shoe was tight at the top of shoe.  It would have caused serious discomfort over time.Loosing laces greatly did not resolve this on both shoes and even walking for a 1/2 mile and then loosening again did not help.Perhaps it will for someone else but not me at 10.5""."
"March 23, 2024",This style of Nike is the only shoe I've ever worn that I felt it improved my performance. I remember feeling it and laughing to myself because I thought of the +1 movement speed in RPG games. They have a perfect forward lean to them when you move forward that's good for a lot of athletic motions.
"February 7, 2024",Itâ€™s an amazing walking shoes. Looks great and comfortable. A little slippery with wet places.
"January 22, 2024",Brought this for a Christmas gift he love this style and I purchased at a sale price. Very nice looking Nike shoes. Comfortable and Stylish.
"August 9, 2020","Ive bought a pair of Torch 4 every year since 2013 I think.  I go through Tennis Shoes quickly.  I love the color scheme of this pair.  However as they get dirty you can really see darker stains.I love the comfort of the Torch 4, especially the sole.  I wear orthotics, and they work great in these shoes.  I do find over time the cushion fades and the support is lost.  This is a big reason I buy new ones yearly.  Plus the sole and fabric wears after heavy use.The only downside really is the length of the laces.  You have to really lace these tight to be able to tie in a bow.I have found these cheaper on sale in stores, but I would buy them again at this price.Update 12/2020: I did in fact buy another pair.  First pair had the material against the heel wear a hole making it uncomfortable.  I wouldnt say they were defective as I wore them for over 4 months almost daily and I wear insoles.  So it was just wear and tear in my opinion."
