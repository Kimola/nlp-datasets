"Has flaws, but overall its a pretty solid system This review is targeted at newcomers so for veterans of Nintendo products, not much new information here! As for everyone else looking at this gaming system wondering if its right for them, I'll do my best to explain what this model in particular brings to the table. In my particular case a: ""Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)""Introduction to the system/What is a Nintendo Switch?:The Nintendo Switch is a ""hybrid system"". Lets break it down to its core do understand what people mean by ""hybrid system"", lets start with what is basically a gaming tablet with a plastic screen and a multi-touch-touchscreen. This is the ""Switch itself"" so to speak. For a ""console"", it is EXTREMELY thin in comparison to a PS4 or Xbox One for example. This also means it takes significantly less energy to run. The internal cooling fan is also significantly quieter than either of the prior two other consoles mentioned.That multi-touch-touchscreen allows for certain mobile games like Muse Dash, VOEZ, Deemo, and many others to be ported to the Switch without compromising their touch screen gimmicks from their mobile phone counterparts. Despite this, many of them do have support for button controls. Many Switch games gives you options on how you want to play and this is a running theme with the Switch.Now for the controllers which are ""hybrid controllers"" in a way. For those of you who used the Nintendo Wii, these ""Joy Cons"" share and improved upon the motion controls from the Wii days, except in addition to the motion controls, Nintendo also made the actual button layout resemble a regular controller like the button layout found on a Xbox One controller for example. Not that weird button layout on the Wii for example. This means both the Wii crowd can assimilate into this new generation of Nintendo, along side the core gamers who would prefer a more ""traditional"" controller button set up.Normally a player would use both Joy Cons together as a pair, whether that be attached to the Switch Tablet itself to be played on the go like a 3DS (be it much longer than a 3DS), at home and connected to a plastic grip that gives you those controller ""thighs"" to make it easier to hold and to make it feel more like a more traditional controller even more. You can even use the Joy Cons without them being attached to anything like the Wiimote and Numchuck, but without that annoying wire in between your controllers. This ""detached"" controller style option with the Joy Cons allows you to play in positions otherwise impossible with a more ""static"" controller. For example, you can play with one arm behind your head while the other arm is resting on your stomach as you play from your bed or couch.These Joy Cons also have two buttons on the plastic rails that connect them to the Switch Tablet piece. These buttons are functional and you can actually use just a single Joy Con per player in certain supported games.Key word ""supported games"". This is where the main issue with the Nintendo Switch lies, Nintendo laid the foundation for developers to have the best tools at their deposal but not all of them use them. Some developers have games that cost less overall on the Switch than their original releases on other systems, or from mobile with mobile's atrocious micro-transactions , meanwhile there's other developers that neither have the full game on the physical game cartridges while having the audacity to be more expensive on the Switch. But again, its ALL developer based. Research the game developers in question to see if you're getting the best value for buying their ports (or original) releases on the Nintendo Switch.Oh right, this gaming system uses cartridges. Don't worry, they're not those huge ones from the Nintendo 64 days! They're more Nintendo 3DS sized if anything. If the developer you choose did it properly, a entire game can fit on these cartridges. This means you can play those properly done physical releases immediately without any additional downloads. But again, developer based. Some of them DO only ""partially"" have the game on the Switch Cartridge(s). Do your research.Now to talk about the Dock that connects the Switch Tablet to a TV.If you open up the back side of the Dock, there should be two slits near the bottom of the Dock. The Switch Tablet has two air vents that when ""docked"" should be right up against those vents. Please try not to block off those vents so the Switch Tablet as a easier time cooling itself off while you (and others) play in ""TV Mode"". The Switch Tablet also has a air-vent on the top. So keep that area of the Switch Tablet clear as well.This particular model of the Nintendo Switch, model number ""HAC-001(-01)"", is different from day one Nintendo Switch systems in the sense that Switches with the model number ""HAC-001(-01)"" have better battery life. For example, day one Switches would run really graphically/resource intensive games for about 2 hours 30 minutes (or 2.5 hours) minimum. Whereas this new ""HAC-001(-01)"" numbered Switch(es) can run those games for up to 4.5 hours minimum in ""handheld mode"". The way these ""new Switches"" accomplish this is by having a more efficient component in the inside of the Tablet piece. This also means these new Switches are more energy efficient and less prone to overheating than the day one models. So this is even helpful for people who would use this gaming system for TV use.If you don't have a Switch yet, I recommend this model for its versatility. You never know when you'll change your mind on ""how"" you want to play. I used to use it mostly in TV mode but eventually started using it more and more while outside in general. For example, on the bus, while waiting for something to start whether it be a class, jury duty, meeting, you name it. The Nintendo Switch will make that wait all the less painful. Waiting to be called or dismissed for jury duty especially.Oh, I almost forgot! You CAN use power banks with the Nintendo Switch! The minimum power requirements for a power bank to work with a Nintendo Switch is 5 Volts, and 2.4 Amps. The cable you use to plug the Switch Tablet with a power bank can be found bundled with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, or the Nintendo Switch Charging Grip. Both of those products come with the USB cable required to use a Nintendo Switch with a power bank. So even if you manage to drain this new Switch's battery life on a long trip, bring a battery bank and you can extend its battery life even further. But again, this mostly won't be needed unless you're on a air ride for over 7 hours or so. Anything less than that, if you're smart about it, you can get away with just the Switch's battery life.Speaking of battery life, the Joy Cons each have a estimated battery life of 20 hours each. Let me repeat that, 20 hours. That brings its competition's controllers to shame!So if you keep your Joy Cons charged overnight (they charge when connected to the Switch Tablet while the Tablet is charging in either the Dock or via battery bank), they ain't going to die unless you deliberately go out of your way not to charge them at least once a week.When their batteries are completely dead, both the Switch Tablet and one pair of Joy Cons takes about 3 hours to fully charge everything. So if you're able to, put the Switch Tablet with the pair of Joy Cons connected to it, and leave the three of them in the Dock overnight to keep everything nice and charged for tomorrows challenges.Get creative, once you get used to the options the Nintendo Switch offers, going to anything else, you'll realize that you'd taken for granted with the Nintendo Switch! In my particular case, using the two Joy Cons in each hand unconnected. I can't do that with a keyboard and mouse! So get your Joy Cons, get them in a position that works for you, get cozy on your couch, bed, etc. and have some fun with your game(s) of choice!Just keep in mind it is a GAMING SYSTEM FIRST, and the ""entertainment media center"" SECOND. So as of January 15th, 2020 don't expect things like Netflix to be on this machine. If you treat it as a DEDICATED gaming system, you're in for one hell of a ride!Just don't forget your screen protector since the Switch Tablet's screen is made of plastic!If you don't want to go through all of them, get this one:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XDWBPMZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1It should serve most peoples' needs. Its durable, cheap, anti-glare, self heals from minor scratches, etc. Its the most value for the price I've found from searching through all of what Amazon has as far as Switch Tablet screen protectors go.As far as the ""system itself"" goes, this is pretty much all of the information that you'd need. Everything else is developer centered, game wise. Do your research, and think very carefully which developers will give you the best bang for your buck!",1/1/23
"It’s pretty but not sturdy. This is my first switch console. So let me start off by saying the console itself is absolutely beautiful. The design on the back is so pretty and the joycons are gorgeous as well.My biggest issue is not the console itself. But the accessories for it. I’m sure you’ve seen the terrible reviews for the joycons themselves. If you haven’t please check them out. I had done my research on them before hand and ended up buying a different controller just because I was so nervous about using the joycons. The idea is awesome. But they feel so flimsy and cheap. I hadn’t planned to even use the ones that came with the console. I planned to put them away as collectors items. But of course I had to use them to start up the console. As I was holding them I felt the plastic on the back of the right joycon move and make a loud snap. I thought I broke it and I hadn’t even done anything. I was just setting up the console. The colors may look great. But after having that as my first experience I do believe all the reviews I’ve seen for them.The next thing that feels awful is the dock. I had planned to play with the console docked the majority of the time. But just putting the console in makes me cringe because no matter how gentle or slow you are it still hits the sides of the dock when attempt to dock it. There’s only two tiny pieces of soft rubber like material in the dock itself. Which doesn’t protect the console enough. So I ended up buying a screen protector immediately just to give some protection from the dock itself. Just pushing the power button makes the console move and jiggle around in the dock, making it repeatedly hit hard plastic. It doesn’t feel secure whatsoever. The actual part that connects to the switch inside of the dock is very lose as well. The door on the back of the dock also feels cheap. Reminds me of the doors on the Wii. It feels like it could pop off rather easily.Let’s move on to the console a little bit. I have used the kickstand. It doesn’t feel super stable and I’d worry if I didn’t have it standing up on a very stable surface. I’d be nervous to have it anywhere near children or accident prone people like me while using it. The screen looks great though. But the hdmi quality of the console menu looks horrible on my monitor. Games seem to look great though, just not the menu/home/settings etc. So I’m not sure if there’s a way to fix that or not. I play other consoles on my monitor and they look beautiful. Another thing, while holding the console with the joycons attached it feels huge. Too big, awkward, and heavy for my tiny hands and I wasn’t even holding it that long. So if you are thinking about getting the switch to playing more mobile and you have tiny hands, maybe consider a switch lite? Unless you want docking and kick stand capabilities which isn’t something the lite can do.The console works great. It’s fast and easy to use and navigate. The buttons feel sturdy as well. I’ve been playing Animal Crossing for hours while docked and the console never gets hot. Just a little warm.Overall this console was a cool idea. Just wish they would have put a little more time and money into making some parts a little more sturdy.",1/5/23
"Very well designed console but age has shown The switch is a very well designed console that remains versatile and great for portability. However, the hardware, high reoccurring costs for getting games, and exclusivity to Nintendo store causes it to not be perfect, especially when the price remains close to original.This console does a lot of things right. The controllers are easy to use and come with accessories for different handheld modes. Battery life on both the switch and the joycons are pretty good. Touch screen is very responsive and rarely causes mistakes. Easy to use out of the box and setup is painless. Has the ability to backup save data to the cloud and restore on another switch if needed. And of course, putting it on the big screen makes things that much better.Below are some of the major problems that I believe will impact purchasing decision.Cost is the most important to me. When you are spending around $300 for a console, you shouldn't be expected to pay extreme prices for the games. However, Nintendo continues to sell to you that way. While many games get discounted during sales, there are still a lot of popular games that will sell for $60. Games that are available on PC that are on the Nintendo store also seem to sell higher there. The entry cost may be $300, but the expect to rack up a couple more hundred if you want the latest games. Don't forget, you also need to pay for the Nintendo online membership to get full functionality on a lot of these games.Hardware is another big issue. Hardware is very lacking at this point. First time launching into the Nintendo store, I'm already experiencing lag that really shouldn't happen. For most games, things run fine. But newer games have already had users reporting poor user experience. The hardware is in dire need of an update to be able to support new games. If considering OLED version, I would not buy unless you really value the larger screen and like playing on the go. Switch still only supports 1080p when docked. And for those of you who like using bluetooth speakers, know that once you hookup a bluetooth speaker, you are limited to pairing 2 controllers.Nintendo environment reminds me a bit of Apple. Nintendo likes to make their things exclusive to them. This means that only the switch can use the Nintendo store for games and it's also the only place. If the game you want to play is not on the Nintendo store, then you're out of luck. There are other competitors out there that allow you to put any software on their handheld consoles, which allow for a plethora of different options. However, with Nintendo, you are stuck in their environment.Overall, still a fun console with some of the best Nintendo games. However, unless you already have a number of games you like, it's not worth spending the money on an outdated console for 1 or 2 games.",1/1/23
"Best battery life, largest screen and HD rumble make this a better buy than the Lite version. I don’t use this the way that Nintendo advertises; predominantly hand held.  I have the Skull & Company Grip Case attached at all times and only play in handheld mode.  The Switch Lite is too small and doesn’t have the HD rumble like this one has.  This model is the better one with the longest battery life currently available.  This is not designed with comfort in mind for handheld play sessions so the Lite may be a better option if comfort is important.  If you get hand cramps like I do, I highly recommend the Skull & Company grip case.  They also have a great travel case that you can get with it that has plenty of space for the switch with case and joycons attached and space for games, a power adapter and power bank.  It is very good quality and the Switch is dockable with the grip case attached.The switch itself has a much faster, more user friendly, prettier, less congested graphics user interface than all of Nintendo’s previous consoles.  It has a solid state drive for saving and downloading some games, and is expandable with the purchase of Micro SD cards for additional space.  The online store is easy to use and probably the best Nintendo has ever had.  Easy to sort by price, genre, developer.  It is fast and easy to use and you can sort for free games and demos too.  The load time between starting games and between cut scenes in game is very quick on hard drive, sd card, and game cartridge.  Much quicker than nintendo’s previous consoles.  I haven’t played with the joy cons detached so I can’t comment on how responsive the joycons are to movement and player interaction when joycons are detached.  The HD rumble is more subtle than on PS4 and XBox but some games have used it very well.  Mario Odyssey for example has done a great job of blending the environments in some levels to match well with the rumble feedback; its hard to explain, but this feels like the next step in controller evolution and PS5 and NextBox will be adopting a similar tech so more developers should get on board with HD Rumble in future games, hopefully.  The switch buttons have a nice click and feel like they will last, much like most of Nintendo’s products but the stick feels a little looser than the PS4.  I would like Nintendo to tighten that up for the Pro version.  Overall, this is decades of Nintendo engineering in the making which has resulted in, arguably their best console to date.  It is going to shatter console sales records for good reason.  I highly recommend this version of the Switch for the battery life, larger screen and hd rumble, but you may want to get a comfort grip if you will be using it predominantly as a handheld.  I no longer play on my 3DS because this is a much better player experience.",1/5/23
"(New) Nintendo Switch HAC-001(-01) This revised model of the Switch comes with a number of features that I honestly can't fully appreciate as someone who didn't own the previous model. The big thing that drew me in was the extended battery life, even though so far I haven't played much in handheld mode and not at all in tabletop, but they use the same amount of battery either way I would imagine. The reason I'm giving this system five stars probably say more about how good it is than anything else. But I pretty much expected as much. I'm sure by now you can go online and find more detailed reviews for the gaming system, but in case you're wondering here, this one comes with the system, two gray joycons, two attachments to turn each joycon into its own controller, a base to connect both joycons into the formation of a singular controller, the required cables, and the Switch dock. So you'll probably want to buy a few things alongside this such as an SD card for reasonable storage space, a pro controller for a more standard controller experience, maybe a dock sleeve to prevent the possibility of scratching the screen from insertion and ejection of the system, an online pass if you plan to play any games with online features... just basically a lot of things that would be nice if they came with the system itself. This will inflate the price further, but the thing here is that this is going to replace the old models of the Switch and simply make this the main one manufactured now. So... basically, if you want a cheaper Switch you'll want to get a Switch Lite and this one will still cost about 300 bucks like the 2.5+ year-old original variant still costs. That is, unless you want to go used. I'm only bringing up these points because while this is a great system, I do think you should be aware of what is likely to happen with prices and availability going forward and plan accordingly. Once I realize a Switch was still going to cost the same if I wanted the ability to do on and off TV play I decided I might as well just hop on board with this newer variant. I'd recommend you do the same as it has had tweaks to make it just a slightly better version all around than the previous model. Otherwise, if price is a concern, wait for the Switch Lite and see how it tickles your fancy. Also, here's tip. If you want to turn the system off as opposed to leaving it in sleep mode, simply hold down the power button on the system for a few seconds and then a menu will appear with the option to restart or shut down. Also note that you cannot play on the TV off of the Switch's battery power. The dock needs to be plugged in for the dock to function. I hope something in here was helpful.",1/5/23
"It has its pros & cons..but more pros! I bought the Switch a few months ago and now that I’ve spent some time with it (more than I’d like to admit ^_^) I wanted to leave a review.The Switch has many pros over other consoles, it’s main pro being that it’s a portable console with games that previously are only found on PC or console. I am a PC gamer and my PC is an absolute beast with an 8700K & 2080 Ti BUT the reason I bought a Switch is because oftentimes I am out and about and can’t bring my big honkin’ PC with me. Obviously I prefer my PC but it’s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and then  when I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly “Switch” to the Switch and continue my game.There are some absolutely AMAZING games on the Switch: Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Witcher 3, Splatoon, Super Smash Ultimate, etc., which are worth buying the Switch. This is especially true for people with kids as most of Nintendo’s big hits are kid friendly. You may not want your very young children to play violent games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with Splatoon 2 only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they’re splattering paint all over each other.However the Switch also has its cons. Let’s start with Nintendo’s “E-Shop”. The E-shop sells games that are WAY overpriced. They charge $59.99 USD for games that have been out for years. The fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on Amazon AND you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too. Not so with digital games.Then there is the price. Yes the Switch is $299 which is cheaper than Microsoft and Sony’s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play (Pro Controller, SD card, Screen Protector) the cost adds up quickly.All in all though I do recommend the Nintendo Switch. It’s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it’s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence, drug use, sexual situations, etc., that are in a lot of other games.5/5 Stars",1/5/23
"Incredibly Disappointed Bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. Received it in December and it ran fine until mid-February when it just stopped displaying to the TV (the same TV we have used multiple times before, with no issue). The console also would not charge or connect to the dock, but charged on the power adaptor just fine. Tried to connect it to two other TVs to no avail. Tried using another dock and it still would not connect. I called Nintendo Customer Service and went through some troubleshooting procedures, including the apparent issue with cables needing to be plugged in, in a certain order, which blows my mind that, that could even be an issue with a modern day console. None of the troubleshooting resolved the issue so they set up a repair order and I shipped it ro their repair facility. I finally had it delivered back today and it looks to me like they replaced the power adaptor, dock and console. Same exact issues as before. The console still does not connect to the dock and the dock does not connect to any TV. I even tried a few different HDMI cables, including the one that came with the Switch, and still nothing. The TVs have no issues connecting to the Xbox, PlayStation and PC that is with each of them, so how the Switch struggles, I have no idea. It amazes me that I even have to have all this hassle with a console that hasn’t even been in our possession for THREE MONTHS.I will be seeking a refund for the console and all the purchases made on the account. With the amount of time and money I have wasted on the Switch, I could have just bought an Xbox or PlayStation that would be better all around. Only nice thing about the Switch is how mobile it is.Incredibly disappointed with the product. Which is odd to say because I used to love the old DS systems.The customer service Reps I spoke with were very kind and as helpful as they could be however.The customer service Reps also let me know that when purchasing a Switch through Amazon, the warranty tied to the serial number on the console does not get activated for some reason. So make sure you register your console if bought through Amazon.",1/5/23
"Great for younger kids or mobile gaming. This is, strangely enough, the first portable system I have ever bought in my 30+ years of gaming. I’ve actually bought 2 Switches so far. The first one was a Christmas present for my son who I was trying to ease into video games. He loves it. After him having it for a year and me occasionally playing it to help him through areas where my greater experience with games could help get through certain areas, I was tempted to get one for myself to play when I had long periods of downtime at work. When Witcher 3 came out for the switch, I bought another one for me and have been playing it a few times per week since.My experience with the console is pretty much strictly in the handheld mode. I bought a Satisfye grip and case for my switch which allows me to hold the system more comfortably than I would without it. Holding the standard system and playing for more that 20 minutes or so causes my hands to cramp. The small joycons are just too small for adult male hands to use for long without some discomfort. I’m fine with that since the small size makes the system easier for kids, like my son, to use. A regular controller can be a bit bulky for a grade school age kid to use well. With the case and grip, this system is perfect for me to throw into my vehicle at work and forget about it until things slow down when I’m waiting for a call. Then I can break it out and pass the time in style.All in all, I have no complaints about the system, my son loves it and uses it constantly. I like it for its portable nature and surprising computing power. It is the first portable system I’ve experienced that didn’t feel like a downgrade or gimmick. The Switch instead feels like a true portable version of a larger console like PS4 or XB1. I still play on my PS4 far more than I do the Switch, but I can’t take that system to work and play in the office or car. If you have young kids, or a desire to game on the go with something better than your phone, then it’s hard to go wrong with the switch.",1/6/23
"Love the Switch - A Casual Gamer's Best Console This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)).So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while.I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings.So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime).Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.",1/5/23
"Elegant compromise between handheld and console In terms of raw horsepower (CPU, graphics, whatever) the Nintendo Switch is far behind the current generation of consoles like the XBox One.  But, the Switch is a unique device.  As a handheld, it is quite powerful (the latest iteration nearly doubles the handheld's battery life, addressing the Switch's greatest weakness).  This allows you to play the same game on your TV and keep playing it as you take it out with you --- a unique ability.Most importantly, there is a staggering array of software available for it.  Software is what makes or breaks a console, no matter how good it is.For example the Zelda game ""Breath of the Wild"" is a visual stunner with a huge open world.  And this is the first portable system that has the full version of Skyrim available for it (the reason I bought it --- a high quality port of Skyrim with the 3 add-on packs).  Nintendo has also done high quality ports of other gems from older consoles such as ""Mario Kart 8"" as well as a lot of new titles such as ""Super Smash Brothers Ultimate"" or ""Luigi's Mansion 3"".In addition,their digital store has a lot of quality indie games such as Stardew Valley.Also, if you purchase the Nintendo Switch Online membership ($20/year) Nintendo also gives you a large selection of NES and SNES classic games.  The membership is worthwhile for that alone.Basically, because Nintendo is ONLY selling the Switch as a current console (the 3DS is on its way out), all of their best software goes to the one console.  And that gives developers strong incentives to bring their best titles over as well.If you want a wide variety of games, the Switch is a good choice.  If you want THE best console graphics or performance, obviously the Switch isn't for you.",1/7/23
"Such a cute switch! I love it! I couldn't believe my luck when I was able to snag one at MSRP after the release date. It's so cute! I like the design of this one much better than the other switches, and the dock is adorable, especially if you're an Animal Crossing fan. And it's the newer version with improved battery life, too! I was thinking about getting a switch for a while, but the lack of games I absolutely had to have and the colors (I'm not a big fan of the standard colors/designs) put me off. Animal Crossing solved both of these problems with ACNH and this amazing special edition.My only complaint (other than how difficult it was to get - finally caught a restock in the middle of the night and even that sold out in less than 5 minutes) is that sometimes one of the joycons gets stuck when trying to remove it from the strap. It's probably just an issue with mine in particular, but it does make it kind of annoying to remove. I have to put some force into it, and I'm sure that one of these days, I'll accidentally scratch myself trying to remove it. Otherwise, it's very cute, and at MSRP, I'd definitely choose it over the other colors!PS - I hear that this version is restocking, at least in Japan, so absolutely do not buy from scalpers! When I was hunting for this, there were at least 100 being sold by scalpers for ~$500;  now there are just over 20 for $750 each. It's cute, but it's not worth making a scalper $400+ off of other people's desperation. Just wait for a restock, or buy a regular switch and put a skin over it.",1/7/23
"Won my sisters heart! Alright so since the Covid-19 outbreak has officially ruined my sisters senior year she had started getting into animal crossing. After playing on the I Phone app for what felt like forever she decided she wanted to transition to a game on the 3ds console. Since she had started playing animal crossing new leaf she fell in love with the series. So as her big sister I had decided I would get her this limited edition themed switch in hopes of helping with her depression as well as to cheer her up for her senior year being ruined. Also so she could get a taste of Animal Crossing new horizons for when it comes out March 20th, 2020!  The day I told her I purchased it she hopped with joy. I was excited too considering I was sharing my own excitement for animal crossing with my sister. It had finally arrived. Its box didn't come in damaged and the console was packed safely to prevent possible damages. It works perfectly as any nintendo switch should with no defects at all in the console itself. The only concerns I have to remind future buyers is that the joycons will stop working properly after a year of use. This is coming from my own nintendo switch experiences and other fellow switch owners where the controls will drift randomly while you're trying to play a game after a year after consistant use. So I'd be best to invest in a second set of controllers just in case.All I have left to say is that this was indeed worth my money and my sister couldn't be happier with her early senior graduation gift!",1/7/23
"Be Patient! I got this Gray version of the Nintendo Switch after a few months of hunting for retail price $299. There's a couple of websites out there that will notify you of in-stock. I happened to be able to grab it off of Amazon, but GameStop, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, etc, also have them as well. With it being in stock is rare, so you just have to look and be patient! Plan a few months ahead for birthday / xmas gifts so you have time to wait for a retail priced stock is in. Enough about the INSANE price gouging....I am very pleased with the Switch and am very happy with it. I have played on it for a week so far and everything is working fine and dandy, as it should. One gripe is that the storage capacity is small so only a few games can be played at a time, but with a micro SD card, possibilities are endless. I ordered one of those, and expect it soon so I can expand my downloaded game collection. I've enjoyed the Switch so much I'm getting some additional joycons and a grip and a charging station. I'm going to continue looking for accessories. Maybe a case I also had to get a TV adapter because my old TV only has one HDMI port, so I had to RCA to HDMI it up in order to not unplug and replug my Roku every time I want a bigger screen. How that goes is yet to be determined.I'm still figuring out how the dock station works (TV debacle), but for the most part - no complaints! I haven't played it with more than one person yet, but I'm positive that runs smoothly as well!",1/7/23
"Nintendo Switch w/Grey joy cons V2 HAC-001(-01) This review is for the Nintendo Switch w/Grey joycons, V2 HAC-001(-01). I've owned the original Switch(HAC 001) and recently, the Switch Lite(Turquoise). Battery life wasn't so good with the original Switch and only a bit better with the Lite. This Switch model has improved battery life, up to 40% depending on brightness settings, volume settings, and the type of game you're playing. Another thing I've noticed is if you download digital games, it takes less time. The graphics(colors) seem to be more vibrant.If you're a gamer who likes to play games on the T.V exclusively, this would be the perfect choice. On the other hand,someone who enjoys gaming on the go, might find it cumbersome carrying this console around. It won't fit in your pocket. Just something to keep in mind.Lastly; if you buy plenty of digital games, a micro sd card of 32-128gb is a must. Another basic necessity would be a glass screen protector, as the plastic screen does scratch easily. There are two models, one with the grey joy cons and one with the red and blue joy cons. The Switch with the red and blue joy cons seems to be the rarer model and is sought after by gamers for it's resell value. There are plenty of games available for the Switch, something for everyoneand more to come. If you have your old Switch, it isn't really necessary to upgrade to this newer model. However; just for the improved battery life, I would recommend it.",1/7/23
"Situation Better than You May Think First of all, I wanna say that although Amazon may have some date when they say it will be in stock or some date when they say it’ll be delivered, just know that it may be earlier than anticipated. I ordered mine thinking it wasn’t gonna be here until  around June 4th, so about 3 weeks to a month after I ordered the switch, but fortunately, it came 2 weeks earlier! Apparently, I’m far from the only one who has experienced this, and a number of people have gotten their switch earlier than expected, so don’t look at the date thinking that’s when you’re gonna get it, ‘cause you may just get a nice surprise like a number of customers did. Yes, there are some stock issues with the switch at the moment as well as some production issues, but they are not as bad as they’re made out to be, so if you are thinking about getting the switch, go ahead and pull the trigger! Also, DO NOT BUY FRON SCALPERS. As some other people have mentioned, they will buy a switch and then sell it for a greater price than needed in order to make a profit, and although it may be tempting to buy from them so you can get it sooner, it is so not worth paying the extra money when the situation is actually better than amazon makes it out to be. Don’t do yourself a disservice and fall into the instant gratification trap. Be willing to wait a little bit longer for your switch. YOU’LL BE GLAD YOU DID.",1/7/23
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CONSOLE!!! I am not one to usually leave reviews on anything, but I just couldn’t pass up letting people know how awesome this console is. I have always loved Nintendo since I was a child. I had a 3DS & a Wii that I played religiously. I quit playing video games as I got into my late teen years, but my friend recently got a Switch & it encouraged me to dive back in. Let me start off by saying within 10 minutes of the Switch arriving, I already had it set up with my account connected and hooked up to my TV. So the setup process is a breeze. I put in the first game I bought for it, Mario Kart 8, it downloaded very quickly and it was like reliving my childhood all over again. Graphics are amazing and everything loads smoothly. The dock that comes with the Switch to connect it to your TV doubles as a charger for the device itself and the controllers. I bought an extra controller for it and all I had to do to connect it was use a USB cable hooked to the dock and plug the controller in. One of the biggest perks of this device is how you can alternate from handheld play to screen play. At home and wanna play games on your TV? Switch — Going on a flight and wanna have something to keep yourself entertained? Switch — All in all, a solid, quality device for a fair price. You won’t regret, nor can you go wrong with purchasing a Switch!!!",1/1/23
"Not Impressed I expected a bit more when it came to the Switch and I was a bit let down. First of all, I feel like the design is counter-intuitive especially the docking system. I don't understand why you need to place the entire tablet in-between such a cramped space where you could accidentally scratch up the device. There are so many bells and whistles that snap on and off it becomes rather annoying just to play a simple game. You can scratch up the joycons just by sliding them into the joycon grips. Why did you design it that way? The kickstand on the back of the Switch is a joke. It's so hard to open and isn't long enough to support the device. Also since, the power cord plug is directly under the device, you can't plug it in when you're using the kickstand. So many design irregularities and inconveniences. Fifty million buttons all over the place, which means fifty million ways to play one game and hold the controllers. It's so chaotic and annoying. Fun features such a streetpass and an internet browser are not on this device. This device still isn't powerful enough to compete with Playstation or Xbox. Just playing this device in your hand is a struggle because it is so freaking huge and weighty. I wouldn't buy this for a child, they can stick with the 3ds. To be honest, I had more fun playing on my 3ds and vita than the Switch.",1/8/23
"The Versatile and Fun Nintendo Switch: A Must-Have Gaming Console The Nintendo Switch is a fantastic gaming console that offers a unique and versatile gaming experience. The ability to play both at home on the TV and on the go in handheld mode is a huge plus, as it allows for gaming anytime and anywhere. The Switch's Joy-Con controllers are also a great feature, as they can be used separately for two-player games or attached to the console for handheld play.The Switch's game library is impressive, with a wide variety of games available, from first-party titles like ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" and ""Super Mario Odyssey"", to third-party games like ""Minecraft"" and ""Fortnite"". The Switch also has a growing number of indie titles which are also worth checking out.The Switch's online service, Nintendo Switch Online, is also a good value, offering access to online multiplayer, cloud saves, and a growing library of classic NES and SNES games.Overall, the Nintendo Switch is a great choice for anyone looking for a versatile and fun gaming experience. It has a great selection of games, and the ability to play both at home and on the go makes it a great option for gaming on the go. The only downside might be that the battery life could be better, but overall it's an excellent device.",1/1/23
"This switch saved my marriage.. for now. This is my second purchase of a Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing edition. I was bummed out when my wife took my switch hostage claiming it for herself to play Animal Crossing, especially since Monster Hunter Rise had just come out. I was even more bummed out because I had missed out on buying the MHR switch edition because my rationale mind decided I didn’t need a second switch. I was left with 2 options, leave my wife & fight for custody of the switch or purchase another during the shortage brought by on by the epidemic. Surprisingly after a few months of contemplating my decision the switch prices went back down to an affordable price. It still wasn’t easy finding a switch in stores so I took to the internet where I was surprised to see a brand new switch going for regular price. I quickly added the item to my cart & purchased right away! It was delivered with upmost care like a stork bringing me a new baby. Everything was brand new, I was taken back to a simpler time in my life, opening presents on Christmas day. Finally after a quick software update I could play MHR months after its release! Little to my surprise my wife quit playing Animal Crossing shortly after I got my new switch because she went down Korean Drama rabbit hole on Netflix..",1/7/23
"Love the ACNH switch Call me crazy.....I bought the original switch a while ago and never played Animal Crossing before. When everyone was talking about New Horizon during the start of the Pandemic, I thought to give it a shot. Boy, I should not have done it :) I started spending all my free time paying off my loans to Tom Nook, hunting for villagers and trying to decorate my Island. Like many, I got kinda bored after everything was unlocked and got tired of the Villagers repeating the same over and over again. I thought of resetting my Island, but didn't want to lose everything I had worked for so hard. Then Nintendo announce to release the ACNH special edition switch again and beside I didn't like the idea of buying another switch, it was a great opportunity to start another Island with an ACNH themed switch. Anyway, I didn't regret spending another $299 - the switch is VERY cute and fits perfectly on my shelf. Beside still having my old switch with a developed, but basically abandoned  Island I mostly play on the new ACNH switch now. I know it's very hard to reset your Island, but if you don't have the money to buy another system, you may want to consider it. Starting from scratch actually  does bring a lot of the lost magic back.",1/7/23
"One of the Coolest Gaming Devices I’ve Owned The only time I’ve used a Switch has been playing on one that my friends own. Just these experiences has really intrigued me into getting my very own Switch. I love playing video games and I own an Xbox and PS4, so I figure at some point it was time to complete the trifecta. While I’m more of an Xbox person, I will say I am very impressed by the Switch. It is a very simple console, but genius in of itself. I’ve had some Nintendo gaming devices here and there. A SNES back in the day, but mostly their portable ones from the Gameboy to the Advanced to the DS and 3DS. The Switch combines that of a home console and a portable gaming device and for that I love it. I can put it in the dock and play it on my TV. I can play it handheld which will be great for road trips or maybe just wanting to play anywhere. This was a brilliant move by Nintendo and it makes the Switch really stand on its own.Now what I’d say my favorite thing about the console is it’s simplicity. This device is made for one thing only and that is for playing video games. The console is both modern and old school at the same time. Would definitely recommend to anyone who really likes Nintendo and their games.",1/7/23
" “can’t miss” for the casual gaming household Our household doesn’t buy the latest, greatest gaming systems but it was time to upgrade our original Wii for another family friendly system. The reviews were pretty glowing for the Switch and I can say they’re warranted. Just make sure you buy the newer generation (this product) so you have better battery life and less decline over the life of the product.I love how Nintendo the Parental Controls essentially live within an app on the parent’s phone. A motivated kid can hack just about anything so keeping these settings non-local is a brilliant little safeguard. My kids have to ask me for “more time” when they’ve hit a daily limit (which is customizable for the day of the week). It’s very much like a simpler, more reliable version of Apple’s Screen Time feature on iPhones. Of course, you can also unlock more time on the switch itself using a pin code.It’s also worth mentioning that Nintendo did a great job with the “user assisted driving” feature on Mario Kart that helps young kids and inexperienced gamers be competitive. It really is nice to bring my youngest daughter into the joy of Mario Karting.",1/7/23
"It’s good. Expensive, but good The titles and controls are too expensive for this platform. I really got this as another gaming option beside PC for more accessibility and Group fun. However, the individual joycons as controllers are unmanageable for most people I’ve tried to play with. I looked into buying more controllers to have more people play at the same time, or to give two-player sessions more comfort, but it’s just ridiculously expensive. Clearly, the remotes are not actually worth near what they charge for them. But when you add the little thing that you put the joycons in to make them a single controller, and a charging platform for the additional controllers, you’re looking at well over $100. Maybe I should have done more research. But for this amount of money, I could have set my pc up to double as a living room local-play gaming console and pay for BOTH AAA games AND low price indie games. It would have put me in a better position to start paving the way to a VR setup down the line.Setting all that aside, the quality of the games is good, the quality of the hardware is good, and the unique wired-to-handheld gimmick is nice.",1/2/23
"Product is great! Resellers... not so much! TLDR: Product is SO CUTE!! BUT doesn’t do anything special compared to a regular Switch (other than give 10/10 on aesthetic) so don’t buy unless you can afford it/the look it worth it to you.Long review:This product is amazing!! The pastel colors are so cute and the texture on the back adds a great extra touch. The dock has an AC graphic on it which was a great addition tomy living room! The packaging is also well thought out leading to a great unboxing experience. Of course this works exactly like every other Nintendo switch, so this is entirely about aesthetic.With all of that said, the price gouging on this product is insane. Because it is a limited edition the reselling price is crazy, and because it does nothing a normal Switch can’t do, so purchasing this is a novelty. If you have the cash to drop go for it (I was lucky enough to get one at the normal price). But as I was hunting one down when they were first announced, I watched people buy them up and list them at inflated prices before it even came out. So maybe consider if you want to give those people your money.",1/7/23
"Great! Slight problem. Amazing Console/handheld device! Don’t crap on the product in reviews but crap on the scalpers! Most of the reviews for switches that don’t work are probably people who’ve bought from 3rd party.I bought from SHIP & SOLD BY AMAZON. It came with little dust and packaging particles but I believe it was just from the warehouse storage that got into the hole the box has. I’ve been playing multiplayer for 2hrs now and it works perfectly fine! If you can wait, don’t buy 3rd party and do AMAZON. Totally worth it and really, really cute! I bought it MSRP btw ($299). No overpriced, scalped switch!Shipping: I bought it as a pre-order for the next month. It changed to arriving next week to this Sunday for me! There’s a chance it will be the same for you too! So if you can wait, be patient, look out for pre-orders (they are available every now and then) & buy it MSRP ($299)! It’ll be worth it!UPDATE AFTER 1 DAY:Just found out 1 vent on the back of the switch is loose and your able to push it in. I don’t know if this will be okay but review looses a star for this :(. Works great but slight defect.",1/7/23
"Tons of games to choose from Great system.  My son owns one but has it with him at college so I decided to get one for myself and I must say it's got such a huge selection of games.  I still have my 3ds but didn't realize how much Nintendo had expanded on game selection and variety. I'm a huge animal crossing fan so I bought this version of Switch since I played the first one on the 3ds.  Their online eshop, accessible through an online connection, has an almost endless selection of games.  You can buy physical copies or digital copies of games and some are digital only through the eshop.  As a longtime gamer (I own a PS4 and original owner of a regular NES I bought in 1989), I can honestly say this is Nintendo's best system since you can play it on your TV but also take it with you (portable) like a 3ds.  You can also play games on it offline so you don't have to always be connected to the internet.  This is a console that is great for all ages of people, young or old and when I'm tired of hack and slash on my PS4, the Switch has many chill titles of games to relax with.  I'm 52 and enjoy mySwitch a lot.",1/7/23
"Beautiful Switch - Definitely worth the buy if you can find one Definitely love how bright the colors are on this switch, more of a neon pastel shade. The switch is the V2, which has extended battery life and a more efficient CPU. Comparing this switch the the V1, the IPS panel has a warmer tint whereas the V1 is much brighter. Though color values do vary across switches. The joycons themselves are more of a matte finish on the coating rather than the glossy feel on previous joycons. The colors match well with the dock and will definitely stand out by your TV. The dock itself is a bit wider compared to the V1 allowing more wiggle room to prevent the switch from being scratched, though I do recommend purchasing a glass screen protector. The pattern on the back of the switch definitely gives it an ""animal crossing"" feel to showcasing. They did a really good job in making the pattern stand out compared to previous special edition switches.Overall, pretty happy with having a new switch that stands out and has a longer battery life. Will definitely be a well-used switch in the coming months.",1/8/23
"Brand New Animal Crossing Edition Switch for MSRP For anyone looking to get an Animal Crossing Edition Switch without paying more than retail price, my advice is to be patient and check back here frequently. At random times, a few consoles will be restocked and available for MSRP (thank you to the other customers in the Q&A who tipped me off about this!). Just a couple minutes after coming across that advice, I refreshed the page to test it out and this is exactly what happened. Originally it said it would take over a month to arrive but I ended up receiving it less than a week later. Just make sure the listing says ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" to ensure it's not a third party seller and that the price is exactly $299.99.In terms of the product itself, I had already been playing on another Switch for a while and it's a great console (aside from the infamous joycon drift issue). My preferred play style is docked on the TV but it works perfectly on handheld mode as well. The Animal Crossing edition is super cute with its pastel joycons and ACNH-themed dock, I highly recommend it!",1/7/23
"Fast shipping and great packaging First things first I got my Switch from Mums Collectibles & Stuff so this will mostly be a review of them as I've already owned a Switch and knew what to expect from the system.What most people don't realize is that consoles are in high demand this year (2020) and we all know the reason so I can't fault a company for increasing the price on item due to high demand and low stock of said item. That being said Mums Collectibles & Stuff is by far the cheapest I have seen a new switch go for on amazon, ebay or a number of other websites.On top of all of this one I bought the item from them they had it ready and shipped the next day as I did buy it rather late at night. With an estimated arrival time of 2 weeks I actually received it a week early which I give my thanks to UPS. When I opened the package I found they took the time to make sure that the switch was secure and safe with two layers of massive bubble wrap which was just extra enjoyment.All in all they are the cheapest, quickest and most reliable source to get a switch right now.",1/7/23
"Incredibly fun! Can also use parental control to track playtime and protect console from siblings I bought this just to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and it didn't disappoint in the least! It's incredibly fun!One cool feature is that if you set up Parental Control using the free app, it will tell you how long you've played each day. Since I'm neither a parent nor do I need to be controlled, I disable restrictions and play-time limit so it doesn't actually interfere when I'm playing, but it is a bit sobering to see that yesterday I played for 6 hrs and 40 min.Also, if you set the play-time limit to 0 min everyday, the console will prompt you to disable Parental Control via a PIN. This could come in very handy if you have a sibling or roommate who likes to steal your Switch.I would also recommend getting a screen cover, either plastic or glass. I have a glass one that adheres like a second screen and haven't had any trouble yet, but then again I've only had it for 8 days and treat it very carefully.Overall, a great product, and worth every penny!",1/8/23
"My son likes it My nine-year-old son saved and worked in order to buy a Nintendo Switch. He bought it with his own money and I couldn't be prouder of him. We bought the Animal Crossing edition only because it would have been available earlier than the standard version. He said he didn't care how it looked as long as it could play Switch games. Originally, Amazon delivered a completely unrelated package and said it was the Switch, but their customer service sent the replacement as soon as the issue was reported. Kudos to Amazon for that. My son has only used it in handheld mode since there isn't a TV available for his use. He has never placed it in the dock so I don't know how that would work. We've had it for a couple of weeks at this point. Here is my son's review:I like it. It's been good so far. Its most impressive feature is the battery life. One charge can last for six hours of continuous gameplay. It also charges more quickly than any other device I've ever had. It goes from around 4% to 25% in 10 to 15 minutes. I'm happy I bought it.",1/7/23
"One Year Later as a Switch owner I’ve had my Switch for about a year now and I can say it’s a very fun console. It’s no where near as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox but the fact that I can take my games on a road trip or play it at home is pretty awesome and convenient for gamers. The Joy-Cons do get loose however over time and will slide off without having to press the release button so I would recommend getting a grip or a case like the picture shown above. Another thing I wan to mention is the joy con drift, which can get really annoying at times. Having to calibrate them in the settings menu every other minute can be really annoying and for others, ruin the experience. I usually use a pro controller while playing on docked mode and I don’t run into any issues but the problem persists when I’m playing on table top or handheld. Besides the minor inconvenience here and there, I think the Nintendo Switch is great, especially with third party games like Skyrim or the Witcher 3 being ported over to the Switch. It’s a great little console.",1/7/23
"Beautiful console, reasonable price. This system is so beautiful and I got it for not too much more than the actual retail price! On top of it all I received it within days of ordering, picked it up early from the post office and I’ve played it at least once a day since owning it. The fact that it’s the updated version of the Switch with a better battery life means I can play longer on the go, and I don’t think a review of this version of the console would be complete without mentioning the gorgeous Animal Crossing New Horizons designs on the box and dock. The dock is completely white as opposed to the standard black, and features adorable artwork of Tom Nook, Timmy, and Tommy on a deserted island. The joy cons being a pastel green and blue instead of the neon I’ve grown accustomed to with my parent’s Switch is a great contrast. All in all this is a system I’d highly recommend if you love Animal Crossing and definitely something for a collector to pick up along the way! 100% my favorite special edition version of a console!",1/7/23
"Very beautiful, i almost shed a tear. Okay so this is going to be a review with my overall experience. Yes, it was overpriced, I think this was worth it, I personally got it for the Joy-cons, and I don't regret it, because you really don't know when you will get the opportunity to get one for less. Anyways, arrived in perfect condition, first switch ever, the only thing that was wrong is the Left Bumper on the Joy-con, which i don't know how to explain it but kind of loose, more than the Right Bumper. It bothers me because of something on the inside, and also since I paid a lot for this switch but not enough to complain, its just something i'll have to live with. But besides that, it was a great experience, the bumper was the only thing that gave me a fright since it feels very weird. Now I don't have anything to play since my game doesn't arrive until Wednesday, but just downloading free games is fun, but originally there is only 25gb so I would recommend getting a micro SD, but i think that's all.",1/8/23
"BEST B-DAY PRESENT EVER !!! We bought this for my 7-year-old son's birthday & he couldn't be happier!! This is by far the most adorable Nintendo switch console out there!! I definitely recommend purchasing it.We bought it when it was $300 plus tax. I do not recommend paying any more than that price.. just wait till it gets back in stock & buy it for $300. Do not purchase it from greedy scalpers.. keep an eye out because as soon as it gets in stock it sells out usually the same day! We are so fortunate we were able to get one in time for my son's birthday ..we purchased this back in October & held on to it till December for his birthday. If you want one for Christmas, I doubt you will be able to get one at the $300 price ..unfortunately it's sold out till mid January.. but if you can I say go ahead & get it! This thing is adorable & really is a great collector item for any Nintendo fan! Even if they aren't into animal crossing. It is a very unisex design. I believe it can be for a boy or a girl. 👍",1/7/23
"It's everything I could've ever dreamed of and more. I had experience with the Switch since my family had a shared one for a while, but sometimes you get tired of passing the console around so I got one of my own! I'm so glad I was able to get the New Horizons one because it's so much cuter in person and as an avid Animal Crossing fan since the 2001 Gamecube release here in the west, it's just so good. It took a while since this design is so popular but when I finally caught it during a restock period I knew I had to grab it!I love the color scheme, and seeing Tom Nook with Timmy and Tommy on a lil' island is so precious <3 The all around aesthetic makes it feel like both a console and an artpiece dedicated to your new journey on a deserted island.If you're a big AC fan who can afford to get it and you're able to grab one when they're in stock, I'd say to go for it. Nintendo most certainly knew what they were doing when they made this design because I had wanted this Switch since day one.",1/7/23
"Device not registering MicroSD Playing the games on this, has been fun and my son loves it....However, I've had this for SEVEN days, and I already have to send it into Nintendo for repair because the Joycons make a noise when using them, and the Switch does not register there is a MicroSD inserted. The internal device storage is terrible. And I had to even buy an additional MicroSD card to make sure it wasn't the SD card even though that SD works on my Nintendo Switch Lite, both SD cards do, but neither work on this Nintendo Switch. And if it's an issue that Nintendo cannot fix, they will only replace it with a used one that meets the requirements of a new one, even though the one purchased was brand new. The controller parts don't fit tight into the Switch, and the buttons don't always register when you push them so sometimes playing games is frustrating cause you push a button, and it doesn't work. Overall disappointed. Should have gone with a Playstation or Xbox.",1/7/23
"Just buy in a store!!!! I dont ever leave reviews but this is something else. The switch came and works everything is there but theres literally a blue line across the entire screen and is so annoying looking at it and seeing it while playing games. After three hours of being told to only return like i finally got one after being sold out for forever, they finally are going to just replace it but still have to wait two months for a replacement cause guess what? Sold out already! Thats better than not getting one at all though. Just glad after talking with 4 people they finally listened to my point of view. Really annoying and frustrating. Never buying electronics online again. Espically not from amazon.Edit: i got a replacement and the screen is actually not broken this time. Would still buy in store because of how hard it was to even get a replacement but i got one so thats all that matters. Console is great when its not broke and it is beautiful.",1/7/23
"Beautiful Special Edition! I got to admit, I was a little ticked off at Nintendo that the day this switch arrived at my doorstep, they announced the OLED Switch.That being said I am VERY happy with this purchase!  This console is beautiful and is a very nice upgrade to my launch day Switch that died last month.  Throw on a couple of pretty cases to help protect this and you have an amazing set up on your hands.  Nintendo has always made high quality consoles and special editions like this Animal Crossing Switch help showcase that very well.  Now even though the OLED was announced as well, it looks like the same specs just with a better screen.  Very nice for those who prefer handheld mode.  I use mine in the dock most of the time so I didn't really need that.TLDR: If you want a really nice Special Edition Switch then don't be dismayed by the OLED announcement.... the Animal Crossing console is very nice and well worth the money. 👌",1/7/23
"10/10 Recommend This is my third switch so that I can have three Animal Crossing islands because I’m insane, also I have severe ocd - same thing I guess?, and I am absolutely in love with the AC theme. I have a different style/color for each one so I can tell the islands apart but this one is def my fave. The Switch is my console. I have played a couple of games on ps4 (Atelier games that weren’t out on Switch until more recently), but now that those games are on Switch I will get them as soon as they go on sale. I love the handheld option because I can play while my husband watches something on our tv, and I love that it can also be docked so I can see things on the big screen. I play mostly handheld. It plays smoothly with the joycons and a pro controller. You can even play with a pro controller when it’s not docked if you don’t want to/can’t use the joycons. I’m sorry about the novella. It’s just enjoyable and I recommend it.",1/7/23
" love it I originally bought a Nintendo switch lite because this console was sold out everywhere and I desperately wanted to play Animal Crossing during this pandemic. I would literally check every month (since April) to see if maybe a store had this in stock, but sadly at the time, it was only third-party sellers selling at a huge markup price.By October, I decided to check one last time hoping that someone was selling at a decent price and to my surprise Amazon and several other retailers had this back in stock! Bought it right away because from my understanding this was supposed to be a limited edition item and didn’t want to miss the opportunity to own it.Got it in no time and I love it. It’s such a pretty color. It came around a good time since a lot of Switch games have gone on sale for the holiday. I still solely use my switch lite for Animal Crossing, but use my new switch for all other games.No regret purchasing it.",1/7/23
"Nintendo Switch #2 Here is what happened. I already had a Nintendo Switch but I didn’t play with it for a few months so when I wanted to use it it had no power. I put it on the dock to charge and nothing. I thought it was dead forever so I ordered a new one from Amazon. Later I went to see if my old Nintendo would power up after I charged it. What I was not doing is pushing in the power button enough, after I pushed the Nintendo powered up. So now I own 2 Nintendo’s. It’s great to have 2. This new NS works great just like the old one. I could care the less about the game Animal Crossing but I like how the NS looks. Also there was waiting time if I wanted the exact one I have. Over all the NS is great! In fact I like it better then Sony play Station or X-box I don’t even play them anymore. I love it I can play the old games from Nintendo and others. The first game I played was PONG back in the day. Nintendo Rocks!!!",1/7/23
"Awesome and Beautiful Nintendo Switch console It's good thing that was able to get Nintendo Switch for $299.99 few weeks ago and it arrived this week. Beautiful Nintendo Switch- Animal Crossing: New Horizon Special Edition console.It looks awesome with colors and design, and it works excellent at my home. I like that they have few free to play games and that they have SNES and NES games from Nintendo E-Shop. I can't wait to get Animal Crossing game someday. Hope they Add more free-to-play games on Nintendo Switch, add Twitch streaming app, and more apps for gamers, and be able to use bluetooth devices and console controllers with bluetooth.Hope they make more awesome and beautiful special editions designs and art Nintendo Switch consoles in the future and with 4k/8k graphics, audio, and UHD quality.Overall awesome console to own and have with my other different home consoles to play with my family and myself.",1/8/23
"The cutest! Needless to say, the Nintendo Switch is so much fun and a great way to kill time.  But on top of that, this particular console's Animal Crossing theme is just the cutest I've ever seen.  I never liked the primary-looking colors of the OG console, so the soft blue and mint green joy con colors really appealed to me.  The back of the switch itself has rivers and islands etched onto it as well!  It's the little details that really make a difference for me.  The dock is a light cream color with the raccoon travel agents on the bottom right.  I'm so glad this set was available again because, although I'm sure I'd be happy with the OG console, I'm so much happier with my Animal Crossing edition.  It makes me smile every time I see it.  I've never even played the game before I bought it, but it ended up being my first game purchase and it makes me even more happy that I bought this edition.  I love it!",1/7/23
"Really lives up to the hype. I couldn't afford to purchase this video game system for a good few years since money was tight while I was attending college. But, after saving up over the course of a few months, I became the proud owner of a Nintendo Switch system last year. And I gotta say... it really lives up to the hype.Being able to switch (no pun intended) between gaming on the TV and gaming in portable handheld mode has been a very nice, convenient gaming experience indeed. For example, it lets me take the game with me if I suddenly need to head into town with my family and I don't want to wait until I come back from town to continue my game. The games run very well and it gets great internet reception too (most of the time).I'm not sure I've ever had this much fun playing video games since Pokémon Ultra Moon on the 3DS. I'm definitely glad I ordered this game system. Very satisfied.",1/5/23
"Nice customer service I've had the light for a while, but it started drifting and playing animal crossing with a drift is no fun at all. Especially when u can't switch out the joycons I also wanted to start my island over so it was about time to get a new switch. As I was looking I was so lucky to see the animal crossing special edition back in stock and not at a scalping price. But at the normal price of 299.99, but when the first package was delivered it got stolen because Amazon delivery didn't know, customer service at first had an aditude with me. I had assume they didn't believe me that it was stolen. But it was and at the end of the day. Im so grateful they were able to replace the console with out Me having to get my money back because I saw that the price instantly jump from 299.99 to 360.00 which I would never recomend buying it at that price.",1/7/23
Best Nintendo Switch for $299.99 but Avoid Scalpers!!!!! This is the best switch for this year  I bought is at original price of 299.99 which is a great deal for this special animal crossing edition  worth the money  as you can see in the photos and video of unboxing everything is there and brand new I cant believe I have it. It was sold out everywhere but now thanks to my dad I have it for Christmas eve  when we open the gifts I Am so ecstatic and excited for Christmas eve thanks Nintendo for the best switch ever but it does not include the game  but that's ok because I already have it but if you are going to get this for your kids or for yourself for family fun avoid scalpers I hate them they suck also if you want  buy the switch and game itself it is a great game and I guarantee you will have a blast playing it,1/7/23
"Love my ACNH Nintendo Switch *_* We're Aussies living in Germany right now where the Animal Crossing Console ist still sold out so we bought it on Amazon US from Widget One LLC. Just make sure its a genuine company not a private person. We got the console for not more than the classic Nintendo Switch would cost including import fees and tax. We even got some import fees back from Amazon. And what can I say, I'm totally happy with the new Switch. Love the special Joy Cons, the special AC painting on the back and the special Animal Crossing Charging Station. I even got a Message in game from Animas crossing about the new special Joy Cons. The Animal Crossing Switch has the already new battery build in. I totally recommend to buy the switch if you're an Animal Crossing fan and don't have a switch already.",1/7/23
"The Nintendo Switch The Nintendo Switch if a one of a kind console or one might say a ""Handheld Console"". It is compatible with 3 different options which let you play by yourself or others on the go. Or the classic Nintendo way is to plug in it on the TV and play away.  People might say that it's not great and it's very small and does not process as well as the New Xbox X or the PS5. But it's not supposed to be like that. It's meant for the Nintendo games. You can't play any Mario game or Pokemon game without the switch. Every other console can't compare. There's a reason why it was never in the console wars. It doesn't have any competition in its class. It is by itself and is very unique. That's why I think the Nintendo Switch is one of a kind console and is very worth buying.",1/7/23
"Lots of fun and takes up very little space I've been wanting a Switch for a long time, so I finally went ahead and bought one; and it's been a lot of fun playing with it. I thought the controller would be a little awkward to play with, but it's easy to get the hang of. The only thing I can say is that it's not as ergonomic as an Xbox or even a PS controller, so if you're playing for long stretches of time, your hand will cramp up.I think that the biggest plus for me is how small this thing is - the entire console isn't much bigger than smartphones nowadays, and the games for it are half the size of DVDs. If you're fine with the limited game lineup and just want a console to kill time now and again, this is a great option. It's also not a big commitment space-wise.",1/7/23
"BEST NINTENDO CONSOLE! I've always loved Nintendo and every console that they've made but this one, really makes it to the top of my list! It's portable, light-weight and, pretty thin. Also, Amazon has a ton of cute cases to choose from so that you can bring your console for when you're on-the-go. The buttons feel comfortable to the slightest touch, everything feels smooth. Even the joysticks and trigger buttons have no resistance so there's no need to press them too hard. Easy to set up, there's a shop on the main menu for you to purchase games straight from your console and you can find people online to play with for your favorite Nintendo Switch games. I seriously love my Nintendo Switch and, everyone should get one today!",1/7/23
"Good Buy‼️ I purchased this system for my 3 year old son. It arrived earlier than expected brand new in the box. Although Animal crossing is to advanced for my son, ie. he can’t read the subtitles, I play the game and I love it. ( I’m 41) haha but you won’t be disappointed with the purchase. I also purchased a few other Nintendo switch games and enjoy them as well. One recommendation I would pass on is “not” buying the actual game cartridge but buying the downloadable version as you won’t worry about losing the tiny cartridge as my son did, but we later fixed them, I was upset at the thought of $60 dollars going down the drain as I should have bought the download so I wouldn’t have that issue. Enjoy ☺️",1/8/23
"Love the animal crossing design and the pastel colors for the joycons! If you're an Animal Crossing fan, then you'd enjoy adding this to your repertoire of consoles and games. I bought this last year and gave it away to one of my family members, but then I ended up missing it and decided I wanted it back, so I went and bought myself another one. I guess someone else must have really liked it too because unfortunately it was stolen after a few months of having it; now I have a 3rd Animal Crossing Switch console, and I love it so much. Definitely spend a good amount of time playing Animal Crossing New Horizons, Mario Kart 8, Fire Emblem Three Houses, Final Fantasy X/X-2 Remastered, etc. 110% Recommend",1/7/23
"Broken R button after 2-3 years of use Got this for Christmas in 2020, So I’m going into my 3rd years of using it, I just noticed that my R button was broken in half and don’t even know how that happened. It could of broken because of anything but you’d think since is only been using it a full 2 years that it wouldn’t break. I am very careful with it and have rarely dropped and usually have a case on it while in handheld mode. I’ve had some trouble with buttons but nothing that is too bad. I wasn’t expecting the R button to break like that though. It’s seems like it broke in half it still works but it’s not pleasing to the eye and is upsetting cause it just bothers me that it doesn’t look right.",1/3/23
"Left joy con controller stopped clicking.. just got it 3 days ago brand new Shipping was fast and on time, delivery guy was super nice as well. I got my switch never used, brand new and only had it for 3 days, the left joy con “left stick” won’t click. Im playing breath of the wild and I need that button to crouch in order to sneak in the game. Absolutely ridiculous that it stopped working that fast and I’ve been taking good care of it. I should have bought warranty with it and that’s my mistake I guess... But if anyone knows how to fix that I’m willing to do it myself before bringing it in to someone or buying all new controllers for it.",1/7/23
"Works Perfectly A large majority of the negative reviews are people complaining about the price when this product was being price gouged in 2020, but let me tell you, it’s a perfectly good price now.  System is sleek and easy to set up, making it a very stress-free situation.  Everything is well documented so that you can have the easiest time setting up your console.  Personally, I got the AC switch and it’s absolutely adorable!Only grief I have is that the console came a day early so I have to just let it sit for a day until I get my case, screen protector, and other games. Not the fault of anyone though",1/7/23
"Good, but problems The Nintendo Switch itself has worked ok. I am having issues with it not wanting to turn on today, but will come back to adjust review after I have done some troubleshooting. The problem I have with this one is the Japanese charging cord was included in it with the adapter for US. The adapter is loose and won't charge correctly. There were zero instructions on how to use this. I'm not sure that the charger even works (it keeps falling off the wall outlet because of the loose fit of the adapter). It would have been nice to have had the proper charging cable on something I paid $300 for.",1/5/23
"Great system overall The Switch is a great, versatile system. I bought one for my son two years ago for Christmas, and has gotten solid use for both of us. I went ahead and bought one for myself. The multiplayer games are un matched, Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Bros. The list of stellar multiplayer games goes on and on. For bang for your buck this is a great buy. Is it top of the line? No. Nintendo consoles are unique, and do their own thing. You won't be dissapointed, and neither will your kid. I bought him Miko 3 this past Christmas and guess what, he would rather play Switch.",1/1/23
"Stuck on logo screen I was really excited to buy this since I had a DS as a kid, but when a bought it a day later it was stuck on the logo screen. I tried to find solutions on the internet on how to fix this and I even tried sticking it in a freezer as a last resort. Still doesn’t work. It’s been 5 days I think? If it works I’ll let you know but honestly I’m really upset, it was expensive only for it to be unfunctional 1 or 2 days laterEDIT: it started working again I don’t know what exactly fixed it but I’m going to wait a while to see if it does it again",1/6/23
"Fantastic console. I bought this to upgrade my n64 and gamecube and although I was hesitant at first to buy it because the gameplay was almost identical to their legacy titles, it was a fantastic investment.  The console is much smaller to pack, the graphics are better, and it switches between a handheld device, a device you can setup on a table with 2 people, and a regular console you connect to a TV.  This is a truly timeless device that will always have value till the day I die.  You can use it for self entertainment or family game nights.",1/1/23
"Super cute Animal Crossing theme Got it for my sister-in-law for Christmas. She loves it! My brother bought her the Animal Crossing game to go with it, and she is totally infatuated!I have the original version, from when it first came out. My only complaint is that the dock quit charging. It still connects to the TV, just won't charge. Also, if you play Skyrim on it, everything is really dark. You have to brighten in system settings, and even then, you will need to use the ""Magelight"", or ""Candlelight"" spell to see dark areas.",1/4/23
"My favorite game!! I was planning on getting the new switch to play Animal Crossing on the big screen. My friends bf mentioned how there’s an Animal Crossing switch addition. I could not tell you how fast I was searching for this to be in stock somewhere. When I seen Amazon had it, I absolutely had to buy. Love everything about it. The silhouettes of the islands and villagers has to be my favorite. Anyone who has an Animal Crossing fan of their own or they themselves are huge fans, should absolutely get this hot buy.",1/7/23
 Nintendo Switch Review. So far I have no major complaints about the console that would stop me from using it. I don't have a home or TV so I can't say whether or not there are any problems connecting to a TV but I don't see why there would be. I am a fan of The Legend of Zelda and Metroid so I just have to have this console. There was the appearance of a half dollar sized spot under the screen that caused concern but after I removed the screen protector it disappeared. Like with any purchase anywhere use caution.,1/4/23
"Super fun! Love the colors! I love this system it takes some getting used to compared to the other consoles I have but nevertheless it's fun.  The only issue I have is the fact that my brand new console came with a scratch on the left joy-con.  I don't mind it, but I am just writing about it to let the company know that they should check their items before selling them to make sure no one else receives a slightly damaged product.  All in all I absolutely adore this system!  Thanks!",1/6/23
"Fun for everyone I'm so glad I bought this I have 3 children  14 , 9 , & 5.  2.  girls & a boy. We all have so much fun playing the different games together.  I also love the diversity of the controllers & game play. One of us can play on the TV or take it on the go , or all of us can play together  on the big screen  . It's so small & easy to set up I put all the stuff back in the box for safe keeping whenever we arnt playing it since it only takes 2 min to set it back up.",1/7/23
"Kids love this!!!!! My grandchildren had one switch console and were constantly fighting over who got to play first, so I bought this second one and they just love playing together now.  It charges up quickly and the battery lasts for days.  We took both switches on a vacation and the battery stayed charged until we got home 3 days later.  The games are all age appropriate and keep them entertained for hours.  This is one game system everyone in the house can enjoy.",1/7/23
 bit of trouble but worked out in the end This is the second one I had to order. The first one came defective and the charging dock was not working. Had some dust as if it was used before. It wouldn’t connect to my tv. It was my kids Xmas gift so they were sad when they couldn’t use it. I returned it waited about a week before getting a refund to re order. Once I received the second one I connected it and right away it transmitted signal to the tv.,1/7/23
Awesome system but battery life isnt great This is my first ever switch its a awesome system love it my only problem is that the battery only lasts a few hours so its always on the charger which makes it kinda lame as a handheld on the move not sure if its all or just the one i got has a bad battery but it be nice if it lasted atleast 8 + hours either way i recommend it.  it is one of the best game systems ever developed pretty ingenious,1/7/23
"Wife's Favorite Birthday Gift My wife absolutely loved receiving this as a birthday gift! She has been playing it a lot, because it's easy for her to use it while nursing our newborn daughter. The Animal Crossing decal on the Switch is really good quality and everything else about it has been great.There's not really much else to say, I mean, it's a Nintendo Switch. It is a really great console with lots of fun games to chose from!",1/7/23
"Item was late but as advertised and in good condition. While this item did arrive on 11/21 instead of 11/18 per the order, the item was as advertised and in good condition. The tracking provided was not helpful as it listed a lot of dates with “arrived at carrier facility” and “departed from carrier facility” no locations of any of these facilities were ever listed so I never knew how close it had come until it was delivered late.",1/5/23
super cute!!!! amazing!!! i love this nintendo soooo much!!!!! it is so cute and works just like all the newer ones! it came a week after i ordered it so really fast shipping. i was afraid it would get damaged during shipping but it was in perfect condition!! no regrets buying it!! if you are looking for a nintendo and you love animal crossing this is perfect!! even if you don’t like animal crossing it is still super cute!!!,1/4/23
Ehhh I got my switch used in good “very good condition” but when I put it in the dock after about 10 minutes it starts to make the tv screen flicker on and off and then eventually shut off I’m not if it’s the switch or my tv but I do have an Xbox connected as well and I do not have that problem with my Xbox so just be cautious buying from people who say it “works well” and if anybody knows what’s wrong please reply thank you,1/7/23
"Fun Just really like the ability to go from my TV screen to portable, don't gotta power down the device to do it, transition pretty quick, don't gotta shut down the game you are playing or anything. I am about 6 years late but with all the games on the store kinda surprised at lack of games actually interest me, but got enough to keep me satisfied and be able play fortnite easier when travel instead of packing my PS4.",1/3/23
" wonderful Valentine’s Day gift After reading the bad reviews from other buyers to the seller I was very worried about getting a refurbished console. What I get is a brand new Hong Kong version console and I don’t mind the console version, I am very happy with it. The downside is that this game console does not include the animial crossing game cassette, so you will need to purchase an additional one:)",1/2/23
Too many technical issues for only having had this 2 weeks We got this for Christmas a couple weeks ago and we consistently have had issues with the controllers. They would just go out randomly and we would have to reconnect. Not a huge deal just annoying. Today one of the controllers is just not being detected at all. For a brand new $300+$50/game console this is a problem. Poorly made cheap plastic.,1/7/23
"Came in packaged nicely with everything included. I was nervous to order a switch online as it’s expensive and the risk of damage but in my area they were sold out.Came in quickly without any issues, packaged safely and tightly. Had all the items it said were included, along with extra packaging when it came in. I’ve had mine for about 3 months now and I have had no issues with the switch or joycons.",1/3/23
"It is alright I have owned a Nintendo Wii and a Wii U and now the switch. The games I have: TMNT Cowabunga edition, Monopoly, Risk, Trival Pursuit and Super Mario Sparks of hope are good with excellent graphics and are fun to play but THIS IS NOT A BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE CONSOLE!  Also, the controllers are very small and can become uncomfortable to the hands after very long gameplay.",1/2/23
Mom vs. Child I bought this for my four year old but I think I been enjoying it more. We have been having a ball. I’m not huge on game systems but this is the perfect game system. From traveling and being busy i love that it goes from handheld to home console. Even when I can’t stop we can download games on the road on the system. It’s the perfect game system for the WHOLE FAMILY!,1/5/23
"Well worth the price. I play this an embarrassing number of hours every week. I love the design and I play on it often. Too often but what can I say? I love gaming. Great for handheld or playing with others on the big screen. would certainly recommend this to someone who loves playing games either alone, with family, or, if you purchase the online package, with complete strangers.",1/8/23
"Pricy . did not come with any games i like the features of the product .i like that it can be used on my Tv as well as a portable game . The games selection is great , however , it did nto come with any games laoded . i  had to spend an assitonal $60 just for one game . i woudl at least expect a gamign console to come with at leat one game considerignt hat this costs $299",1/7/23
"Great for a gift! My boyfriend bought me an animal crossing switch because he lost a bet, and I just couldn't see him without one, so the next day I got him a Switch and he was so happy to have one too. I know that it was a stupid impulse buy, but to be honest, it was worth it, I kind of play everyday, and he too so.. It would be a hassle to share just one switch.. xD",1/7/23
"Awesome I absolut3ly love the fact that it's not like the original switch colors. My daughter is extremely jealous because she got the original colors. The only thing I didn't like is that it wasn't made clear how to transfer save data from one console to the other. I thought I had transferred it correctly, but ended up having to start my game over because of this.",1/7/23
"Great switch, be sure to read the description first. Great switch.  Works well and does what it should.Was a little disappointed it does NOT include animal crossing, it just features some of the graphics...which you will pay extra for.  Had I known that we'd have gone with the standard colors.Outside of that overall happy with product.",1/6/23
"If you are a Nintendo fan, go for it I bought the system in order to play Nintendo's exclusive titles and I've been enjoying it so far. Maybe the only negative comment that I have for the system is that sometimes (very rarely) the joysticks get disconnected for no reason and the gaming experience is paused until they reconnect again.",1/4/23
"Really happy with purchase My son has been saving for a Nintendo switch for some time and was excited to be able to purchase. So far he has only played the free games online. He is 10 years old and loves it, easy to use, looks great. Good size, easy to use controls. Looking at online membership and games. Definitely recommend.",1/4/23
"Not a bundle!! Just an expensive paint job. No game included Was a gift from my granddaughter and she loves it, but she was devastated when it came without the game. I had to go to WA to the evil empire store and spend another $70 to get the actual game. Don’t call it a bundle if it’s just a special edition paint scheme.",1/4/23
"It's fun, $300 is the most you should pay though Had my switch since 2020. I don't personally use it a whole lot, but it is a good fun portable gaming console to have with you when youre out of the house. Battery life is decent too. It's good for kids who have good motor skills. It's not good for kids who are clumsy.",1/8/23
"Great little machine It’s been a while since I’ve owned a Nintendo, I’m normally an Xbox guy, but I’m super glad I’ve got this baby now. Huge dose of nostalgia plus portability, that’s awesome. Package was in great condition and so was everything inside. It works perfect now but I will update if anything changes.",1/7/23
"Love the Animal Crossing Colors! What can I say....its a Nintendo Switch! But the fact it has the Animal Crossing colors is a nice touch. The Switch has worked without issue since its purchase. While it does not see heavy used, it is used most days. I don't regret buying this edition of the Switch at all.",1/8/23
So beautiful! This switch is so beautiful! I’ve never seen one in real life before and it was so worth the wait! So far everything is working and I love love love it! No photos I can take will do the details or the beautiful colors justice! This was definitely worth the money spent and retail therapy!,1/4/23
Lots of Fun! I bought the Nintendo Switch for my grandchildren for CHRISTmas. It was easy to connect to my TV. Learning to use the controllers was a a breeze. The grandkids really enjoyed playing as well as my adult children. There have been no problems with it at all. I would buy it all over again.,1/4/23
Its a good system Im not a fan of the switch and prefer the original WII however my kids love this and have played on it a lot. They like that they can take it with them and not be confined to just using the TV. It was a good purchase and has never given us any issues. Ive had it almost 2 years.,1/5/23
Fun for all We love our Nintendo Switch. With winter on its way I know we will love it even more. My family lives a few hours away so its fun to be able to play games with them from afar. My husband and nephew were even able to play it together on a road trip we went on. It helped pass the time.,1/7/23
Great game system! Easy to set up! Great gift for our 8 year old. Love that we can set up to the tv and all the games u can get to go with! Charging is fast. And can be shared easily. You can buy extra controllers and more people can play on the tv! Such a cool little game system!,1/5/23
"loveee it no complaints about this order. it came to me brand new and nothing was missing. i love the color, it’s like how it is in the picture. i’ve been playing on it like everyday 😭. it doesn’t come with animal crossing though…i really only got it for the colors anyway lol",1/2/23
Works great daughter loves it I was concerned because it didn't arrive in it's original box but it works fine daughter loves it more than the switch OLED ..I just wish they would specify when something isn't coming in the original box but other than that..item is excellent 👌,1/5/23
My Brother loved it!!!! The item came well packaged and was not broken! It looked like it did in the pictures. It turned on and had no issue setting up. It was a gift for my brother for Christmas. He is very ecstatic about it! It works great! Thanks for a great product.,1/5/23
Great Product! The Nintendo Switch is such a great product. I bought it for my girlfriend who loves Animal Crossing and she plays it daily. She used to get mad at me for playing video games but now we can enjoy them together and spend quality time together.,1/1/23
" year later still good I bought this Nintendo, switch special edition for my youngest son’s birthday a little over a year ago still plays it’s going strong, and he’s pretty rush on stuff. This was his second personal gaming device the lite being his first.",1/5/23
"Nice device but After one use the R button broke.  My daughter was so upset and I think I paid too much for, I should get a percentage refunded to me. Do you know how difficult it has been to find replacement joy-con that match? I haven’t found one yet.",1/7/23
"My daughter loves it She’s been playing it all the time! Great to have games to go. Not sure what it has that her iPad doesn’t, but she seems happy. We got this because her brother moved back home into our media room which negated her access to the xbox",1/7/23
"Love it! I haven't had a video game console in a couple of years. I decided to try the switch. I am really enjoying using it. It is a lot of fun. Even though I'm out of practice using controllers, this has been very easy for me to pick up and use",1/3/23
"Cute, had to replace my old one What is with Nintendo and their batteries??? Had my old switch since launch and then the battery started to expand🤦Got this one to replace it lol what is funny is I don't play anima crossing😂 but it is cute👍🏻",1/7/23
"adorable everywhere console super cute design with so many awesome games available. I recommend the switch to everybody who is interested in gaming! plus this design is so adorable! and portable!!! easy 5 stars, I use mine every day.",1/8/23
We absolutely love this So many ways to play for all ages. It allows the user to download games. Parents can block certain functions while monitoring your child's usage remotely. Kind of pricy but was able to pay in installments.,1/5/23
"It's arlight Overall the console was easy to set up and very fun to play games on. But when downloading games it takes up too much space. And when buying more space it's very expensive. But besides that, it's very easy to use.",1/2/23
Expensive for refurbished Didn't realize until it was already purchased and in use that it is refurbished making it difficult to get any repairs.Silly to pay full price for a refurbished device!Otherwise works as expected,1/5/23
" waited for this moment Wait several months, I think years, for the Nintendo Switch to be at retail price ($299), the product arrived completely new and with the box with all the integrity.Yes, buy it, but at retail price",1/7/23
 love this so much! I had the gray version that came with mario kart 8 previously with an ex boyfriend but he took it so decided to get a new one and loved this one so much. Came quickly and my boyfriend uses it a lot!,1/7/23
"LATE but worth it. Nothing wrong with this. Just if you order it, usps is shady and they ""lost"" my package. Suggest sending it to a Amazon hub or locker. They finally ""found"" it hiding. And box was open. So yeah.",1/5/23
" love it, but not a lot of storage Personally when I was downloading games, the space fills up fast to where you are gonna have to buy games, but other than that it is a great addition to my console collection!",1/3/23
