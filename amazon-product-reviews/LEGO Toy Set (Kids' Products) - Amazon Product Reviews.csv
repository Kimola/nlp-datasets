"March 8, 2025","Great starter set for anyone getting into Lego‚Äôs. Easy assembly, it‚Äôs Lego. Very good capacity with room to store a lot more legos."
"March 6, 2025",I bought these for our grandsons to make Lego tables for them. They were the perfect size. The boys have so much fun building with them. They like the sets that are in there with instructions to build many things! Great toy for young minds!
"February 24, 2025","Great buy, good variety"
"February 15, 2025",I got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves all the different color legos and pieces. There is a great variety of pieces that gives creative options. I do recommend getting a large baseplate to have something to build on.The box is large and serves as a great storage container with room for more pieces.
"February 13, 2025",Standard box of Lego bricks.  Decent variety of shapes and sizes.  I'm not such a fan of all the different colors; I would prefer sticking to just a few colors and providing more bricks of those colors.  But that's my preference and I understand why Lego expanded the color choices.  Otherwise the set includes enough bricks to spark creativity for kids and should keep them occupied for an hour at a time.  It certainly did for my kids.
"February 11, 2025",My son build whoa Lego sets so quickly - this is a great set for letting him be creative and build his own designs!
"February 6, 2025","My son is ADHD and ODD. He struggles with focus and following directions / listening to anyone speaking with authority.Legos have been a major tool we have used to teach following directions in a non-abrasive way. They also allow him to not only follow directions and feel proud of what he accomplished but the opportunities are endless. He can build something specific or create something new.He cannot and will not sit still for ANYTHING else, but Legos keep him occupied long enough for me to actually get things done while also helping him learn and use his imagination.The cute container is also a plus. We have these on display all over his Lego themed playroom and he is even doing them with his little brother now. We keep adding new colors and sets to the collection. Some stay built on display, others get built over and over again. Great for all ages (after they stop putting everything in their mouth, the pieces are definitely a choking hazard)"
"February 4, 2025","Such a colorful set all the hues of the rainbow , including neutral colors. The amount of blocks that come with the set doesn't fill the container , yet there's plenty room to add more and it's great for storage either way . Came with all it's pieces and packaged neat."
"February 1, 2025",As a child I also wanted legos but my mom couldn‚Äôt afford them! I was very surprised when my daughter wanted legos so I didn‚Äôt hesitate to find them for her! I decided to buy her this as a starter and I must say it exceeded my expectations! Not only does it come with your standard Lego blocks but it comes with cool building and more as well! She plays with them everyday and they are easy to pick up and clean because the container dubs as storage when finished!
"January 27, 2025","It came with so many legos, and it was nice that it came with some instructions so you could build things! Great for my kids! Great quality!"
"January 27, 2025","Great value , great price , boys love them"
"January 27, 2025",My son has a blast playing with his legos makes me think of when I used to play with mine as a kid
"January 22, 2025",We won the birthday party with this! Great value; tons of blocks for the price and includes a storage container. It also includes an instruction booklet that kids choose whether or not to use.
"January 22, 2025",My son has had fun building all of the various builds found in the instructions.
"January 21, 2025",My 7 years son loves it
"January 16, 2025",Hours and hours of fun for our 4 year old. My husband might spend more time building with it lol
"January 15, 2025","Paired with their app (so you don't have to keep track of the book), my kids and I love playing with these. These large box options are perfect for your kids creativity to explore and build random things, like my sons robocroc lol. The box will only be a quarter full so you can combine other box sets like we did."
"January 15, 2025","One box provides literally years of entertainment, and this is a great mix of different pieces to compliment any LEGO sets."
"January 13, 2025",Keeps him busy fort a entire weekend of rain and snow
"January 9, 2025","Its a generic starter lego set not much more to it. The legos are seperated and organized by colors with plastic bags in the box so you dont have to worry about it being an instant mess. Its perfect to get your kids into lego building, and you can tap back into your imagination to show them how its done."
"January 7, 2025","The kiddos were a little disappointed that the box isn‚Äôt entirely filled with legos. It‚Äôs a fairly large box that‚Äôs only maybe 30 percent full.This does however leave room for whatever they build if they don‚Äôt want to disassemble it immediately when they‚Äôre done playing, or additional sets of legos that don‚Äôt have storage options."
"January 6, 2025",It was a Christmas gift for my great-grandson and he loved it. He is seven years old.
"January 6, 2025",Classic legos with a tub that has room to put more in! Very happy with this! Adults and kids alike have been playing with these! Love the clear pieces and variety of pieces it comes with. A good amount of pieces too!
"January 5, 2025","Has all the fun pieces, my kids love building with these!"
"January 5, 2025",My grandson loves building Legos and he opened his eyes and was so surprised it was beautiful thank you again
"December 30, 2024",My niece and nephew loved these for Christmas
"December 30, 2024",I would give it 5 stars but seems like it should've came with more leggos. But my daughter loves it and plays with them almost everyday making stuff out of them. So 4/5
"December 29, 2024",What else is there to say? It's a big old box of blocks from Lego. They do what they are supposed to and come in a large variety and a nice holding container.
"December 29, 2024",Large these appear to be just normal size Legos. There's nothing wrong with them as Legos but they are not large.
"December 27, 2024",Got it for my grandson for Christmas  he loves playing with them
"December 27, 2024",love Legos. with Legos the possibilities are endless
"December 26, 2024",It was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it
"December 26, 2024",It comes with a load of legos.  What I like most is when you buy more legos there is more than enough room to add them to this box.
"December 26, 2024","The best way aside from garage sales to get your hands on bulk Legos.  This set is a great value, and has the typical Lego quality (can confirm that the smallest pieces WILL send you to the emergency room where they can remove the piece under anesthesia).Not great for hungry infants."
"December 25, 2024","This was the perfect gift for my 7 year old grandson who lives building with blocks. There are a huge assortment and blocks are separated in individual bags by color. There are instructions to make certain things and plenty of blocks to use your imagination .Also to make it event better , nice  carry case included!Perfect gift if a boy or girl ."
"December 25, 2024",Great toy for boy or girl.this is going to be a Christmas gift for my great grandson who is 5 a and 1/2 years old.
"December 25, 2024",It is ideal to play with my grandson. We stay busy for hours making things
"December 25, 2024",I bought this as a gift for one of the children of Jefferson Barns. He was so excited to open it up!
"December 25, 2024",Son loves it! Comes with an idea book. Love how the container also acts as storage.
"December 25, 2024",As expected. Came with two idea books. Every color was individually wrapped. Great for gift.
"December 24, 2024",These were a perfect gift for grandson who just took interest in Lego‚Äôs!
"December 24, 2024",I bought these for my son and he loves them.
"December 24, 2024",5 yr old great grandson loves the ability he is building something. Instructions are easy to follow.
"December 24, 2024","I like this set, its a lot of fun. My daughter and I build everything in the fairly limited guidebook and have moved on to user-created designs on Rebrickable. The only thing that sucks is, the set is missing large bricks. They fit lots of teensy-weensy pieces in to pad out the piece count. It's a bummer.My daughter is still pretty young and unable to play with this set much on her own. On top of the bricks snapping together she has to worry about clips and joints and little onsie-twosie pieces that take a fair amount of motor skill because they demand heavy pressure be applied to a very small surface area.I'm thinking this would be ideal for a 9 year old, but younger kids are going to have difficulty. Just know you won't be using many of the bricks you're buying and that they sell lower brick count sets with more larger pieces.Have fun!"
"December 24, 2024",All my grandkids love Lego‚Äôs and with this box the possibilities are endless!
"December 23, 2024","Legos can be very expensive these days, and I wanted to get my son a good set with a storage container (very important piece) so we would not end up with Legos everywhere. The storage container is super helpful, the Lego variety is great, and it suited his age well for just wanting to build things on his own."
"December 23, 2024",Nice container for storage
"December 23, 2024",Classic toys & Lego is great‚Ä¶. But this is what the box looks like. My kid saw it on our porch & it blew his bday surprise. Yayyy
"December 22, 2024",Great and clean and ready to use
"December 22, 2024",Best price per brick i found
"December 22, 2024","Looking for hours of fun with bricktastic brick play, then this Lego essential is a must have for your family. One of the best purchases I have made, found this great deal on Amazon and glad I did such a variety of bricks and endless building ideas. 10 out of 10"
"December 21, 2024",Good choice for my Granddaughters first set!
"December 17, 2024",Christmas present for 5 year old
"December 15, 2024",My niece loves Legos and really wants a Lego set.  She will be very happy!
"December 11, 2024",Cool pieces Legos
"December 9, 2024",Great price and product
"December 9, 2024",Kids love them!
"December 8, 2024",Legos are always as expected
"December 4, 2024",Arrived timely
"December 1, 2024",My kids love them I have no complaints! ‚ù§Ô∏è also comes with two booklets with piece by piece how to build some things.
"November 29, 2024","Hours of joyful fun for our 4 y.o. ! Cute colorful constructions, easy to put together."
"November 24, 2024",My nephew is 4 and has a builder‚Äôs mind. This is a perfect starter set for him to get into LEGOs.
"November 24, 2024",Kids love being able to free build with all the colors
"November 23, 2024","Very cheap for the cost of Legos nowadays, but all pieces were there, and the kids are happy."
"November 21, 2024",This set gives you tons of Leggo pieces to use with other Leggo sets Great find.
"November 14, 2024","The picture is the biggest house I could build exclusively with ALL of the 4x2 bricks included in this set.As you can see, its just enough to be high enough to cover the minifigures head (not included), but there are not enough left to build a roof.Yes, you could finish the house with other pieces, but at this price, I should have enough 4x2's to build a reasonably sized house.4x2 bricks are the workhorse of creative building with Lego, no matter how much LEGO has attempted to market smaller, more complex and specific creations as the 'new' heart of Lego, and not buildings and houses. Any child who grew up with Lego knows its *ALL* about the 4x2.This is a 790 piece set, with only *67* 4x2 bricks.On average, most colors only have FOUR 4x2 bricks - !?The 4x2 is relatively large and expensive, so Lego sells sets with really high piece count - like this one at 790 - but uses tiny pieces no one cares about to push up the piece count. In this case, only 8% of the pieces are 4x2's....and I love Lego's response to people's complaints about 4x2's - 'hey, come to our website and buy by the BRICK' - where 4x2 pieces are $.30/pc!I don't even think LEGO *wants* to sell these building sets anymore (this set was created 'by demand!'), because the vertical sales of endless expensive, complicated *model* sets of licensed characters (like its own, or Batman, Star Wars, etc) are much more lucrative. Most of these sets aren't even buildable by kids until they are competent readers who can follow complex instructions, and once they have built it, the bricks have little or no replayability. Build the model, you're done. Did I mention these model sets seem half the size of as the picture on the box?Some of Lego's model sets are completely phoned in as well - the original Minecraft sets, for example - uh, my kids and I have played ALOT of Minecraft - the original Minecraft sets - I don't even know what they were *supposed* to look like - they looked like a mess - and, of course, where Minecraft is a game of large 1 meter square blocks, the LEGO version was comprised of tons of the tiniest pieces I have ever seen. Once we opened the box, we didn't even bother building our Minecraft set, it was so disappointing.Having bought only one other model sets other than the Minecraft one, I don't even like my kids to see the model sets in the store - because yes, the cover art is exciting and cool, but I know that the out-of-the-box experience is not. Dad will wind up building the entire thing, my daughter will play with it for 5 minutes, start taking some pieces apart, and it will be nothing more than a mess of tiny toy pieces no one plays with for the rest of its lifespan.I have talked to other parents, and Lego's strategy is a universal disappointment.Lego, the 'CLASSIC' Lego experience is having a child open their first set of legos, which is mostly 4x2, so they can build big, beautiful buildings of their own imagination. You can sell your one-off model kits, but let's see you sell at least ONE set which is mostly 4x2, and bring that core experience of replayability back to kids of this generation.I chose this set because it does contain some parts I think are important for a core set - like windows, doors, and wheels - but when I see the vast number of tiny useless filler this set has, it just makes me upset about what kid's experience is with modern Lego marketing."
"November 7, 2024","Even a couple windshields and additional wheels would have been a big deal. LEGO made this ""gender neutral"" so there are at least 8 sets of windows but only enough wheels for a single car.Decoration wise it's all pretty equal and the feminine colors are beautiful, but with additional colors you are also severely limited in building, say, a wall.This set is for if you already have a big collection, not as an introduction to Lego."
"November 5, 2024",Love that the case can be used to store the legos. My nephew was thrilled.
"October 30, 2024","These sets are amazing. Great for young and old, as you use your imagination to create cool designs and objects. Great set of Legos."
"October 28, 2024",We've had this lego box for a few months now and it is still our families favorite thing to bring out and play with. We wish there were more figurines to create - but look forward to increasing our collection with the other boxes.
"October 23, 2024","My kids love them, I love that it gives me some kid free time time! Haha They keep my five year old twins busy for long stretches of time. They are durable, bright colors, packaged nicely with the colors separated. The container they come in isn't full all the way so you can add more Legos later on and have a place to keep them all together. I thought the price was fair also."
"October 22, 2024",Bought this for a birthday gift for a six year old.  Came with easy to follow instructions for independent play.  Also good for parent participation in more creative play.  Excellent choice.
"October 11, 2024",Great toy for a 5 year old to lean with
"October 6, 2024","If you're worried about the Zombie Apocalypse, this kit is a great way to secure the perimeter of your home- just open the packages of pretty rainbow coloured pieces and toss around the floor! With 790 pieces of pure torture, anyone who has ever stepped on a lego knows this will be a very inexpensive way to keep Zombies, Burglars, Assorted Bad Guys, and any barefooted adults at a safe distance. This is also a super bargain for anyone who loves building with legos, but hates the price of those little kits-- which can cost $15 and up for enough pieces for ONE specific toy build, so ya, bargain.We gave this set to a 9 year old, and unfortunately it was the second gift opened at the party...and mom and dad had to tell him to put the legos down and open the other gifts. He did, but immediately went back to the lego set and *everyone* at the party (all the kids and one of the dads) just spilled them out on a table and began to build things. So yay for me - first time I've brought the best gift!Now, the S I Z E of the bucket (adorable btw) is roughly 14"" x 10"" x 7"" -> which, after you open all the little bags with all the really pretty rainbow coloured pieces and dump them in, will look rather ""wah waaaaaahn"" if you know what I mean. (LOOK at the photo and understand that the rainbow row of pieces is what you are getting - the toys are an *example* of what you can *make* -not additional pieces, so disappointing at first unless you KNOW what you are getting.) But there are seriously 790 pieces in there and the bucket has enough storage space left over that the mom was very HAPPY to go get the other legos they had and dump them in the ""CUTE NEW LEGO BOX!"" (It looks like a giant lego) The kit comes with an instruction booklet for 3 toys to build and a link to online instructions for about 4-5 more toys. I am pretty sure you can go on pinterest and other sites and find all sorts of free patterns, so wahoo for those folks who make things and share freely.BOTTOM LINE: If you need an impressive fun INEXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU'RE GETTING gift, this is it."
"October 4, 2024",This is great when kids come for a visit.
"October 4, 2024",My great granddaughter loved this Lego set. She and her grandpa played with it for a long time.It was a birthday present for her 5th birthday..

"September 29, 2024",Can't go wrong with legos. Pretty decent amount of pieces for the price. I like the reusabe lego storage bin it come in.
"September 27, 2024",Got this for my grandson so he could what he wants not a predetermined set
"September 13, 2024",Nice big storage bin. Lots of pieces. Lots of projects or room to expand your imagination. My seven year old son loved it.
"September 3, 2024","Love this set, it allows my students use their imagination and they had lots of fun. I had an issue with the post office delivering the package and the seller was very helpful solving the issue."
"August 13, 2024",Me and my 5 years old son have a lot of fun with this Lego
"August 5, 2024","I purchased these Legos for my 5 year old grandson‚Äôs birthday and he loves them and has already constructed a house all by himself!  My sons, aged 55 and 57 years old, loved playing with Legos when they were young!"
"July 23, 2024",Good Product All Around
"July 23, 2024","Another great LEGO product! The set was a great price for the number of LEGO pieces included, and I always love the yellow bins for decorating and organizing our LEGO space.The variety of pieces was great, and the instruction book included many different builds (scooter, camera, bear, house, etc.)."
"July 13, 2024","A lot of the basic pieces you need to create pretty much anything. A good supplement to all the specific sets that you buy. The set comes with some pretty great design ideas, as well. My 7 year olds were thrilled."
"May 16, 2024","‚ÄúBuilding Memories: A Lego Adventure‚Äù is a heartwarming testament to the timeless joy of Lego.

"November 8, 2023",I am just trying to figure out how to keep all these pieces organized in some logical and easy to use way...
"August 22, 2023","This product offers so many little brick pieces, and so many things that you can make. My daughter is absolutely obsessed."
"April 21, 2018","You can never have too many Legos! Perfect assortment of colors, shapes and sizes. Easy to use!! Very durable! Fun for all ages!"
"March 5, 2015","We bought two of these because our main lego bucket was looking a little sad. I thought these would be great but I underestimated the quantity. We have 4 kids and two adults who all love lego and we really need a larger refill option of extra pieces. That being said, it came with a ton of color variety and size/shape options. Very pleased...just need more."
