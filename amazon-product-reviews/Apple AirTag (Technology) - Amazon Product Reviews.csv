"March 17, 2025","I’ve been using the Apple AirTag for a few weeks now, and it has quickly become one of my favorite gadgets. Its compact size and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem make it incredibly convenient for tracking important items like keys, wallets, or luggage.What I Love: • Easy Setup: Pairing the AirTag with my iPhone took seconds, and the instructions were simple to follow. • Precise Tracking: The “Find My” app provides accurate directions and even shows the exact distance when I’m close to the item. • Durable Design: The AirTag feels sturdy and well-made, and the battery life has been excellent so far. • Peace of Mind: I’ve already used it to locate my misplaced keys once, and it saved me so much time and stress.This is a fantastic product for anyone who wants to keep track of their belongings effortlessly. Highly recommended for anyone in the Apple ecosystem!"
"March 17, 2025","These are great to keep track of items that you need to find.  I have on my keychain, in my luggage and one is in my wallet.  I even have one that I have in a dog collar for travel in case of an accident or escape.  The issue with putting on a moving object is that it is not real time, it is delayed so it just gives you a general idea of where the moving object is.  I primary use for objects that I tend to misplace a lot.  I hit the find function on my phone a lot for my keys and it sends out a beeping sound and I go right to them.  Highly recommend as a economical way to keep track of those easy to misplace items."
"March 16, 2025","The Apple AirTag is a useful and straightforward solution for keeping track of my belongings. Setting it up was quick and simple—just a tap to connect with my iPhone, and I was good to go. Its sleek and compact design makes it easy to attach to items like keys, bags, or even my wallet.The location tracking is precise, and the Find My app provides a clear view of the item’s location. When I need to locate something nearby, the Precision Finding feature is especially helpful. It uses haptic feedback and on-screen directions to guide me to the exact spot. The sound the AirTag emits is also loud enough to hear from a distance, which makes it easier to find items when they’re buried or hidden.The battery life is impressive, and the AirTag uses a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery, so there’s no need to replace the whole device when the battery runs low. It’s also water and dust-resistant, which adds to its durability for everyday use.While the AirTag works well for finding nearby items, if it’s far out of Bluetooth range, it depends on the broader Apple network to help locate it, which works most of the time but isn’t quite as immediate as I’d prefer in some situations.Satisfaction with Packaging: The packaging was secure, and the setup was straightforward without any issues.Likelihood of Recommending: I would recommend the AirTag to anyone who wants an easy, reliable way to track their belongings.Price Reasonableness: The price is on the higher side for a small tracker, but the quality and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem make it a worthwhile investment."
"March 15, 2025","The Apple AirTag is exactly what I needed. It’s simple, effective, and does its job without any fuss. Here’s why it works:Why It’s Great:✔ Super Reliable – The tracking is spot on. Whether it’s attached to my keys, bag, or pet, I can find it with ease.✔ Easy Setup – Just tap it to your phone, and it’s good to go—no complicated setup.✔ Compact & Sleek – It’s small enough to be unobtrusive but still noticeable if needed.✔ Works with the Apple Ecosystem – Integrated seamlessly with Find My, so I always know where my things are.It’s an AirTag—plain and simple—but it works exactly how you expect it to. If you need a tracker for your stuff, this is the one!"
"March 15, 2025","Despite having a dedicated place for them, I cannot keep up with my keys. I specifically bought an AirTag to put on my keychain so I can find the darn thing. Yayyyyyy, ADHD. Anyway, it's made by Apple, so it's wonderful quality and integrated seamlessly with my iPhone and iPad (and I'll probably see if I can link it to my iMac because I'm constantly misplacing all my things all the time). I like the AirTag's size and I know it's durable because it's made by Apple. The accuracy is great; every time I have lost my keys, my AirTag leads me to them pronto."
"March 15, 2025","my boyfriend, literally loses his wallet every single day Well lost his wallet every single day until I bought him this AirTag. I got him a wallet with a AirTag slot on it and ever since then he hasn’t went a single day without it. It gives him a complete ease of finding it when he sits it down somewhere because his phone alerts him exactly where it has been left. It is super accurate and it has a battery inside that takes years to die so it’s definitely durable and worth the purchase. You can put it in your purse. You can put it in your wallet. You can put it in your children’s book bag. Whatever you want to keep up with you can place that AirTag on it or in it. Your phone also allows you to play a sound from your AirTag if you lose it and it is loud so you won’t miss it."
"March 15, 2025","I use air tags on all my expensive road bikes.  as long as there's an apple device that pass by my bike about 30ft away the Find My Device on my iPhone will tell me where my bike is exactly located down to the addresss.  I left my bike at a repair shop and all week the air tag show my bike was at the bike shop.  If there are no Apple device that pass by my bike then it will not tell me where my bike is though, but that would be very rare because there are many iPhone users everywhere.  Air Tag is not compatible with Android phones."
"March 15, 2025","The Apple AirTag was an absolute lifesaver on our trip to Europe! We put one in our luggage, and I’m so glad we did because our bag did not arrive with us. Thanks to the precision tracking and real-time location updates through the Find My app, we were able to pinpoint exactly where our bag was, which helped the airline locate it and get it to us much faster. Being able to track its progress gave us peace of mind and eliminated the stress of a truly lost bag.Some great features of the AirTag include:Precision Finding (when used with an iPhone 11 or later)Ultra-Wideband Technology for accurate location trackingLost Mode Alerts to notify you if your item is foundLong Battery Life (lasts about a year before needing replacement)After this experience, we’ll never travel without them again! No more lost bags—highly recommend!"
"March 14, 2025","The Apple AirTag is a lifesaver! Setup took seconds, and the Precision Finding feature makes locating my keys effortless. The battery lasts a year, and it's water-resistant, so no worries about spills. I only wish it had a built-in keyring hole, but that’s a small downside. If you lose things often, this is a must-have!"
"March 14, 2025","Apple AirTag: A Must-Have for Anyone Who Moves SmartIf you grew up in the hood, you know losing something can be a real problem.

"March 13, 2025","This is an amazing technology and worked really well tracking a package from the United States to Netherlands. We had a really expensive item that one of our relatives was bringing to the Netherlands and we were able to track it through Dublin Airport which was one of the stops and was able to continue tracking it through the Netherlands and then all the way back to United States once they were done. Wish there was a Samsung version, good thing a local relative has an iPhone."
"March 13, 2025",I bought this for my cat’s collar to keep track of him if he got out of the house.  It was always accurate showing where he was and I felt very secure knowing it functions well.  Then I borrowed it for my trip to Cancun.  When I got back and I wanted to put it in the collar again.  It was super easy to check the app on my phone to find it.  I give it great props for connectivity because it showed me that my cat was on a beach in Cancun!  Apple is always on the mark - this product has a great design and result.
"March 12, 2025","Just buy it. I have an AirTag in my motorcycle, hidden in my wallet, and one in my cranium to assure I don’t forget my brain at home when I go out.Never had a problem with the “Find My” app on my iPhone and AirTag, and it has lasted me a year and a half, still going strong.It’s quite thin and can fit pretty much anywhere. The location accuracy isn’t bad, and as long as you’re within close proximity, you can make it beep and follow the sound to find it.Get one, it’s worth the price!"
"March 11, 2025","After seeing a heartbreaking Facebook post about a lost dog in my area that looked exactly like mine, I had a wake-up call. Even though my dogs are microchipped, I realized that wouldn’t help me find them in real-time if they ever got loose. That’s when I decided to get AirTags for their collars, and I’m so glad I did.Setup was incredibly easy—literally just a few taps on my phone, and they were ready to go. The best part? I can share their location with family members, so we all have access in case of an emergency. It gives me so much peace of mind knowing that if my dogs ever wander off, I can track them down quickly instead of relying on lost posters and hoping for the best.If you have a pet, I highly recommend getting an AirTag. It’s a small investment for a huge sense of security."
"March 10, 2025","I had thought this was like a GPS and wasn’t for sure how it would work on my pet’s collar. We found out how it worked when our dog disappeared. We kept seeing that it was at a location about 20 miles away and didn’t feel like he would go that far. We went to the locations it was pinging at but dog was not there. However, someone removed it from his collar and it was in their vehicle. Since they had iPhones we were able to get police involved and go to the final destination and our dog was there and we were able to get dog, collar and air tag returned. We at least now know that if someone finds him with an iPhone it will show location of the air tag."
"March 10, 2025","Unique application, what to share with you and unusual way to use the AirTag and that is to take a spare with you when you travel and have a rental car and attach it to the rental car keys that way when you misplaced the rental car keys, you have a prayer finding them if you lose rental car keys you can expect to pay hundreds of dollars For replacement"
"March 9, 2025",I think I may have accidentally written a poor review on this item and that was meant for another product. This was great and everything was as expected. Thanks and sorry if I did accidentally leave a bad review not meant for you! :)
"March 8, 2025",Bought a cheaper offbrand at first did not fit the air tag holder for the original AirTag I was not impressed as it had me jumping through loops. I returned the cheap one and bought the AirTag. I'm very impressed and happy because my dog wears it on his collar and I have not lost him yet. A definite go.!
"March 7, 2025","I've been a loyal fan of Apple devices for decades, but it's important to understand that the AirTag is NOT a GPS tracker, and therefore may not be the best option for keeping on your pets to find in the event they become lost.  While it's conveniently set up on the Find My network, it works ONLY with Apple devices, and the Find My network range is limited because it relies on other Apple devices in the area to relay the AirTag's location.  So if you're in a rural or remote area with no other or limited Apple devices around, the AirTag will be difficult to locate, if at all."
"March 7, 2025","Good quality as I would expect from Apple. I chose to purchase from Amazon because the price was slightly lower. And on Apple I could only get either one or four, and here I could get two which is exactly what I needed."
"March 7, 2025","Airtags are great.  They came in very handy for giving me peace of mind during some long-distance travel.  I had my car shipped for part of the trip and I could watch on an iPhone map where in the country my car was at any minute.  Also, if you have one in your wallet or purse or key ring and you can’t find those in your house, just click on the phone app and it will show you how to walk to the right place within a certain distance (30’ I think) to find your missing keys, etc.  I’d rate it a “5” except in the four-pack of Air Tags I bought only 3 worked even after replacing the battery."
"March 7, 2025",Helps me keep track of my flight risk dogs. Worth the piece of mind. I tried one of the dog tracking devices; it was useless as it never could get cellular service despite paying for a subscription. This works perfectly. I was worried about my dogs accidentally ingesting one; but I found a great holder for the tags to put on a collar. I also used them for our luggage on our European trip. It’s nice to get alerts about items no longer being with you. Highly recommend
"March 5, 2025","I stashed one in a PODS container when we moved from LA to Orlando. I knew where it was at all times. I have one on my TV remote, each suitcase and carryon, and in my car. I even have one in my hat and it led me right to it when I left it in a restaurant."
"March 5, 2025","It’s Apple!! I use the “find me” for my keys, my husbands keys, and our dogs collar.(Just incase she got out unexpected). I had one of the air tags due after 4 years, so easy to replace in Amazon."
"March 5, 2025","Good product connectivity was a breeze. Accuracy is slightly off, but close enough sound quality is good for what it is. Thickness of the AirTags is good at least for my application. It’s about the size of a quarter roughly and seems durable right off the package, but I always like to add a extra layer of coverage with a AirTag sleeve"
"March 4, 2025","These AirTags are AWSOME. I used to lose /misplace my wallet and other things.  Not anymore. as This little  device embedded in my wallet now pinpoints it and saves search times.When traveling what a comfort for tracking my airline baggage, back pack or other such items .. I even have one embedded in my dogs collar ."
"March 3, 2025","Extremely helpful when the airport can’t find your luggage.  You can tell the airline where your luggage is, lol.  They were easy to connect to my phone.  The size is great for my luggage and backpack.  I put a case on mine to help with durability."
"March 3, 2025","WORKS PERFECTLY FINE, it works really fantastic I can track it for really long time it tells you the right spot , and works in find mine too this product is legit should get and you get it form a discount too from here, the sound quality is normal I can hear and find it to and has a great connection"
"March 3, 2025","Bought this bcuz I lost my purse and I never want to experience that again, I was iffy about getting it but I did. Even bought a waterproof keyring thing to click on to my purse.It does exactly what a airtag does, I definitely recommend it I am about to order a second one."
"March 2, 2025",I got this to put on my beagle but I’m a bit disappointed that the range isn’t very far.  I had rethought it would work just like anyone on find friends but it doesn’t.  I think the range was around one mile or there about.  It works very well on the holder that attaches it to my beagles collar. It’s not in her way at all.
"March 1, 2025",Got it for my daughter because she would always i mean always lose her cars and it would cost alot to replace it!! Finally got her one and it's been great
"March 1, 2025",I purchased the air tag to keep up with my Husky.  We live on a farm with acres to roam on.  I can be sure to know that he is within the range of an invisible fence with an air tag on his collar.
"March 1, 2025","Somehow the air tag knows when I am actually on a road trip with my luggage as it alerts me as to when I have moved out of range. When my luggage is at home and I go away, the device knows to not alert me."
"February 28, 2025","There was a stray cat in our neighborhood and i was curious what he does during the day so i put an apple air tag on him, one day I'm at my desk and i see it shows he's not in Miami is on the move in the highway going north almost passing Plantation, I tell my manager I got to go and check on him and so it takes me to a Walgreens and was pinging inside of hood of a Stanger's car, I go into the Walgreens and ask who's car is this and it was a cashier's car and so he was just as shocked and he opened the hood of his car and there he was filled with oil and dirt and ALIVE to our surprise, so we took him back home and cleaned him up and after that day he never left our home! He choose us to be his furever home after that day."
"February 28, 2025","Great product. I’m a very active person who hikes in the woods and is outside with my dogs frequently. On a couple of occasions my car keys have fallen out of my pocket, prompting an arduous search to locate them in an open field. After the second time that this occurred, I purchased this product. It works extremely well as advertised. Highly recommend if you find yourself losing or misplacing your keys or other personal items."
"February 28, 2025",excellent Apple product.  Works exactly as advertised.  No need to have GPS because this does the job as long as you have apple infrastructure.
"February 27, 2025","I recently got the Apple AirTag for my pup, and it’s been a total game changer! It’s super easy to attach to her collar, and the setup was quick and straightforward through the Find My app. Now, I can always track her location with just a few taps on my phone—whether she’s in the backyard or on a walk. The precision is surprisingly spot-on, and I love how it gives me peace of mind knowing I can locate her if she ever gets out of sight. The battery life is great, and the AirTag is small and lightweight, so it doesn’t bother her at all. If you’re looking for a reliable way to keep tabs on your furry friend, I highly recommend this! It’s a must-have for pet owners."
"February 27, 2025",I love them  I have it on my keys so I don’t lose them & if I do it tells me where they are
"February 26, 2025","I’m always running late or misplacing my keys, as an Apple owner this purchase was a no brainer! The set up was a breeze and only took 2 minutes from opening the box to pinging my device for the first time. I would highly recommend getting an AirTag for your valuables."
"February 25, 2025",My wife lost her keys in a snowbank.  We likely wouldn't have found them until all the snow melted without the air tag.
"February 24, 2025",I bought this for my kitty that I let outside for a bit and it’s good to know I can find her if needed.
"February 24, 2025","Perfect for keeping track of your valuable items, such as a wallet or suitcase. Easy to connect to phone and track. Very durable and long range!"
"February 23, 2025",Item arrived on time.  I purchased this for a white Elephant Christmas gift and it was a BIG hit!  I might just get one for myself 0). Thank you.
"February 22, 2025","If we had half stars id give it a 3.5. Its good - I use it for my cat. He tends to escape when we arent looking. The main issue is it will say it cant locate it sometimes. Cat was hiding in a cabinet in the living room and standing right next to it, it was having a hard time locating it. Other times it work well but I wish the range was bigger. Love the sound feature; thats been the most helpful part"
"February 22, 2025",I love these I been a apple user for years and they are GREAT for when I losses my keys or a bag
"February 21, 2025",I got this for my key ring as I’m always losing my keys. The location is accurate which makes the keys easy to find.
"February 21, 2025",The Apple AirTag is a great product at an affordable price. It’s incredibly easy to use and works seamlessly for tracking your belongings. It also makes an excellent white elephant Christmas gift
"February 20, 2025","new in box, works easy, and does what its supposed to.Will buy againNever going to lose my keys ever again!"
"February 18, 2025",We bought this for our grandson as a gift for Christmas.  He was thrilled with it.  He travels quite a bit and wanted it for his luggage.  He's very happy with it.
"February 17, 2025","I think they are great. I put one in each of my granddaughters backpack. The one thing that I was disappointed in is it tells you starting point but it does not let you know where they are in between. And then when they arrive, I’ll let you know where they are."
"February 16, 2025",Already came in handy! Got it for the pup and he ran out today and we found him in no time at all!!
"February 16, 2025","Got one for my keys and one for my wallet, very handy for the times your on q rush and can't remember where you left your keys around the house, I'm happy with the purchase"
"February 15, 2025","We use these for various reason, I have one on my key ring.  However, when I cannot find them, it is really difficult to hear the find me sound.  I wish it was much louder.  Even one room over it is almost impossible to hear. Other than that they are great."
"February 15, 2025",Out dog kept sneaking out so now we can see where she is. We searched the neighborhood and hung signs and she was in the Pool!! Now we’ll always know the area she is in!
"February 15, 2025",Excellent for car keys!!! That’s my primary use for these since everyone in the house drives out cars interchangeably and the keys don’t always find their way back to their place of origin. These are fantastic.
"February 14, 2025","I can’t have enough of these. Iykyk  cats collars, wallet, backpacks, keys.. put them on all of the things that disappear 🤣🤣"
"February 14, 2025","I can't tell you how many times I have used this to find my keys or my wallet. I have about 8 of them and keep them on every key chain for every car and every wallet/purse, etc. Everyone needs these.I have not yet tried them to track luggage when flying but I know people who do."
"February 13, 2025",At first I was questioning even writing a review for this product but after a recent mishap I can not recommend these more. I have one on my keys and put one in my checked bags for flights. Recently my bags were misplaced when I was flying back from Canada and the only reason they were able to get the bag back to me is because of my Airtag. They were able to call me from it and I was able to tell them my address and go tmy bags back. Can not recommend these more as they have already paid for themselves and saved me hundreds of dollars.
"February 13, 2025",Loved these! I had never purchased before because I never taught I’d be necessary for my trip. This time my husband and I were flying to Brazil for the first time and so we had a couple extra gifts and the bags and taught I’d be a good idea to get. I probably won’t be flying without them again. Super easy to use and follow.
"February 13, 2025","Just what I needed, my dog is a little escape artist.  Now I know where he is at all times."
"February 12, 2025",This is a great way to have your belongings safe and know where it is at all times. It even makes an alarm noise to know where it is or alert someone that the belonging is lost. You can you the find my phone app to access this and is a great way to feel secure while on the go. Totally recommend it!
"February 12, 2025",I have a collar this slips into so my 21 lbs cat can be found I I lose him. Peace of mind.
"February 11, 2025","This tag will fit inside a holder to attach to your pet’s collar.  You need to buy the holder separately.  Using the iPhone’s Find My app, you can track the whereabouts of your pet in case it escapes.  There are no monthly charges to make the tag function."
"February 11, 2025","Lost keys driving you crazy? There's a better way! This tracker is your answer. Attach it, track it, find it. Problem solved"
"February 11, 2025","I have an AirTag on everything that I need to make sure that I don’t misplace… checked baggage, carry-on, wallet, keys, etc. Very easy to use, very quick to pair to your account, it has a really good range and if you’re just using this product as normal the battery life on it is pretty good."
"February 10, 2025","I had never used AirTags before, nor completely understood the application of AirTags to prevent theft, find your devices, or get an alert to your phone when leaving an item behind - such as your tagged wallet or keys.I tagged my keys and my wallet.  If I walk out the door without either item, I get an alert to my phone indicating I've left the item behind.  The AirTag can then by tracked by my phone and will direct me to the precise location of the item, such as my keys or wallet.Before AirTags? I used to search for items that fell behind the couch or that I dropped getting out of the car or credit cards (tagged wallet) that I left in the restaurant.  If my wallet were stolen, I would get a ""separation"" alert showing the location of the stolen wallet.  Of course, I would then immediately disable my credit cards.These provide a great piece of mind in my daily hectic life.  After I bought the first one, and learned how they worked, I bought two more (with cases) for my luggage.  You can also put a tag on your dog's collar or in your child's backpack.  The uses are endless.The price dropped from 29 dollars, or so, to 19.00 and you can get a similar discount for a 4 pack.  You won't regret it!"
"February 9, 2025","Inexpensive, syncs seamlessly and quickly with other Apple products, batteries are replaceable. I have one on my dog’s collar, one in my car, one on my key ring, and one in my purse.  The Apple brand accessories (e.g., fobs) are silly expensive though, best to buy one of the many knock offs available on Amazon and elsewhere.  Watch out for knock off AirTags on Amazon, some of them look pretty convincing."
"February 8, 2025",Nice to have a little bit of security when you attach it something you can walk away from for a while.
"February 8, 2025",Is this Apple tag to put on my cats collar works great so I will stick with this product
"February 7, 2025",AirTags help me keep up with my keys and wallet. they aren't perfect but they surely work well. Fast delivery!!
"February 7, 2025",We recently went on vacation and put an airtag in our luggage.  Upon arriving at our destination our luggage wasn't at baggage claim.  I could easily track it on our phone and showed he airline employee and they were able to locate our bag for us.  Very easy to set up on your iphone.  The functionality of it is great easy to use.  Great as a gift for someone who travels a lot too.  Accuracy is amazing!  Even can make a sound if you lost an item near you like a wallet or keys.
"February 6, 2025",I am amazed by the battery life of this air tag. It’s a perfect way to get keep track of your kiddos when they leave for school. I guess I’m a helicopter mom. I clipped on of these bad boys onto my sons backpack. So I can keep tabs on his location lol.
"February 6, 2025","I love how seamlessly the AirTag connects to the iPhone. I put one on my keys, and it makes finding them so easy. When I first bought one as a gift, we even turned it into a fun game—one person would hide it, and the other would use the tracking to find it, like a mini scavenger hunt! Just add the AirTag to the Find My app, and it literally guides you to it, even showing how many feet away you are. Plus, you can play a sound when you’re close to help locate it faster. Such a lifesaver!"
"February 5, 2025","Dog got out (again) and when I tried to find her, the dang phone needed updating and it took well over 10 mins to get everything operational again. So, be sure your phone is UTD to expect to be able to use it quickly."
"February 4, 2025","I wish Apple tags were cheaper I love having them on my keys, my kid, the pets, in our suitcases"
"February 1, 2025",I was a little suspicious buying something like this off of Amazon but the other reviews were promising. It ended up being just fine. I used it to put into my checked luggage and it added an extra sense of security knowing that I could keep an eye on my personal belongings while traveling. Some times it would take a little longer to update but I did not experience any long term issues. Good gift to get someone too! I will be getting more. Arrived in good condition.
"February 1, 2025",Keeps all my favorite things from getting lost (especially my pets)! I put this one in my new puppy’s collar.
"February 1, 2025",I love my Apple Air Tag…I have mine on my keys… so I can always know where my keys are..I just bought my husband one too and he loves his too. And we also know where each others keys are at…
"January 31, 2025",I originally purchased AirTags to place in all of my family’s luggage. Airlines are always misplacing luggage and using an AirTag helps with locating them. I recently purchased a dog collar that has a place for an AirTag. My puppy has gotten loose and we added an airTag to the collar. You will be alerted when the battery needs to be changed (after about a year). Easy to purchase batteries on Amazon. Easy to install.  Everyone needs airtags.
"January 30, 2025","It's an Apple Airtag, what can I say?  Easy to setup, will do what I need it to."
"January 28, 2025","We have this on our kitten and it works great. We  use the function to find and when it beeps my cat knows to come into the house,"
"January 27, 2025","I bought this AirTag in August '24. It works well to track my car and I paired with Find My on my iPhone as per the instructions. The tracking is not super precise in motion; if you are tracking your item as it moves it can take a few minutes to sync. I've used it before to find my car in a big university parking lot, for example, so I don't have to worry about finding where I parked after a long day of classes. Also it gives me some peace of mind living in an apt complex with no gates where people have stolen cars before."
"January 27, 2025",Always great to have another one. We used this one when we went to Disney World recently and put it on her stroller since we had to leave it outside a lot of the rides just for a piece of mind.
"January 26, 2025","Super easy to use and I put it on my pet in case anything happens. Luckily haven’t had to use it much but I’ve checked it a couple of times and works perfect. I also get a notification when I “leave” it, just in case it’s a mistake."
"January 24, 2025",These worked great as expected although the distance they are readable from is not very good around 50 m. It lost connection.
"January 23, 2025","Been using these since they first came out.  So helpful to locate items and gives me peace of mind. They really pretty darn accurate, connect easily, battery lasts a long time and is easy to change. Durable for everyday life. Easy to hear their beep/chirp during location search.  I trust and depend on these tags."
"January 22, 2025","He was losing his wallet often, now with the tag always give him an alert in his cellphone"
"January 21, 2025",I constantly am dropping my purse different places around the house and spend more time looking for it so this has been a great help in locating it quickly as I’m headed out the door. Would highly recommend to help people
"January 18, 2025",Bought these for our ebikes. They were easy to set up and use and they seem to work pretty well. We are still getting the hang of using them. They often remind us that we have left an item behind when we really haven't (we are still there.) I think it is more an issue of user fluency than a problem with the device.
"January 18, 2025",First one was not delivered in box as it should have been.Amazon replaced without problem.Works great.
"January 16, 2025","These very first time I used it. My luggage was lost. The agent told me my suitcase was in Madrid. I showed her on my phone where it was in Dallas. A short six days later, I was reunited with my suitcase."
"January 10, 2025","Wish i could connect to multiple phones at the same time! But, works great for a set of keys."
"January 10, 2025","I purchased this after a frantic day of searching for my Kindle. It easily linked to my iPhone’s Find My app. Now, I can see the location of and play a tone to help me locate my precious Kindle."
"December 18, 2024","I had considered purchasing these for a long time to track things such as my backpack and luggage but only days after I purchased the first one I found myself buying more. They work amazingly well!  I had worried for a long time about my elderly father out driving around and something happening. Let me say, I did not do this behind his back, I explained to him what it was and that id like to put one in his vehicle so I could find him if something happened. I honestly think it made him more comfortable about his traveling as well. They are great to track almost anything!"
"November 30, 2024","Apple AirTag. Keep track of and find your key: words with my apple phone ap. Convenient, easy, low profile."
"November 17, 2024",Does what its made to do. Connects quickly and easy to change the battery. Would buy again.
