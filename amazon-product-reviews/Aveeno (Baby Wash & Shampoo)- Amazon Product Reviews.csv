"March 13, 2025","This is honestly the best shampoo and body wash for babies ever!I have tried them all and this is the most consistent in quality, and PERFECT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!It is awesome value for your money. The size of this bottle is huge I’d think it was from Costco.It’s very effective in cleaning the babies scalp and body without harsh chemicals. There is not really a scent to it which is perfect because scents can irritate the skin. There is also no color to it, just clear!There are obviously more cheaper ones out there but this is the best quality and it is the best price on Amazon! We have this on subscription and will never go to any other baby shampoo. If you are thinking of trying it… JUST DO IT!!!"

"December 16, 2024",my son has been using this for 10 years. no problem at all great for kids. even youth.
"December 4, 2024",My go to baby wash with all my babies
"November 17, 2024","It was found Johnson and Johnson put cancer causing ingredients in sunscreens, which they also sell treatment for, so we stopped all J&J products if they don’t care about that.  Aveeno may be okay but we swapped anyway to someone with a conscious"
"November 14, 2024",It’s excellent product for my baby. Have been using since last couple of years.! Only issue I see in packaging. Unable to bring opener up.! Most of time it works but have issue in some.! Thanks
"November 14, 2024","We've been using these for a long time for our young kid. Looking at my order history, looks like I've ordered many many of these bottles. This makes a good lather during showers and cleans and smells good afterwards. No complaints all."
"November 11, 2024","I used CeraVe Baby on my newborn and it was ok, but didn’t lather very well so I felt like I had to use a lot of it for it to do anything. I then used Aquaphor Baby which was way too harsh on her - it left her scalp very red, peeling, and angry. We finally switched to Aveeno and her scalp improved within the first wash. Aveeno lathers very well and has been gentle on her skin. I am sensitive to smells and I think this one smells good!"
"November 6, 2024","I have been using Aveeno Baby Daily for a few years now. I love the slight scent and my kids love it too. The price has gone up a bit, but it is still worth it. Big bottle lasts a long time. It is perfect for my kids sensitive skin. Sometimes, I use it too :)"
"October 30, 2024",Best on market
"October 29, 2024",I like this for sensitive skin but wish it lathered better. I feel like I use more than should be necessary to get the kids clean. .

"October 18, 2024","Head & Shoulders is the worst product to consider putting on your head, so I stopped using it a long time ago. My family suggested I try this one, and it actually helped my hair grow a lot healthier in just a few weeks! It also smells pretty good too. 😚"
"October 14, 2024","I have been using Aveeno since my kiddo was born. Few months ago, I bought mustela one time for my kiddo and he got rashes, itchiness all the time from that product. I switched it back to Aveeno wash and after few washes with this shampoo and soap and aveeno oat bath, his skin is great again! There is no smell, nothing bad in this product. I will use their product always! It doesn't dry skin."
"October 12, 2024","This product smells nice, is well packaged and doesn't seem to hurt my baby's eyes, but I have noticed it exacerbates the eczema on my hands pretty badly. His skin also seems pretty dry afterwards if I don't use a heavy lotion after baths. Clearly other people have had better experiences though, so maybe you'll have better luck."
"October 12, 2024",not tear free
"October 10, 2024","Finally, my skin can feel good with this!"
"October 10, 2024",I am using for my two children from their childhood.. Not scented and good quality
"October 9, 2024",Gentle and soft soap on my toddlers skin. Very light fragrance. Good value size.
"October 4, 2024","I’ve been using Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Gentle Bath Wash & Shampoo for my toddler, and it’s fantastic. The natural oat extract is gentle on sensitive skin, and the hypoallergenic, tear-free formula ensures bath time is pleasant for my baby. The smell is faint, not overbearing. The bottle pump works great. The packaging was excellent—no leaks or spills. Overall, a great product that delivers on its promises and is perfect for delicate skin."
"October 4, 2024",I love this product it’s good for my babies skin
"October 4, 2024","This product is great.  I'm old and I have wimpy skin. I love this product.  My skin often disagrees with products.  But,  this one is 💰. It smells nice and subtle.  It doesn't have a too. Much extra krap in it. And because I use so much the pump is extremely convenient."
"September 27, 2024","This will be the only soap I use on my baby for now on. He has eczema so I pair this with the eczema therapy lotion and it’s the best combo for sensitive out there with super nourishing ingredients. The smell isn’t the best but it’s not awful. Keeps my baby’s skin super soft and it’s just great all around. It’s a great price as well for the amount of product you get, I also love that it comes with a pump for easy access!"
"September 25, 2024","- I get the eczema one for my baby as it is fragrance free. It was sold out and got this.- It is pthalate free but probably artificial fragrance as the bottle doesn't say it's from a natural source.- I found the fragrance overwhelming!!! Might not be so for you but I typically buy fragrance free personal care products and if you are like me, I would advice against buying this."
"September 24, 2024",The price is a great deal for the amount you get. We bought this as a refill for a smaller bottle we have. Love the pump. The product itself is wonderful for our baby. Gentle yet effective on the skin. Lightly scented but concentrated to where a little goes a long way.
"September 23, 2024","Use it on my baby, no irritation, no break outs. Leaves the skin feeling moist and soft. Love it"
"September 22, 2024","I advise you to use it I showed it to my husband, we bought them. My baby's skin is very fresh and they smell  are simple."
"September 9, 2024",my baby favorite
"September 7, 2024","Lovely baby wash, very gentle and keeps my baby’s skin soft. The bottle design could be a bit easier to handle with one hand."
"September 6, 2024",This is the only soap I’ve used on my baby since he was born. It’s gentle on skin and smells amazing. Very high qualIt’s product and ingredients. The pump makes it so much easier to dispense the soap while washing the baby.
"September 6, 2024","I have been buying this baby wash for several years, and have always loved it, but I bought this bottle 2 months ago, and it’s already old. It has started to have a terrible smell, not pleasant like it should be."
"September 5, 2024","Love this soap, been using it for about a year. Best deal is on Amazon vs big box stores. Get it in bulk when it’s on sale. Not too soapy or smelly, pleasant fragrance and baby loves using it"
"September 2, 2024","My kid's dermatologist recommended Aveeno a while back for their dry skin and my kids have been using it ever since. The scent is really nice, soft and non invasive. I know it's for babies but my boys are 10, 7 and 3 years old and they all use it.I also like the combination of shampoo and wash since that's what my kids do with any product anyway. They have short hair and it's easier, I don't know how it would work for longer hair."
"September 2, 2024","I asked ChatGPT for the best hair products, specifically shampoos for children, and it recommended this brand. I read the reviews and decided to try it. It doesn't cause any irritation for my child and cleans the hair well. I like it and will buy more when this one runs out."
"September 1, 2024","Whether for the hair or body, this Aveeno product is gentle on our child but strong enough to clean even after the messiest days! Despite best efforts, babies still get shampoos in their faces and eyes. The tear free formula is a life saver! The scent is mild enough to leave nothing specific behind - perfumes aren’t always appropriate for kids. The pump is perfect for learning hands!"
"August 29, 2024",This is a good shampoo for kids if your kids is delicate. Also it’s not affordable. The shampoo is not thick nor too thin. Smells very nice. It’s a moisturizing and helps for my boys to be clean
"August 27, 2024","I have a 17 year old pitbull. They're known to have sensitive skin and because she is sometimes incontinent I have to bathe her more frequently. So I like the extra big bottle.I have tried a few different baby shampoos in the past, always leaning towards organic.  There is no scent to speak of with this one, but it is very mild and gentle. And I chose it for the oatmeal for her skin. You don't need to use too much to get her covered.She already has a beautiful silky soft coat, but after 2 baths with this I do notice her coat is extra soft and shiny."
"August 23, 2024",I used this on my baby and now toddler. Works great!
"August 21, 2024",My Doctor recommended it for my sensitive eyes. Very happy with the purchase ☺️
"August 20, 2024",Always trusted one for baby.
"August 18, 2024","I'm a big fan of this baby body wash. I've been using it since my kid was born. I wanted to find a soap that was safe and gentle for babies with sensitive skin and I generally trust the Aveeno brand and the ingredients in their products. I feel like it's safer and more natural than other brands. It smells great, too. It forms a nice lather and leaves her skin feeling fresh and smooth. I buy the bigger 33oz bottle and it usually lasts quite awhile. I would definitely recommend this soap for anyone."
"August 14, 2024",Recommend to use for children and adults.
"August 14, 2024",We’ve been using this Aveeno Baby Wash for two years now. We like it because it has a soft smell and can be used as both a shampoo and as a body wash. We actually switched to this brand when our son started showing some skin sensitivity and it really helped. He doesn’t have any more skin sensitivity but we will continue to use it anyway. We recommend!
"August 13, 2024",Very gentle on my baby’s skin. Great product
"August 12, 2024",We loooove Aveeno our children have sensitive skin and it's the best. We appreciate how you all provide the big bottle at a cheap price compared to others. Thank you. We only purchase from Amazon
"August 9, 2024",This shampoo is absolutely wonderful! I have been buying it since my kiddo was a baby and have been using it for two years now. It's great on sensitive skin and doesn't leave any rashes or any kind or reaction on the skin. I will definitely be getting more from this company!
"August 4, 2024","I love this Baby Wash! The best of the best, I’ve tried probably almost all organic baby products out there and this is by far the best baby wash out there..The size is a big plus, it is very soapy one squirt goes a long way, the scent is Amazing and it is very gentle on my baby’s skin. This a an amazing product. Highly recommended, I am not looking back now."
"July 31, 2024","This is great for cleansing sensitive skin, and especially for washing the face and scrubbing eyelids.  This is in use every day, so the big bottle is very appreciated!"
"July 30, 2024",It's very moisturizing for baby skin and it's anti burn so safe for baby eyes. However it's required a large quantity for a proper baby.
"July 30, 2024","Yes, I have a confession to make. I'm ""the baby"".  Years ago, I quit using ""bar soap"" and began trying different body washes. I wanted something that would not dry out my skin especially during wintertime. Many did well with the cleaning, moisturizing, and lathering up part, but I disliked the strong deodorizing scents they used.  When trying different baby washes, the scents were gentle and my skin did not dry out, but I found they did not lather-up well. However, Aveeno has a nice rich lather that spreads easily, it does not dry out my skin, and it is lightly scented.  I just started using it a few weeks ago and waited to write my review. I wanted to make sure I liked it before recommending it for your baby ... or for yourself. (Shh! I won't tell)."
"July 28, 2024",This is great for kids and I always buy from Amazon .Amazon always have better price then the other store
"July 18, 2024",this is perfect for my sensitive baby
"July 6, 2024",Nice size with pump. Perfect. Not too sudsy unless really work up the water
"June 21, 2024",Better that any others I tried
"June 13, 2024",He like this.
"June 12, 2024",Specialist said I should use baby shampoo from now on. This works well and cleans my hair.
"June 10, 2024","I love this shampoo/baby wash. Smells good, doesn’t bother my baby’s skin and is a great price."
"June 2, 2024",We love this shampoo for our two babies. Last us forever.
"May 30, 2024","I have sensitive skin and the body washes that I regularly used started giving me problems.  I decided to give this a try and I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a great clean smell, it lathers wonderfully and moisturizes great.  I continue to purchase this product."
"May 24, 2024","Softness,smell so good,value for money 💯"
"May 19, 2024",Like this product
"May 15, 2024",Love the brand. This is the only brand I can use on my babies skin without him breaking out. I with I could afford the whole line every month for him but I do use the body wash/shampoo every morning and every night for my son.
"May 2, 2024","Aveeno is a good product for adults , so it must be good for a baby’s delicate skin. This was requested by the mom-to-be. The experience with the seller was good.  The product was as pictured.  The way the seller  packaged the lotion was done with care, so that there was no chance of it leaking."
"April 29, 2024","This product is absolutely fantastic!! Nonetheless, the bottle in this size is quite weighty. If you're using this larger bottle size, I recommend placing it inside the tub or on the floor outside the tub to prevent accidents like this.I've discovered that the Aveeno wash/shampoo is incredibly gentle on my child's sensitive skin. It doesn't possess an overpowering scent, and you only need a small amount each time. His hair is left wonderfully smooth, and he doesn't experience any skin reactions or eczema along the hairline. I've tried other products such as Simple for Baby and Johnson's No More Tears, but I noticed that these options contain numerous additives that ended up drying out his scalp."
"March 15, 2024",I like this for my newborn
"December 31, 2023","I used this since my girl was a baby. It sure is so soft and good on her skin, leave it very nice and soft. It is perfect for young kids forsure."
"November 5, 2023",I prefer to use this over the Johnson baby one.This is a mild body soap which can also function as a shampoo.Leaves the baby smelling fresh with no tears.Much loved!
"August 10, 2023",Child has sensitive skin and this never causes irritation.
"April 1, 2023",Good price for size
"November 18, 2022",Great lotion for kids
