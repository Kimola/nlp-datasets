" Good Example of Form Over Function I think this is possibly the worst designed product Apple has ever made, in my opinion. I see it as putting form well above function. It was like Apple decided to combine a mouse with a trackpad. In this case, the tracking is done by moving the trackpad around as opposed to using the pad to track. If I remember correctly, someone else on here referred to this mouse as an ergonomic disaster and I have to agree. The sides of this mouse are sharp and pinching with barely anything to grab on to. It appears the mouse was not designed with a consideration for where to put thumbs and any other fingers people might need to use to hold on to a mouse, or at least a spot where they can rest those fingers so they're not in the way . What's more, if my thumb drops as it is inclined to do due to gravity and because it is in pursuit of a stronger grip then my thumb gets pinched between the silver base and the white top part of the mouse that functions like a giant mouse button . It's like my thumb is in the way of this mouse doing what it wants to do. On the opposite side, my little finger gets dragged and pushed around on the mousepad as it has no place to go. To make matters worse, the white touch surface top does not feel secure. It rocks sideways ever so slightly. That loose top gets tiring after a while and I think it may be in part responsible for my struggles getting the mouse to start selecting text on the letter that I want it to start selecting on. The flat white surface of the mouse, the mini trackpad that doesn't track, is good for quick scrolling but there's a catch, I find it gets tiring after a while because my pointer finger is repeatedly hitting and gliding over a hard surface. Sometimes my fingernail scrapes along the surface as well. It was after my fingernail got caught scraping the top of the mouse while scrolling one day that led me to say to myself enough, I'm not using this anymore. In addition to the scrolling getting tired after a while, my index finger does drift over to the middle of the mouse. Having used ergonomic mice, I now believe that the flat shape is partly responsible because there is so little for my hand to grip on to. The drifting leads left clicks to turn into right clicks. It is annoying when I occasionally click on something expecting to select it or what not, only to see the context menu pop up instead. I also got this mouse for my mother to use and her finger drifts over to the right so often that I decided to turn off the right click function to help her out. She doesn't use the right click button so she isn't missing anything but others might have use for the right click button. Despite that, the scrolling feature gets in her way still and she uses that. Another issue both of us have with scrolling, and this is one of the most annoying things about this mouse, is that we often, her more than me I think, find ourselves scrolling sideways while scrolling down or up when we just want to scroll down or up. I've never had that issue on mice with scroll wheels, or any other mouse for that matter. There'd be times when I'd have what I'm looking at lined up just right and then when I scroll, I can't scroll down or up in a straight line with out it moving sideways at some point. Another annoying thing about the touch surface of the mouse is that occasionally I'll brush it with my finger when I'm in the process of putting my hand back on to the mouse after typing on the keyboard. That leads to something happening that I didn't want which needs to then be corrected. One of the bonuses of the touch surface is that it opens the door for tapping and swiping, adding functionality without the need for buttons. I never got comfortable with swiping on a mouse, while I just used tapping in order to use Mission Control. The way it is set up requires a double two-finger tap on the touch surface but what feels like half the time, I don't tap the top of the mouse right and I have to do it again until I get Mission Control to work . That issue didn't go away over time with practice. Tapping, for me, is not a replacement for a third button on a traditional mouse. Another negative, and this one is talked about a lot, is that the lightning port used for recharging is on the underside of the mouse which means in order to recharge the mouse it has to be on its side or laying down with its belly up. That of course means you can't recharge the mouse and use it at the same time. To make matters worse, there aren't many positives I find with this mouse. It is Apple's mouse, for one, and for that you are assured lasting compatibility with Macs. I've had multiple experiences where Logitech mice all of a sudden don't work properly or are not compatible after an update or with a new Mac. Two, the battery lasts a good amount of time. Maybe up to three months on a single charge. That seems good to me. However, I did encounter an issue when I recharged the mouse the first time. Despite following the directions on how to check when the mouse is fully charged, when I went to use it again the following morning I noticed that the charge was at 74%. It was at 12% before I recharged it the night before and said it was at 100% when I unplugged it. I had to recharge it a second time in order to get it up to 100%. Hopefully, that was just a one time issue. The third positive is that the mouse is lightweight. I prefer lightweight mice but in this case, it doesn't make up for the drawbacks. The fourth positive is that its shape and weight makes it easy to fit in a bag or in a pocket. In the end, the positives do not come close to outweighing its negatives for me. The key phrase is, ""for me,"" as there are people out there that prefer tapping and swiping and smaller mice. From my experience, seeing my mother's struggles and reading other reviews, this mouse is simply not for everyone and I don't fully understand why Apple designed it the way they did. Too much form over function to me. I would take a corded mouse over this one if I had to. Unless you prefer mice like the Apple Magic Mouse as opposed to a traditional style mouse with scroll wheels and a mouse like shape, I'd recommend trying out other mice first before paying for this one. Chances are you'll find something that's more comfortable and less frustrating to use for less money. But if you are willing to spend a bit more. Then there are mice out there like the Logitech MX Master which are designed to be more comfortable, may even feel like they are better made than the Magic Mouse, while having more features and capabilities.",-,2023-01-01
" Great work mouse Honestly, this is a fantastic mouse. The touch commands are seamless if you're used to the mac platform. Great with multiple monitors, makes my job a lot easier when going back and forth between desktops and windows.

" must for Apple users... But I wish some things were different... I've had this mouse for about a year now - and I actually purchased another one to use with my MacBook (still in the packaging, because.. well- I never really need a mouse when I'm just on my laptop.). I use this mouse with my daily iMac and it's awesome for the touchiness of it, I love the feel and being Bluetooth is AWESOME, because I don't love cords all over my best.My big negative for this is since Apple has changed their cords, when I go to charge it, I can only do so off of my laptop, and then I have to reconnect it from the Bluetooth features with a raggidy old plug-in mouse that works with my older model iMac to get to the settings (That's still alive and kicking and my daily driver after a solid 10ish years! Long live Apple!). I do love how long it stays charged. I probably charge it less than twice a month and I spend quite a bit of my time at my computer for my work. Highly recommend if you want to keep your desk neat and tidy with minimal cords and a sleek look.",-,2023-01-02

"Responsive, light, and smooth Short of it, this is an excellent product. Long description… I was reluctant to pay the higher price for the services of a mouse but I did. The mouse is very responsive to light touches and super smooth when using the scroll. I changed to a Mac for work after many years using PC only. I thought I would regret losing the wide array of options for a mouse. Six months later, I have to say, there may be some plus and minus features moving between Mac and PC. The Magic Mouse is a huge plus for the Mac experience. The shape is sleek for sliding into my backpack and slides with easy when in use. There is no stutter delay when scrolling like you might experience with a PC mouse. Whenever I use a PC now, I wish there was an equivalent quality mouse that would work this good without any fuss. I use an Arc Mouse on my PCs so you would think the performance would be on the same level but sadly, it is not. It looks like an inconvenient hack to make this work on my PCs also but who knows, it might be worth the trouble.",-,2023-01-03

"Not Apple's best product, but gets the job done If you have used one of these mice before then you don't really need a review. I'll just say it looks nice in black although it starts looking dirty slightly easier than the white one. If you haven't used this product before, these are some important considerations: a. It's the most Mac-compatible mouse that I know of, it being from the same company. So you'll have access to all the nice gestures and features. That is a huge plus if you're a fan of the MacOS interface. b. Its biggest flaw by far is the charging situation. The charging port is BELOW the mouse, making it physically impossible to charge the mouse WHILE using it. Battery lasts for a long time though, so it might be very rare that you cannot use it because it's charging--just remember to do so while you're away and you'll be good to go.c. As I mentioned, battery life is really good. You can also leave it sleeping without turning it off and nothing bad will happen. I think I charge mine every couple of months, with 3-5 days a week of usage. d. If you want this for gaming, DO NOT BUY, as you have no buttons, scroll wheel, and the sensor is fully tuned for everyday browsing and editing and not for precise movements, and its movement is very assisted (although I'm not sure to what extent that's on MacOS's side). About looks, it definitely looks nice both in white and black. Its wireless so it looks nice and elegant.f. On build quality, some units are not on par with the best of Apple's products, but it is still very solid. It definitely doesn't feel cheap although it's definitely pricey for what it does, considering that it hasn't been upgraded in many years.TL;DR: 4/5 stars. Negative: charging port, price. Positive: MacOS gestures, long battery life, looks a feels good.",-,2023-01-03
"Great... With a design flaw Love the functionality of the mouse. However, placing the charger poses a bit of an issue. Some users of this device including myself occasionally use it until the last potential second however when wanting to charge it, you're forced to flip it and then charge it as the charging port is on the bottom of the mouse which then means you'll have to wait till it's charged to amount of your liking until you can then continue to use it. I'd prefer that they redesign the product to allow charging while using it.",-,2023-01-03

"Nice touch I had been without a Magic Mouse on my Mac for quite some time (I want to say maybe 10 years?) as the one that originally came with my iMac died after the alkaline batteries had leaked. To be perfectly honest, lol, I just bought a wireless aluminum Mac keyboard and decided I need things to match! I know… Outside of that I, really do like the new version of the Magic Mouse. As Apple goes, the mouse has a great sleek design and I greatly appreciate the technology behind the capacitive tap for clicking and gestures. My only minor complaint is that I find a bit of a narrowed grip because of how angular the sides of the mouse are. I find that when I squeeze the sides of the mouse, the grip and movement are a bit uncomfortable when I have to give the the Magic Mouse a really good squeeze when I lift it off the mouse pad while using it. Resultantly I purchased, here on Amazon, these black bumpers that affix to either side of the Magic Mouse which creates a flatter, vertical surface on each side, which makes for a less straining grip. I love the long lasting internal battery and for any complaints you read about, recharging from the underside of the Magic Mouse is a minor inconvenience; it's no big deal. If the battery gets low and I need a mouse for the next hour I just plug in a wired one and keep going until the Magic Mouse completely re-charges. So I give this mouse a 4, only because of the slight narrowness that I found for my use but overall really like it.",-,2023-01-04

He said it was very simple to set up and he's extremely happy to have it! I'm glad he enjoys his gift, definitely a good buy for an elderly person if they need help using the laptop. He said the instructions were really easy too. He's kind of tech savvy with apple products anyway.

It's alright but among other choices not the best It's alright works well connects well. Clicking is a little meh scrolling is meh. The whole top is a touch pad. It's more touch pad than mouse.

I'd much rather pop a battery in it once a year like my old mouse. As others have said, the charger input is on the bottom of the mouse so I can't use it while it's being charged.

"Good for work, Bad for Gaming, Overpriced. This mouse is an ergonomic nightmare. The sides are sharp and their is nowhere to rest your thumb. Their is a critical design flaw where you cannot use the mouse while it's charging due to the charging port being on the bottom of the mouse. This mouse is very bad for gaming; First person shooters for example require you aim down sights by holding right click in order to accurately fire but you cannot left click while holding right click and vice versa. This means you can't fire if your aiming; making playing fps gaming impossible. The scroll well is digital but is pretty responsive. This mouse is good for work but ultimately overpriced.

"Not a sensitive mouse Apple has never been known for its mouse's sensitivity, but they seem to be getting worse with each model. I can cope, but it's annoying.

"Not a great mouse I bought this mouse for smooth scrolling, like my Mac trackpad, and basic gestures. Since it's a touch surface, half the time when you try to click, it also scrolls slightly at the same time, making you miss the button you're trying to click on. Since the surface of the mouse is plastic instead of glass, the scrolling experience is only smooth if you have very dry skin, any little bit of oil or moisture and it feels sticky and the gestures are difficult to perform. There is also no way to perform a middle mouse button click, and back/forward gestures only work in specific apps that have support for this gesture. And of course they put the charging port on the bottom so you can't use it while charging. On the plus side, it is easy to pair and has a very good Bluetooth polling rate so it is relatively lag-free, for a bluetooth mouse.",-,2023-01-05

"Tons of gesture control, easy to use, great battery life Got this for my mom since my sibling got her a 2020 M1 Macbook Pro. All of the other mice on amazon that were Mac compatible were either entirely too cheap looking or didn't have the functionality that comes with the Apple ecosystem. This ticks plenty of boxes with minor cons. Nice job ApplePros:-Prompts for connection within seconds of powering on near the PC of choice-Great feel in hand and smooth glide (with a good mousepad, LTTStore is my choice)-Fantastic gesture controls! Just fiddle with the settings menu for a few minutes, I swear it could change the way you look at this mouse. It can have a right-click, it can zoom with a double-tap, and the scrolling feels natural; as if you were touching the screen and dragging the page upward/downward-Hilariously long battery life for something my mom uses 3-4 hours a day. She charges it once a week.-Included USB-C to Lightning cable (3ft/1m)Cons:-Dumb charging port location, IMO-DPI or its polling rate is too low, I can't tell but it feels utterly laggy at the initial movement and speeds up after a couple of inches-Pricing, but it is what it is.

"This is perfect So I just bought the new Magic Keyboard with the track pad for my iPad Pro 11. The track pad on the keyboard works wonderfully well, BUT, I don't always like the use a track pad. Sometimes, a regular mouse on a mouse pad just feels right. I almost got another brand of Bluetooth mouse for my new iPad with keyboard set up but then saw that the Magic Mouse 2, in Space Gray, was available. I went for it. What the heck...all matching stuff...iPad, Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse 2. It's magic. I've set up my iPad on my coffee table with the keyboard attached and like to sit back while lying on the floor with everything right in front of me. The Magic Mouse 2 just feels so good using it on the iPad. It was so simple to set up. Make sure Bluetooth is on on the iPad, then flip the little switch on on the bottom of the Magic Mouse 2...go to settings, Bluetooth....it will pair automatically after you click on the Magic Mouse 2 that shows up on the Bluetooth devices list. It was quick, simple and flawless. I went on the Mouse settings on the iPad to adjust pointer speed, scrolling direction and right or left secondary click. All set. I love this mouse. It's very small and portable too, perfect if you're now using your iPad as a laptop with the new Magic Keyboard. Apple does it again. Love it all. Oh, by the way, the Magic Mouse 2 now has a built in rechargeable battery; another big plus. Buy this.",-,2023-01-05
"Sleek and responsive and rechargeable I've had an Apple Magic Mouse since long ago that required batteries. That one lasted 10 years to get to those precision tasks I needed fine mouse movements. The door for the batteries was always tricky and finally stopped closing well. This rechargeable mouse I purchased with a new Macbook Pro has gone the distance and still only is half used up from the initial charge a month ago. It drops the sync very infrequently. It's a win for me and the black look matches up well with the keyboard, though the fingerprints do show more.",-,2023-01-05
"Fussy about the surface I don't know what is going on with these things. Mostly, I like the mouse. However, I prefer to use it on a cloth mousepad. It works fine for months and then it stops tracking in one direction. Remove the pad and it tracks fine over the bare desk. Same thing started happening with my first gen AA battery version of Magic Mouse. It just refused to work with the mousepad after working fine for years. The unit and its lens are clean, so I don't know if a sensor just gets weak as it ages. One day this Magic Mouse II would not stay connected to bluetooth... connect and disconnect every couple of seconds. I put it to the side to take to Apple under warranty. After several weeks, I tried it again and it was working fine.",-,2023-01-05
"Much Needed Replacement for Old Mouse I had been using an older Magic Mouse that was powered by AA batteries. It worked fine, or so I thought. However, for many months I had a persistent problem with my MacBook Air freezing up and having to be restarted in safe mode. At some point I began to suspect that my mouse was the culprit as the freezing only occurred when I was using it and never when using the trackpad. I replaced it with this rechargeable Magic Mouse several weeks ago. I have not had a single incident since then. Furthermore, having to replace the batteries is now history, and as a bonus the black version is very handsome and, I would say, worth the extra $20.",-,2023-01-05

"POOR DESIGN! charging is ridiculous. The mouse doesn't pair automatically with all Macs. Sometimes one actually must go into their bluetooth settings and make it pair. Heaven forbid your bluetooth isn't magically on when you launch a new computer or connected to wireless! Then you absolutely MUST have a backup mouse that is correctly designed so that it can actually be operational when it is plugged into your computer. As for the Apple Mouse, it CANNOT! THE PORTAL PLUGIN IS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUSE! So no, you cannot use it and have it plugged in at the same time. And if it runs out or low on charge, you are SOL until you charge it up. The charge does not last very long either, only a fraction of my Magic keyboard. Currently I'm using an old school Logitech mouse with a handy little USB wireless plug tucked neatly into it's bottom that I can pop out and stick into my USB port just to write this review. It cost $10 and works great. Nuff said!",-,2023-01-05
"Great mouse ,works with iPad Pro 10.5 running iOS 13.4 So I purchased this mouse once but returned it because the scrolling feature did not work on iPad Pro 10.5 iOS 13.2 BUT now that iOS 13.4 is out, it now scrolls. Mostly the mouse works like any other mouse. It has the ability to use gestures and they appear to work. I have a Microsoft mouse and the Magic Mouse 2 functions better at scrolling. The Magic Mouse 2 also scrolls from side to side, if the app supports it. The Microsoft mouse has a wheel and you need to spin it somewhat fast to get it to function somewhat smoothly. Some people said you cannot get to the home screen using it but you can, it's just kind of odd. You basically take the pointer pull it towards the bottom of the screen and that brings up the application in the bar/menu/etc. Pull it quickly towards the bottom and it will downsize the app you are in and expose the desktop. Perform that function again and it will bring up all the apps you have open. At that point you can click on the app you want or put the cursor over the app and flip your finger towards the top which will in turn close the app.I bought this second Magic Mouse 2 directly from Apple because I wanted space gray and Amazon was out of stock. Will I keep it? I think so. Is it worth $50.00 more than the Microsoft mouse that does most of what this does, probably not.

"Sleek. Stylish. Feature-rich... and a nightmare to use. Apple products are known for their visual appeal and how they feel in the user's hand. The ""magic mouse"" has the electronics, sensors, and build quality to be one of the best mice around. What it doesn't have is a size that fits in an adult hand, or a base as wide as the top to keep it from lifting off the surface. The touch-sensitive area on the top is finicky, apparently deciding from time to time that you didn't really want it to perform the function you selected, you wanted something else. And lifting it off the surface to reposition it will certainly result in the touch-sensitive top deciding to perform some random act you didn't want. Why, Apple? I've heard that the sides of the iPhone took thousands of hours of trial and testing to make sure that when you pick it up, you not only have a solid grip, but it feels pleasing to the touch and natural to grip. A mouse is still an essential part of anything more involved than tablet-level device usage; it allows the user to quickly and accurately manipulate windows, select content, position items, and interact in more complex and precise ways than a touchpad can. So .... why the heck make something that looks so good, has some impressive electronics in it, connects seamlessly like other apple devices, yet an hour of using it has me shoving it aside in frustration and plugging a $20 generic USB mouse into an adapter because of frustration from having page flips not work, the unpleasant feeling of my fingertips getting semi-pinched between the top of the mouse and the base, and the desire to have a scrolling function that works right, the same way, every time .Beautiful product. I bring it with me when I need to look cool at a meeting. But if I actually need to do complicated work, I'll make sure I also chuck a cheap mouse in my bag to actually be productive.",-,2023-01-05

"Nothing ""Magic"" About Apple's Magic Mouse I'm very disappointed in the Apple ""Magic"" Mouse I purchased shortly after buying a new Mac Studio computer. After my hand got used to the sharp corners surrounding the top of the mouse, the mouse is a good size and relatively comfortable to hold. But scrolling with my forefinger on top of the mouse's surface is hit or miss. Frequently the movement of my finger isn't picked up by the mouse, and I have to keep repeating the movement and/or clicking the mouse's top to get the cursor moving, which is very annoying when working on a spreadsheet, email, letter or even scrolling down a web page. Also, when working on a spreadsheet, scrolling straight down is often interrupted with unwanted movements to the left or right down the page, which requires frequent ""re-setting"" of the cursor in the position I want... never had this problem with a simple scrolling wheel on top of a Logitech mouse, for example. Based on my experience using this mouse for the past two days, I find trying to place my cursor exactly where I want it is a bit of a challenge. Strangely -- and very un-Steve Jobs-like -- the lightning charging port is located on the underside of the mouse, making charging while using the mouse impossible. I also found it peculiar that while it was simple to connect my mouse to my Mac Studio was a breeze by initially using the charging cable, when I try setting up Bluetooth in the mouse settings, my computer says it can find the mouse... although I'm clearly connected by Bluetooth. While the mouse's design is elegant and sleek, the mouse's functions are clumsy, uncomfortable and unpredictable... which is unfortunate for a premium-priced $79 mouse. How come the company that invented the mouse can't make a better, more functional mouse?",-,2023-01-05

"Not the quality I was expecting This is just not the quality I was expecting from an Apple product. I have iPhone, Air Pods, Mac Book, and a keyboard - they are all really nice. This mouse is just disappointing. I've been using this mouse for a few months and there is just no getting used to the flaws. There is a lot of unintentional scrolling with this mouse. The scroll area goes pretty far back, so you can end up touching that area with your palm. I can't imagine how that would be useful. Also, the scroll area goes to the very, VERY edge, so even if you are gingerly holding it by the sides, you might be touching the top and make the mouse think you're trying to scroll. You'd think the mouse would be smart enough to filter that out - nope. With a scroll so sensitive, you'd think you'd immediately be able to scroll when you want to. Also no. I find myself running my finger over this thing two or three times before it realizes I wanted to scroll. Then there's the form factor. It's just too flat and small. You can become acclimated to the form factor, but I wouldn't call it comfortable. There is no middle click. Granted, most Apple software isn't designed with a middle click in mind, but, there are plenty of non-Apple applications that you might want to use and there are nice features behind the middle click. I would have also expected zoom on a mouse with the ability to accept two fingers. I don't understand why pinch and stretch aren't supported. The charge port is in a useless place. Even if you aren't intending to use it, seeing the mouse upside down or on its side while it's charging makes it look like it's half-disassembled and dead. There are things that I like about this mouse. I like the ability to scroll side to side as easily as up and down. I like the two-finger swipe back. The bluetooth connectivity is good. Battery life is good. But there are too many down-sides to this mouse. Apple really should have spent more time testing this. There is no magic in this magic mouse.",-,2023-01-05
"Functional but not comfortable This mouse was a bit of a flop in the comfort department. My wife and I found it too low profile to be comfortable while using with a lapdesk, it was tiresome on the hands to use for any period of time and forces your fingers into somewhat unnatural positions to operate it. Ergonomics aside the features and functionality all seemed to work, it paired easily, was responsive.

"Perfect Companion for iPad I purchased an iPad Air with a Brydge Keyboard not too long ago, and felt like it was missing something as I carried out daily functions on it. The Magic Mouse 2 in Space Gray completed it. The incorporation of mouse support on iPadOS is a welcome feature, and its compatibility with the Series 2 Accessories is a nice touch. There are multiple features the Magic Mouse boasts, especially on a desktop and or laptop. I mainly appreciate the feature to swipe through my Home screen with ease on the mouse, as well as scroll through pages when I web browse. If you're looking to upgrade to a quality Apple mouse for use with your iPad and or iMac/MacBook , I say go for it. Otherwise there are cheaper alternatives. I mainly chose the Magic Mouse 2 due to the extra features it boasts on iPadOS, and that it's slimmer than most mice and could easily slip into a pouch and/or bag when traveling. On a side note there is also the Magic Trackpad 2 which is compatible with iPadOS and features similar touch features. I however always preferred using a mouse. If the features interest you but do not like using mice I would suggest looking into the Magic Trackpad 2. Overall its another quality product from Apple.

I ended up buying some adhesive attachments to put on the sides to make it big enough so that I wasn't making a claw out of my hand all day. Clicking is loud compared to other mice. The touch gestures are only partially programmable. I never have need to use the side to side swipe gesture, but you can't turn it off, so many times a day I'm inadvertently moving my screen to the side and then having to move it back. If you are used to right clicking, it's not really accurate in detecting that either, leading to a lot of mistaken left clicks, opening menus you didn't want etc. But the absolute worst part of this thing is the charging port which is on the BOTTOM of the mouse. Meaning, if you run out of charge, you have to stop working and what, use your trackpad or find a different mouse? It's the dumbest engineering decision ever.

"Stylish, functional, expensive Carpal Tunnel device It's beautiful, works out of the box (just like you'd expect Apple products to work) and brings a lot of handy features. You can read all about that from the other 5-star reviews, internet so I won't repeat any of that here. This review is solely about what doesn't work - ergonomics. The design is not palm friendly and a few mins of usage will bring you pain as no other mouse has. To fix this, you need to make some additional investments - in the form of widening grips ASIN:B01MT7EN0F and a foam pad (google for Magic Mouse Fixed) that adds the palm-friendly contour to the mouse (see attached screenshot). I just got my foam but found it wasn't enough - you need the widening grips too.Another feature that is highly annoying is that the back of the mouse also acts as a touchpad, so every time you try to click a link and your Finger touches the surface, the web page will scroll a little. This little jump will make you miss the link as you need to move the mouse cursor to the new point or undo the scroll. As workarounds, you can lower tracking sensitivity or not use the touchpad feature at all - at which point you wasted 100 bucks for a glorified dumb mouse. The foam and the widening grips can alleviate this issue as they prevent contact from happening.So go ahead and spend 100 bucks on a stylish mouse, then spend around 30 bucks more in fixing it and you'll have the best mouse in the world . Or you can save those 100 bucks, and use the extra bucks to buy another Bluetooth mouse that will be a little less smooth and not so sexy looking but will work just fine and not give you Carpal Tunnel.",-,2023-01-06

Here is the most important thing. The Magic Mouse gestures are the reason you use this mouse. After using it for a while I can't do without the swipe and tap gestures you can do with this mouse. And it just looks right sitting next to my MacBook. I really like this mouse after getting used to it.,-,2023-01-06
 Obsessed! It's easy to connect and it really feels a lot better than my trackpad. When I'm working I need to constantly zoom in or out of things and this has made a huge difference. I'm happy with the purchase and the shipping time. The fact that I didn't have to go and pick it up from an Apple Store or wait over 3 days was such a plus. Thank you amazon prime!,-,2023-01-07
"Amazing mouse We recently switched from PC to Mac. Part of this move included the Magic Mouse. It's an incredibly comfortable mouse to use. The surface is enabled for gestures; swiping along the surface with your finger will scroll, for example. It's configurable to allow right-clicking as well. The battery life is amazing. I've only charged it once since we've had it and it's still a good week from needing a top-off. It pairs once with your mac and that's all that's ever needed. If you've got a Mac and you need a mouse, it makes sense to go with the official one. It's also a really good mouse in its own right, so the decision shouldn't be hard to make. :)",-,2023-01-07

Average or even sub-par performance is becoming far too common on Apple products, especially given their higher cost.",-,2023-01-07
" terrific Christmas gift for a student Though I am not the person who is using the silver Apple Mouse, I bought it for my grandson to go with his new Apple computer. He loves the computer and his mouse. I have used a mouse that is similar to this sleek, light, and easy to use silver mouse. Love the shape of this Apple mouse as it is contoured and fits right into the palm of your hand. Light as a feather, no long cords, easy to transport if taking the computer and mouse to school or to move to another place where you may want to study. Very good price. Got it so quickly after ordering and in plenty of time for Christmas.",-,2023-01-07
"Great design with one flaw Love the aesthetic and ergonomic design, but Apple should have corrected a design flaw by now. Since the lightning plug is on the bottom of the mouse it cannot be used while charging. I have both the mouse and trackpad, which can be used while the mouse is charging. The mouse does charge relatively quickly but this feature can be frustrating when in the middle of a project such as photo editing for which the mouse is the preferred device.",-,2023-01-07

"Gestures! I had been eyeballing either getting a trackpad or a magic mouse. One of my biggest grievances with bluetooth keyboards and mice had to do with how often I seemed to need to replace batteries. Along comes Apple with the built-in rechargeable battery magic mouse and I was sold. I've been a mac user for years and have ingrained the use of gestures using the trackpad, but I wasn't sold on using a trackpad full time. The magic mouse has the best of both worlds. At this point, using a regular mouse just won't work. I love the use of gestures while also having the accuracy of point-and-click of using a mouse. The slim design fits the profile of other mice I've used and works well for me as well. On top of it all, not only is the rechargeable functionality great, but the amount of time I've needed to spend charging both the magic mouse and keyboard because of the built-in sleep functionality can't be beat. If you're a regular mac user, you owe it to yourself to upgrade to the magic mouse.",-,2023-01-07
Wish I Switched Sooner Apple does it again. I went from a plug in mouse I used with my old Windows PC to this Bluetooth bad boy.

Great mouse!,-,2023-01-07
"poor ergonomics poor performance Was hoping the mouse wouldn't be as bad as some reviews are pointing out. Unfortunately, it's not even good enough to be 'average' in terms of comfort and performance. It does look good so it get's an extra star for that, but that's about it. Device is uncomfortable and poor to use for several reasons. It's too flat.2. Bluetooth does not deliver good enough performance for smooth pointer movement3. Does not glide well. Some good points:1. Swiping on surface of mouse is convenient.2. It's thin; good for portability.I replaced it with the Razor Orochi V2 which operates on either Bluetooth, or via a 2.4 wireless usb.At less than 1/2 the price, it glides better, can use Bluetooth in a pinch, or 2.4 wireless for really smooth pointer performance. It's compact, but taller than the apple mouse so it's more comfortable. Bottom line, I don't recommend this mouse unless you rarely use your computer and just want something nice to sit on your desk for aesthetic points.",-,2023-01-07

"The most uncomfortable $90 you will ever spend. But it looks DOPE in the advertisements! This is my second Magic Mouse 2, for the simple reason that I am fully assimilated into the Borg. As a graphic designer, the side swipe feature on the Magic Mouse 2 while using Adobe products is kind of the deal maker for me… despite after hours on this mouse, you have to check your hands to make sure you don't have stigmata, since it feels like your hand has been nailed to a piece of wood with a rusty railroad spike. That being said, it sure is puuurty in the ads and on video, but the actual ergonomics must have been engineered in a 12th century torture chamber by to succubus. I have added the aftermarket silicone bump + side ""pads"" so my mouse looks like it's ready to give birth. But at least now I can use the mouse without suffering premature arthritis, designed by Apple in California. And hey, my first one lasted almost 2 years [compared to my wife's el cheapo Logitec , which was running for more than 5 years until it went the way of the Dodo]. That's a testament to the Magic Mouse's durability, for sure. But I still love it. Because I am Apple and Apple is me.

"Long Lasting Battery I purchased this Magic Mouse 2 last year (July of 2019) and I have to say that I really like it! I upgraded from the first Magic Mouse, and I'm very glad that I did. It was very easy to pair with my iMac, and the gestures are recognized seamlessly. The battery has lasted me a few months at a time with daily, intermittent use. The only downside is that the charging port is on the bottom, so if the battery dies while you're in the middle of a project, you'll have to take a short break and charge for a few minutes, but that will be plenty to get your through the rest of the day. That's only happened to me once over the past year, so that won't affect my rating at all. I also find the mouse to be very sleek and stylish. If you're using a Mac and in the market for a mouse, I think it's worth taking advantage of all the features it has to offer.",-,2023-01-07

"Easily the worst mouse I've ever used, a joke Forced to buy into the Apple ecosystem for work, I got tired of using the touchpad on my MBP for everything and wanted to get a nice mouse. I have plenty of nice mice already but they all have USB-A connectors. The Magic Mouse is bluetooth only, and you can't use it while charging because of the bizarre decision to put the charging port on the bottom. Forget this mouse if you need accuracy or low latency. MacOS has truly atrocious mouse acceleration forced on by default, which slows your cursor when you're moving your hand slowly trying to make fine adjustments, and the only way to disable it is by entering code through the terminal. Seriously. After disabling mouse acceleration, the speed of the cursor is locked to one setting and cannot be altered, changing the cursor speed will re-enable mouse acceleration. Seriously. The sensor is unbelievably low quality, and the cursor jitters and jumps around when trying to make small adjustments, even with the mouse sitting on a high quality mousepad. It's on par with a $9.99 mouse you'd get at CVS. If you've ever used a real mouse from Logitech or Razer, this mouse will be unusable for you. I've wasted more time trying to get it feeling right than I would have saved just suffering through the MBP touchpad. Don't take my word on the awful sensor though: it's measurably, objectively, empirically terrible. The laser resolution is measured at 1300 DPI. The Logitech G502 I bought half a decade ago for half the price is configurable up to 25600 DPI, 20x the resolution and accuracy. Twenty times. For half the price.""Ergonomics"" are a cruel joke. Every other mouse I have conforms to my hand, is a nice weight, feels comfortable. A good mouse feels like it was molded for your hand, and is a natural fit. The Magic Mouse doesn't fit your hand, though. It doesn't fit anyone's hand. This mouse sacrifices all semblance of ergonomics for the sake of aesthetics. It doesn't look good, but it looks like all the other Apple products you own, and that apparently matters a lot more than it not giving you carpal tunnel. I don't understand the high ratings. This must be the only mouse they've ever used. There are other mice out there; please do yourself a favor and buy one that actually works for half the price.",-,2023-01-07

I called apple to send me a replacement (which they were happy to do) so my fingers are crossed that the new mouse will function better. I honestly prefer the old model ""roller ball"" mouse better.

It works great and it was an easy transition including the top touch scroll. Note that it comes with a USB to lightening cable, while a new MacBook Air does not have a USB port. While this mouse ultimately pairs by BlueTooth, in order to pair the first time it needs to be connected to your Mac by USB so you will also need to purchase a USB-C (MacBook Air port) to USB adapter (which I luckily had).

"High Demand Slick Magic Mouse I had two white Apple mice. One of them had battery acid from not using it for the last few years. So I decided to buy another one. I must have two - 1 for my office and the other for bedroom when I work. Anyway, my mice are over a few years old and since I was replacing the trashed one I decided to purchase this mouse. Not sure why it's more expensive then the white one. I do know that the demand for this particular color is very popular. I search my entire area for the mouse, or any apple mouse in general. I quickly learned that the Mac came out with new computers and everyone was buying them. Luckily Amazon had them in stock. So between my old white mouse and this newer one, I can tell a difference.

" Ridiculously priced (thanks Apple, thanks) my first magic mouse lasted about 8 years. for what you chanre for this? this one better as well. also: recharge on the bottom of the mouse? for a company that prides itself on design, somebody was sleeping the day this rolled out of QA",-,2023-01-08

"As an apple fan, I really tried to like this mouse but it is just bad… It is a nice looking apple device. It is very compact and fits great into my iPad carrying case. BUT, this mouse is straight uncomfortable. It is to small and hard to move around, and the touch surface is hard to 'scroll' on, the finger just won't slide properly on it. It lacks the buttons and the versatility of other mice. Vendor wise, I have no issues, it arrived quickly, in original box",-,2023-01-08
 Really nice device I am in love with this device. The battery lasts forever and not complicated to adapt. It does have left and right click you or you need to enable that. The only down it's that is not really ergonomic so please purchase a case and a protection with it. Also if you use it bear accumulated dirt out of one finger that you click. Be careful with that,-,2023-01-08
"Forget ergonomics This is okay for clicking around on the screen, but it is really uncomfortable! There is no ergonomic design to this device. Scrolling up/down is the worst. I do not recommend this product.",-,2023-01-08
" Still linked to old user The mouse works just fine. However, when I got the product, it was packaged in the original box...and it was filthy, the box and mouse. The mouse was literally BROWN and all scratched up. I bought the used mouse, I expected some wear and tear but not filthy. The mouse is also still attached to the old user and I cannot figure out how to unlink the name. Like I said, the mouse seems to be working just fine but it is annoying not being able to put my name with the mouse.",-,2023-01-08
 Apple Mouse Awesome product like all Apple products.,-,2023-01-08
"Poor design and ergonomics Yeah sure gestures work but the compromises… like the title of this review, ergonomics are awful, plus dpi is low making tracking on the screen imprecise, annoying, and slow even at the highest track speeds. Returning this.",-,2023-01-08

" Worth the money! Great battery life!! I love this mouse. I am a graphic design student and was looking for a Bluetooth mouse for my laptop and this works wonderfully. The battery life is absolutely incredible. I came back to write a review because I was so pleased with it. I got the mouse fully charged about four months ago and the charge is just now down to 70%. Sleep mode is also very nice. I sometimes forget to turn it off between working or overnight and it still has a ton of charge. I was a little nervous after reading reviews about how it caused hand cramps and pain, but I haven't experienced anything of the sort.",-,2023-01-08
 It's a mouse It's magic! Except the whole “have to turn it on its side to recharge it” bit.,-,2023-01-08
"Can't charge while in use The mouse works fantastically, but the battery isn't replaceable like the old Magic Mouse (2 AA batteries) and they put the plug to charge this on the bottom instead of the front of the mouse, so it can't be used while charging.",-,2023-01-08

" Magic Mouse keeps getting better! With my MacBook Pro I also ordered the latest Magic Mouse. This device comes with USB C to lighting cable so that the new MacBook pro USB-C can be used to charge it.No major visual changes have been made to the new gen magic mouse although i feel its easier and more smoother than the previous model . The battery charge retention too is extended by about 20% than its predecessor. Overall, the Magic mouse continues to be my favorite of them all.",-,2023-01-08
"Great mouse for my Macbook pro I ordered this mouse to use with my MacBook pro for when I dj. Well, it's so good that I'd rather use it even when I'm not dj'nLolI love this mouse. Connects pretty fast and battery life is very good on it.",-,2023-01-08
" Worked right out of the box, once it was paired. Love this mouse. Very ergo for me and the price was better than all the local stores. Fastest delivery ever.",-,2023-01-08
 Have a different feel Battery life is great. Haven't gone that long but would bet a week with regular use would be probable. Feels good. smooth. Only thing I have noticed is is fingers are least bit not dry they don't slide smoothly on mouse surface. Bit not a negative at all. would buy again,-,2023-01-08

 Great mouse. I really like it so far. We shall see if it gives many years of reliability.,-,2023-01-08
"An investment you won't regret!! Apple's Magic Mouse 2 is completely worth the money! It's so simple to use, just turn on the switch button on the bottom, (have your connecting device's Bluetooth on of course) and within less than 2 minutes you're good to go. Not only does it look great with the glass top but it's easy to clean. The battery life is great too, accidentally left my mouse on during the night and once I turned on my laptop the next morning (~12pm) my mouse had only lost 2% battery life! Other awesome perks to the mouse, in its systems preferences you get to choose the exact speed & customize each click to do what you want. Do yourself in favor and make the investment.",-,2023-01-08
