"March 17, 2025","I’ve been using the Apple Magic Mouse for a few months now, and I can confidently say it’s one of the best mice I’ve ever had! First off, the design is incredibly sleek and minimalistic, which fits perfectly with my Mac setup. The wireless Bluetooth connection is seamless, and I’ve had zero issues with lag or disconnection.The multi-touch surface is a game-changer. I love how easy it is to navigate through pages and apps with gestures like swiping and scrolling. It makes using the mouse so much more intuitive and enjoyable, especially when multitasking between different apps and windows.The rechargeable battery is another huge plus. I’ve only had to charge it a few times, and it lasts for a surprisingly long time. It’s so much more convenient than dealing with disposable batteries.Overall, the Magic Mouse is smooth, responsive, and looks great on my desk. If you're in the Apple ecosystem and looking for a mouse that works effortlessly with your Mac or iPad, this is definitely the way to go. Highly recommend!"
"March 17, 2025","This is the best addition to any MacBook Pro ever! The pad is extremely awkward to use if you’re a first time MacBook Pro owner. This is our first MacBook Pro and it has a learning curve that you have to get use to using if you want to use the love that it is wireless via Bluetooth and eliminates the need for using one of the few USB ports on the MacBook Pro. It makes using your MacBook more convenient and easy to navigate than using the pad that is built into the laptop. Our MacBook Pro is the space gray version and we bought the same color mouse. I’ve used the wired mouse on the older Apple Mini Macs in the past and it was just a little bit different than what I was use to using which was a Windows OS mouse. If you’re a first time MacBook Pro user, you should invest in this mouse. The charge is great and last for several days or hours depending on how long you use your MacBook. The pad is a real learning curve and this will help eliminate a lot of frustration when you are a new MacBook Pro owner.As far as gaming goes, I can’t exactly say how well it works as I am not a gamer. But the response time , in my opinion, is fast and I think there are other options for gamers that are really into gaming that own a MacBook Pro and I’m sure they are aware of those options.I have owned three apple desktop counting the latest MacBook Pro and those both had a wired mouse and keyboard that was separate from the Mini Mac. Sitting down with my new laptop was quite a different experience than the other Apple desktop’s that we have had in the past and it is not like a Windows laptop in the way the pad works , but this was worth the price of not relying on the built in touchpad which I had a lot of learning to do if I was going to rely on the MacBook Pro built in pad.  Not a big fan of the white keyboard and mouse as we have had two different sets of the white items and they start to look kind of dirty after a few months of use. The one thing I absolutely miss about the older Mac Minis that ran on the Intel processor is that the newer M3 chipsets don’t have the ability to run Parallel’s which most people know what that means. I don’t really miss the ability to use Windows on my MacBook Pro now anyway because it was always the source of all of the problems we had with the older Mac minis in terms of malware and viruses. I do however miss the CD or DVD drive as well because I have a lot of Japanese MQA CDs and they can be unfolded to enjoy the full potential with a external drive and the software that you can buy for the MacBook Pro. It gets the most use as a MQA decoder than any other type of computer usage. We have the newest iPad Pro versions and they are almost as good as the MacBook Pro. I have heard that the newer versions that are coming out are going to be basically the “MacBook Pro Killer” as they are supposedly going to have a lot more RAM and powerful processors and the ability to run programs that only a desktop or MacBook Pro can handle now. But I think the price point is probably going to be outrageous for most people.My only regret is that I didn’t get the MacBook Pro Bluetooth keyboard in the space gray when they were more a available, because they are extremely hard to find now and expensive in comparison to the standard white model. The keyboard has to have the finger print reader on it as I would like to sit in in a cradle instead of having it opened up on my workstation. So that makes it even more difficult to find and expensive. I have seen used ones sell for twice the price of the new white version, but it is the only thing that is really left to buy for this set up."
"March 16, 2025","I absolutely love the Apple Magic Mouse! It’s sleek, lightweight, and fits perfectly in my hand. The multi-touch surface makes navigation smooth and intuitive, whether I’m using it with my Mac or iPad. The rechargeable battery lasts a long time, and pairing via Bluetooth is seamless. It’s a joy to use and looks great on my desk. Highly recommend it!"
"March 14, 2025",Very happy with this purchase. Easy to connect with any Mac. The quality feels very nice and durable. Pay a lot more because this mouse is worth it. Love the glide to slide through pages. No lag. Great click feel and noice. Functionality is great and does all that you need it to do.
"March 13, 2025","I have been super excited to try the Apple Magic Mouse.  I finally bought one yesterday.  I was able to get it same day since I live close to a distribution center!Here are my thoughts:Likes:Build Quality and Design: The Magic Mouse lives up to Apple’s reputation for premium build quality and sleek, modern aesthetics. It fits perfectly with my Apple Magic Keyboard and looks fantastic on my desk.Trackpad Surface: The multi-touch surface is truly a game-changer. It allows for intuitive gestures like swiping and scrolling, making navigation smooth and effortless.  Seriously, it took almost no time for me to realize this is better and easier than using a trackwheel or left/right mouse buttons.Seamless Connectivity: Pairing the mouse with my Mac was a breeze, thanks to its flawless Bluetooth connection. The connection remains stable, ensuring uninterrupted productivity.I am coming from a Satechi setup.  In all three of these areas, Apple's Magic Mouse is superior.  However, this in no way implies the Satechi setup is bad.  I guess it's all about bang for the buck.  Apple's setup is substantially more money.Dislikes:Scrolling Speed Adjustment: I had to make changes to the scrolling speed in the settings to suit my preference. While this wasn’t a major issue, it did require some extra time.  It would be ideal of Apple could figure out how optimize this out of the box, by making adjustments based on your existing mouse and settings.Charging Port Placement: The charging port being located on the bottom of the mouse is less than ideal. It makes it impossible to use the mouse while it’s charging, which can be quite inconvenient.Price: The Magic Mouse is on the pricier side for a mouse. Although it offers excellent features and design, the cost may be a consideration for some.Additional Insights from Other Users:Many users have praised the Magic Mouse for its sleek design, intuitive multi-touch surface, and seamless connectivity. The rechargeable battery and its long-lasting charge have been highlighted as significant improvements over previous models. Some users have noted the excellent performance in detailed tasks like graphic design and photo editing. However, the placement of the charging port and the high price point were common points of criticism.In summary, the Apple Magic Mouse is a perfect blend of style and functionality. Whether you’re a professional or a casual user, this mouse is bound to elevate your computing experience. Highly recommended, despite a few minor drawbacks."
"March 13, 2025","UPDATE 01/25/2025:Reduced a star, Magic Trackpad battery life has been barely lasting 2 weeks, turned off several gestures and will have to see if there are improvements. If abttery life lasts 1 month, that's reasonable, but 1-2 weeks of battery draining so much is a bit excessive. Will update again after a month.Reasons to get a Magic Mouse (USB-C) over the Magic Trackpad (USB-C)• Greater precision when selecting specific points• Greater accuracy when clicking, holding, and dragging (for highlighting text, or signing a signature)• Cheaper price $99 (on sale for $80 black friday/ holidays) vs $149 (no sale was seen)• Cleaner desk layout when paired with a magic keyboard and having the macbook on a stand• Better battery lifeReason to get a Magic Trackpad (USB-C) over the Magic Mouse (USB-C):• Larger surface area, greater range of movement/ motion without physically moving hand• Many gestures and better usage of gestures compared to magic mouse (such as two finger zoom, on the mouse you can only double tap to zoom and it is limited as it zooms for you rather than you choosing how much to zoom yourself)• Can charge the trackpad while still using it• Great to use for creative programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and the likes (being able to use your finger for tools such as brush, pencil, pen, ... is much easier to use, drawing with finger is somewhat equivalent to drawing with a pencil)Regardless of whichever device you choose to purchase, go to your system settings by clicking the apple logo at the top left of your screen, go to bluetooth, click info (i in a circle) on either the magic trackpad/ mouse, then click trackpad/ mouse settings. Here you will be able to customize the gestures and movement to your liking.TLDR: If you are a creative I recommend the trackpad for greater range of movement/ expression (especially if macbook is elevated on a stand), if you want a clean desk layout the magic mouse is a nice addition to the built-in macbook trackpad.However if you're not looking to stay in the apple ecosystem, there are better mouse options out there.It's nice to finally have usb-c across many apple products. Main reason I stopped using some products was because having a lightning cable was just inconvenient."
"March 12, 2025","I recently purchased the Apple Magic Mouse to pair with my MacBook, and overall, it works well with the Apple ecosystem. The sleek design is what you’d expect from Apple—modern and compact. It fits well with my minimalist setup.Some key points: • Great Integration: The mouse connects instantly with my MacBook, and I appreciate the smooth multi-touch gestures for scrolling and swiping. • Battery Life: The rechargeable battery is long-lasting. I only need to charge it occasionally, which is convenient.That said, the flat design can be a little uncomfortable for extended use, especially if you’re used to a more ergonomic mouse. Also, it’s on the pricier side, so I expected a little more in terms of comfort.If you’re in the Apple ecosystem and value design, it’s a great choice, but there are more comfortable options available for heavy use."
"March 11, 2025","These mice are simply the best you can get for your Mac (I haven't tried one on a PC but now that I think of it, I think I will, just to see how functional they are). The top of the mouse is a touch-sensitive surface and you can scroll, zoom, switch desktops and perform many other functions with just fingertip(s) on the surface. They are wonderfully ergonomic and make mousing a breeze. I am a computer professional and often spend entire days using the mouse almost constantly; I've never used a better one. They are solidly built and are rechargeable. I am currently using a Magic Mouse I got in 2016; I've never had to change a battery or do more than clean it now and then. I have several others for the other computers in my home and offices; I have never had a problem with any of them. Not one.The only design flaw with this device is the charging port. It was put on the bottom of the mouse and connecting a lightning cable to recharge it means that you cannot use it while it is charging. This is not a problem for me; at the end of every month, when finishing for the night, I connect both the mouse and my wireless keyboard and leave them overnight; in the morning they are 100%. All the same, I wish that Apple had put the charging port on the ""nose"" (front) of the mouse so that it could function like a regular wired mouse while charging. They charge VERY quickly too."
"March 11, 2025","A Love Story of Form Over FunctionThere it sits on my desk, a gleaming slice of minimalist beauty, mocking me with its perfectly curved surface and seamless touch controls. Like a toxic relationship I can't seem to escape, I keep coming back to the Magic Mouse despite knowing better. And yes, I too own multiple, as if collecting them might somehow justify the cognitive dissonance.Let's address the elephant in the room: charging it requires flipping it on its back like a helpless turtle, rendering it temporarily useless. It's perhaps the most infamous example of Apple's occasional triumph of aesthetics over practicality. Yet somehow, this design choice feels almost poetic in its absurdity – a metaphor for our willingness to sacrifice convenience for style.The touch surface is simultaneously brilliant and maddening. Gestures flow like water when they work, letting you swipe between pages with the grace of a digital ballet dancer. But attempt to scroll precisely through a document, and you'll find yourself performing micro-adjustments worthy of a brain surgeon.The ergonomics? Well, if you enjoy gripping a bar of soap made of aluminum and glass, you're in for a treat. The low profile forces your hand into a position that would make an ergonomist weep. Yet here I am, day after day, choosing this sleek rectangle over more comfortable alternatives, like someone who keeps wearing uncomfortable shoes because they look fantastic.Why do we do this to ourselves? Perhaps it's the way it perfectly matches our other Apple devices, creating that satisfying aesthetic harmony on our desks. Or maybe it's Stockholm syndrome, developed over years of Apple ecosystem investment.The Magic Mouse is a testament to our willingness to embrace beautiful imperfection. It's not the best mouse – not by a long shot – but like a painting that's slightly askew that you refuse to straighten, it has become part of your identity. It's a small act of defiance against pure rationality, choosing form over function while being fully aware of the trade-off.And so here we sit, you and I, with our collection of Magic Mice, simultaneously frustrated and captivated by their elegant flaws. At least they look good sitting there while we complain about them."
"March 9, 2025","I think this is possibly the worst designed product Apple has ever made, in my opinion. I see it as putting form well above function. It was like Apple decided to combine a mouse with a trackpad. In this case, the tracking is done by moving the trackpad around as opposed to using the pad to track. If I remember correctly, someone else on here referred to this mouse as an ergonomic disaster and I have to agree. The sides of this mouse are sharp and pinching with barely anything to grab on to. It appears the mouse was not designed with a consideration for where to put thumbs and any other fingers people might need to use to hold on to a mouse, or at least a spot where they can rest those fingers so they're not in the way. What's more, if my thumb drops as it is inclined to do due to gravity and because it is in pursuit of a stronger grip then my thumb gets pinched between the silver base and the white top part of the mouse that functions like a giant mouse button. It's like my thumb is in the way of this mouse doing what it wants to do. On the opposite side, my little finger gets dragged and pushed around on the mousepad as it has no place to go.To make matters worse, the white touch surface top does not feel secure. It rocks sideways ever so slightly. That loose top gets tiring after a while and I think it may be in part responsible for my struggles getting the mouse to start selecting text on the letter that I want it to start selecting on.The flat white surface of the mouse, the mini trackpad that doesn't track, is good for quick scrolling but there's a catch, I find it gets tiring after a while because my pointer finger is repeatedly hitting and gliding over a hard surface. Sometimes my fingernail scrapes along the surface as well. It was after my fingernail got caught scraping the top of the mouse while scrolling one day that led me to say to myself enough, I'm not using this anymore. In addition to the scrolling getting tired after a while, my index finger does drift over to the middle of the mouse. Having used ergonomic mice, I now believe that the flat shape is in part responsible because there is so little for my hand to grip on to. The drifting leads left clicks to turn into right clicks. It is annoying when I occasionally click on something expecting to select it or what not, only to see the context menu pop up instead. I also got this mouse for my mother to use and her finger drifts over to the right so often that I decided to turn off the right click function to help her out. She doesn't use the right click button so she isn't missing anything but others might have use for the right click button. Despite that, the scrolling feature gets in her way still and she uses that. Another issue both of us have with scrolling, and this is one of the most annoying things about this mouse, is that we often, her more than me I think, find ourselves scrolling sideways while scrolling down or up when we just want to scroll down or up. I've never had that issue on mice with scroll wheels, or any other mouse for that matter. There'd be times when I'd have what I'm looking at lined up just right and then when I scroll, I can't scroll down or up in a straight line with out it moving sideways at some point. Another annoying thing about the touch surface of the mouse is that occasionally I'll brush it with my finger when I'm in the process of putting my hand back on to the mouse after typing on the keyboard. That leads to something happening that I didn't want which needs to then be corrected.One of the bonuses of the touch surface is that it opens the door for tapping and swiping, adding functionality without the need for buttons. I never got comfortable with swiping on a mouse, while I just used tapping in order to use Mission Control. The way it is set up requires a double two-finger tap on the touch surface but what feels like half the time, I don't tap the top of the mouse right and I have to do it again until I get Mission Control to work. That issue didn't go away over time with practice. Tapping, for me, is not a replacement for a third button on a traditional mouse.Another negative, and this one is talked about a lot, is that the lightning port used for recharging is on the underside of the mouse which means in order to recharge the mouse it has to be on its side or laying down with its belly up. That of course means you can't recharge the mouse and use it at the same time.To make matters worse, there aren't many positives I find with this mouse. It is Apple's mouse, for one, and for that you are assured lasting compatibility with Macs. I've had multiple experiences where Logitech mice all of a sudden don't work properly or are not compatible after an update or with a new Mac. Two, the battery lasts a good amount of time. Maybe up to three months on a single charge. That seems good to me. However, I did encounter an issue when I recharged the mouse the first time. Despite following the directions on how to check when the mouse is fully charged, when I went to use it again the following morning I noticed that the charge was at 74%. It was at 12% before I recharged it the night before and said it was at 100% when I unplugged it. I had to recharge it a second time in order to get it up to 100%. Hopefully, that was just a one time issue. The third positive is that the mouse is lightweight. I prefer lightweight mice but in this case, it doesn't make up for the drawbacks. The fourth positive is that its shape and weight makes it easy to fit in a bag or in a pocket.In the end, the positives do not come close to outweighing its negatives for me. The key phrase is, ""for me,"" as there are people out there that prefer tapping and swiping and smaller mice. From my experience, seeing my mother's struggles and reading other reviews, this mouse is simply not for everyone and I don't fully understand why Apple designed it the way they did. Too much form over function to me. I would take a corded mouse over this one if I had to. Unless you prefer mice like the Apple Magic Mouse as opposed to a traditional style mouse with scroll wheels and a mouse like shape, I'd recommend trying out other mice first before paying for this one. Chances are you'll find something that's more comfortable and less frustrating to use for less money. But if you are willing to spend a bit more. Then there are mice out there like the Logitech MX Master which are designed to be more comfortable, may even feel like they are better made than the Magic Mouse, while having more features and capabilities."
"March 4, 2025","The Apple Magic Mouse is a game-changer for anyone in the Apple ecosystem. Its sleek, minimalist design fits perfectly in my workspace, and the touch-sensitive surface allows for seamless scrolling, swiping, and gestures—just like on a MacBook trackpad.I was initially skeptical about its ergonomic comfort, but after using it for extended periods, I found it to be lightweight and easy to maneuver. The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless, and the battery life is incredible, lasting weeks on a single charge.One downside? The charging port placement on the bottom means you can’t use it while charging—but with such a long battery life, I rarely find it to be an issue.If you’re a Mac user looking for a premium, smooth, and intuitive experience, the Apple Magic Mouse is well worth it. Highly recommend!"
"February 21, 2025",Always loved the magic mouse aside from where the charging port is located. But now it's even better with USB-C charging!You definitely can't go wrong with this mouse if you are a macbook user!
"February 21, 2025",This mouse is amazing… it is the first time I use a Mac but I’m surprised how you can move between the different windows you use.
"February 20, 2025",No more messy cord. Can be handed off to a visitor to my office. Functions perfectly. Completely adjustable in settings. Teeny-tiny complaint; grip could be more like the competition (Logi).
"February 19, 2025","I’ve been using the Apple Mouse for several weeks now, and I’m thoroughly impressed with its performance and design. The sleek, minimalist look fits perfectly with my Apple setup, and it feels incredibly solid and premium in hand. The smooth, responsive surface makes scrolling through documents and websites a breeze, and the multi-touch capabilities for gestures are intuitive and work flawlessly. I especially love the ability to swipe between pages and switch apps with a simple gesture—it’s a real productivity booster.The comfort is surprisingly good too. While it’s low-profile, the design fits my hand well and doesn’t cause discomfort even after long hours of use, which was a concern for me at first. The precision is excellent for both everyday tasks and more detailed work like photo editing.One minor downside is that the charging method via Lightning cable can be a bit inconvenient, as you can’t use it while charging. However, the battery life lasts a long time between charges, so it’s not something I have to worry about frequently.Overall, the Apple Mouse offers an excellent balance of style, functionality, and ease of use, and it’s a great addition to any Apple user’s workspace. It’s well worth the investment if you’re looking for a reliable, high-quality mouse."
"February 17, 2025","When I worked in IT, I set up a MacBook with one of these and silently ridiculed the user for needing such a fancy/schmancy mouse: a ten-dollar mouse with a forty-dollar logo. That was until I used it. So now I have a fancy/schmancy mouse that’s worth every penny, except for the location of the charging port, which make the unit unusable when charging."
"February 17, 2025","Awesome mouse. I love the way it works. The white looks great and the glass feels great. I think it’s worth the money. The one problem I had was the packaging. When it arrived, the mouse was out of the box. The box was open and everything was spilled out around the rest of my package. Thankfully, somehow nothing was damaged, despite the box having no safe packaging material. Everything still works though"
"February 14, 2025",I love it! Is perfect :)
"February 13, 2025",Excelente service and product condition
"February 11, 2025","Absolutely the best mouse I’ve ever owned in my life. High-quality well-made, super functional, not noisy, very smooth, good grip, no lag, extremely durable, very fast, Bluetooth mouse you need this if you have an Apple air book or laptop."
"February 9, 2025","This review is for the USB-C version of the Magic Mouse only.When I bought this mouse, there was no disclaimer that it will properly perform only on Sequoia 15.1.1 Apple said that it worked with OS's back prior to Ventura, so I felt safe.  (To be fair, I do not know whether it works on the beta release of Sequoia 15.2).I was running Ventura 13.6, and when I connected the Magic Mouse, it only functioned as a regular mouse - no gesturing, no scrolling, etc.  Button clicks kind of worked, but not always.  I tried it on multiple macs, but the results were the same.I returned it, and purchased a replacement:  same results.  After doing some research, I found others that were having similar results, and finally saw that people had isolated it to only working as advertised on Sequoia 15.1.1.After upgrading my macOS to Sequoia 15.1.1, the USB-C Magic Mouse works as advertised.I hope that Apple does the right thing and a) publishes a note regarding the compatibility issue, and b) issues a patch to Ventura, Sonoma so they, too, will enable this terrific mouse to work as intended."
"February 9, 2025",I bought this to replace one I have been using for several years. Little did I know I needed to be running Sequoia in order for it to work properly. It connected and would move and click but none of the other options for the mouse were available. My fault for not paying attention.
"February 9, 2025","Often Apple products have a layer of quality, feel, integration, features or ease of use that distinguish them from the competition. This is not true here. While the quality and build are solid- this is a mouse- that at least with respect to the IPad Air M2 is comparable performance wise with products costing less than half.Functionality wise, other than a few gestures that are useful- I found a much less expensive Logitech mouse to be slightly more responsive. While the Logitech mouse uses a scroll wheel- it was no more laggy than the Magic Mouse.On the Mac Air, I have another Logitech mouse, again much less expensive, that meets my needs extremely well.This review is not intended to be a commercial for Logitech- but only to highlight that with respect to the Magic Mouse, the value proposition is not quite there. The build quality of the Magic Mouse is excellent, but the overall performance and ergonomics don’t seem to justify the price."
"February 7, 2025","With a simple flick of the button, I can effortlessly use the device wherever I need it. Its lightweight design makes it incredibly portable, easily sliding into my pocket when I’m on the go."
"February 6, 2025","I have had apple mouses before but I didn't even connect them to my computers.  Today, my new mouse arrived.  I was worried I would have problems ""getting"" the technology.... This mouse was a plug and play and it is awesome.  Not only does it work well, but it is beautiful."
"February 6, 2025","Be aware- if used with any Mac running any OS except Sequoia, you will not have full features- Magic Touch on this mouse will ONLY work with OS Sequoia or later. I found out the hard way by thinking I had a defective one the first time, as it failed to work with my old Mac as well. Why Apple would do this is beyond me, but it’s Apple (eye roll). It is hard to find this out on line, and Apple simply states on the box ‘requires Mac with the latest version of macOS’, with any specifics."
"February 3, 2025","Amazing mouse, it’s essentially a trackpad/mouse combo, I love it! Read many 50/50 reviews and was on the fence, couldn’t be happier I went for it! This mouse really help my productivity between three screens!!Also for me I experienced zero carpal tunnel using this mouse, in fact my wrist felt better after a 40-50 hour week!!"
"February 3, 2025","Initially I did not expect to like this mouse so much. Simple, small, unlit. Fits my small hand perfectly. Love the easy to use touch surface. Though I do wish the keyboard was lit, this mouse does not need it. Stays charged for a long time. Perfect mouse!"
"February 2, 2025","I only give it 4 stars for several reasons that are specific to iPad users, I believe:1. The top is very slick and easy to use finger gestures, whether deliberately or by accident. It takes some practice to keep your finger(s) floating over the mouse rather than resting on it. It’s too easy to move screen objects by accident with accidental finger movement on the mouse. I’m guessing this is more of a problem on an iPad than a Mac, because of the iPad’s sensitive touch screen.2. On an iPad, you don’t get a slanted arrow mouse pointer like on a Mac. Instead, you get a circle moving on the screen. Where the exact pointer is on an iPad is anyone’s guess.3. It’s easy to hold the mouse tilted to one side rather than in a straight North to South direction. This impacts how it behaves if you think you’re moving the mouse up when in reality you’re “up movement” is actually sliding sliding the mouse sideways.Finger gestures on top of the mouse is just one more way to control your iPad. Now I have my choice of using the Home button, the Apple Pencil, the Apple Magic Keyboard, or the Apple Magic Mouse. I bought the mouse for apps that I could not control with the keyboard, the pencil or my third-party mouse.It was maddening having a 3rd party mouse with a scrollwheel, which wouldn’t scroll.I know a lot of people are happy using 3rd party accessories on their Macs and iPads. I’ve had bad experiences with 3rd party keyboards and mice. If they don’t work exactly like Apple’s, then I feel I’ve only gotten what I paid for. The extra money I spend on Apple Accessories saves me time and frustration—that makes the added expense worth it, for me."
"February 2, 2025","Who cares if the charging port is on the bottom, you don't need to charge often . Works perfect with my MacBook M1Pro glad I picked this over the setachi or mx anywhere. Magic Mouse is superior! I would not buy this used my last 2 I bought used and did not have good outcomes with those this is the one now my setup is complete."
"February 2, 2025",requires continued use to get used to cordless use

"February 2, 2025","Purchased for a new MacBook Pro. Battery life is terrific, pairs via bluetooth. The only dumb thing is the charge port is on the bottom of the mouse so you can't charge and use at the same time. Since it charges so fast it's really not a big deal."
"February 2, 2025",A classic! but now with USB -C and at 20% discount when bought in December 2024
"January 30, 2025","I like that it's cordless, but it's a little harder to manipulate than the old, corded mouse, even though I got a special mouse pad for it."
"January 30, 2025","Great product, good mouse quality"
"January 28, 2025",Works great and connected to my MacBook without any issues.
"January 23, 2025",Apple works with apple. Had other wireless mice but always a problem. The wireless apple mouse no problem.
"January 23, 2025","high quality build, great integration on all apple hardware, and great battery life. been using this brand / type of Apple mouse since it was available back in 2010. Ive since owned several for my marketing business. the bad: charging port on bottom of mouse, cant use and charge at the same time."
"January 20, 2025",Great mouse.  It's smooth and works really well.  I just wish I could figure out the scroll.
"January 19, 2025",Its a great mouse to compliment my mac. Intuitive to use and looks amazing!
"January 19, 2025","I bought this because I edit a lot of pictures mostly using a laptop, it’s more comfortable using a mouse. I’m surprised with long the battery lasts. Initially it wasn’t accepting gestures but after a few adjustments in the settings it works perfectly"
"January 18, 2025","I bought this because I was tired of my other $20 dollar mouse not working great with the Mac, between the terrible scrolling quality and the connectivity issues, I just decided to make the great plunge and get the Magic Mouse. But, I am so happy I did, it works amazing. The agronomics of it could be better, but I don't necessarily mind because I am young. But the scrolling works great, it feels like using the trackpad on the Mac, but in a mouse form. I recently have done some video editing for a trip I took and I could not imagine using another mouse for that just because the Magic Mouse allows you not only to scroll up and down, but side to side like a trackpad. Some people complain about the charging method, but for me, I have a widget on my desktop that shows the battery percentage of my devices and when I see the mouse is low, when I go to take a break or log off for the day, I plug it in, no big deal. Would buy again, 100%. My only true complaint with the mouse is that it still only charge via lightening port and not USB-C, hopefully they fix that soon!"
"January 18, 2025","The only problem I have with the mouse is the fact that it's really not ergonomic at all, but that doesn't really matter. My problem is with the scroll wheel. for some reason the scrolling on macos is inverted, and when you try to fix it, the track pad becomes inverted. its so stupid really."
"January 18, 2025",Works great - long battery life - ease of use and quick response.
"January 16, 2025",Tried using an off-brand magic mouse first and was causing power issues with my Macbook so I opted for the more expensive Apple Magic Mouse that I was used to from my previous job. Works great. I am a video editor and I love being able to scroll without a wheel in the direction that I need without having to hold down a keyboard button to change directions between horizontal or vertical scrolling. My only complaint with the Apple Magic Mouse is the charging location which is on the bottom and renders the mouse useless while charging. This has been a problem ever since they created these but thankfully the battery lasts a long time before needing to recharge. This is definitely my favorite mouse to use with a Macbook.
"January 16, 2025",I realize I like this mouse and I’ll keep it.
"January 12, 2025","Apple products just seem to work very well.  I've tried the non-Apple products and have been disappointed every time!  The Apple Magic Mouse works great as did the other  Apple Magic Mouses.  Charging  it was funny, you lay the mouse upside down and connect the charger to the bottom side.  Great product.  Charges last a long time."
"January 11, 2025","The nice thing about Apple products is how easily they work with their other devices.  Connecting this Magic Mouse to my MacBook was seamless and took less than a minute.  This replaced a previous generation Magic Mouse (with AA batteries) that worked for 9 years until it died - not bad these days.  There's only two things I'd like to see Apple change on the generation of the Magic Mouse:#1 - Can we PLEASE stop using the old Lightning ports?  This mouse uses one for recharging (and it comes with a Lightning cable).  But the trend for the last couple of years has been to phase out the Lightning ports and cables in favor of USB-C.  I'd like to not have to have specific cables for specific devices any more.#2 - For some reason (likely aesthetics), the charging port is on the bottom of the Magic Mouse.  This, of course, renders the mouse useless when charging.  Apple need to take a cue from Logitech which places their charging port (a USB-C) on the front of their rechargeable mouses (mice?) so you can still use those while they refuel.  This charging port location is a rare bad design from Apple."
"January 9, 2025","I am an apple fan and I like the mouse. As with most things, genuine apple products work better with my Mac than off brands. That said they are pricier. I also like some of the features (clicking and rolling bar) better on generic versions. I am sticking with this one, though, because it works well with my computer set-up."
"January 9, 2025",Really wanted to like this but just too uncomfortable for my hands. Very low profile places the wrist on the work surface and no support while the hand is curled holding the mouse. Love the intuitive finger scrolling but after an hour I found myself wanting to stop using it. If you have super small hands this may work out.
"January 6, 2025",Worked as promised
"January 5, 2025",10/10 recommend.
"January 1, 2025","I don’t know who would enjoy using this kind of mouse. The design is impractical and not ergonomic. Plus, the charging slot is right underneath, so you have to flip it over to charge. The quality seems good, and compatibility with Apple computers is fast and easy, but I would never buy it again."
"December 31, 2024",The Mouse works perfectly!!!
"December 20, 2024","Awkward to hold. Don’t like the lightning charging port on bottom of mouse or absence of some kind of charge status - have to check settings in Macbook to see charge status. Does hold a charge very well though, but takes a long time to charge it up."
"December 19, 2024",This is one of the best BT mice on the market.I use this when traveling.  I normally use a track pad when in my office.
"December 19, 2024","Initially, I was skeptical given all the negative reviews on the mouse primarily for its ergonomic features. I'll admit, it's not a mouse I would use all day, and when I first used it, I did experience slight discomfort in my wrist. Frankly, I think many people are exaggerating though. This mouse along with all of its features makes using it a fun and productive experience. Take the negative comments about this mouse with a grain of salt, because in reality, it is a great product. As for the charging port on the bottom, it's whatever really, I bought this mouse months ago, and still has over 75% battery, so in reality, again, another problem people are blowing out of proportion. Definitely buy it!"
"December 15, 2024",Have been using for a while now.  I love it!
"December 15, 2024","I recently purchased the Apple Magic Mouse, and it has been a fantastic addition to my workspace. Here’s why I’m giving it a full 5-star rating:**Design:**The sleek, minimalist design of the Magic Mouse is both aesthetically pleasing and ergonomically comfortable. It fits perfectly in my hand, and the smooth, seamless surface feels great to the touch.**Touch Surface:**The multi-touch surface is incredibly responsive and intuitive. It allows for effortless scrolling, swiping, and clicking. The gestures make navigating through documents, web pages, and applications smooth and efficient.**Connectivity:**Connecting the Magic Mouse to my Mac was a breeze. It paired instantly via Bluetooth, and I haven’t experienced any connectivity issues. It’s a seamless experience from setup to daily use.**Battery Life:**The rechargeable battery is a significant improvement over the previous models. A single charge lasts for weeks, and the quick charge feature is handy when I need a quick boost of power.**Performance:**The tracking is precise, and the cursor movement is smooth and accurate. Whether I’m doing detailed graphic design work or simply browsing the web, the Magic Mouse performs flawlessly.**Compatibility:**The Magic Mouse works perfectly with macOS, taking full advantage of all the gesture controls and features. It’s also compatible with my iPad, adding to its versatility.**Build Quality:**As expected from Apple, the build quality is top-notch. It feels solid and durable, promising long-term reliability.Overall, the Apple Magic Mouse is a must-have accessory for any Mac user. Its sleek design, intuitive touch surface, and excellent performance make it well worth the investment. Highly recommended!"
"December 15, 2024","I really want to love it because I LOVE some of the touchpad-like functionality. But as many others have said, the ergonomics are really poor. I’ve considered getting some of the ergonomic accessories/add-ons, but it’s also a little heavy, and takes a bit more effort to engage a click than feels healthy. Wish it had tap to click! (I actually tried a third-party app to help with that – but while it added the functionality, it was a bit buggy/jumpy, so I didn’t keep using it.)Alas, this little guy is getting returned… Keeping it at 3 stars rather than 2 because for someone who is only a light computer user, it might be okay. But I have to use it for my remote computer job, for both design and admin."
"December 10, 2024",I loved that the Apple mouse is easy to use and makes it easy for me to scroll
"December 9, 2024","It's pretty hard to precisely aim it onto any small object (such as a close button or edge of a browser to drag or some position somewhere in a typed word) with acceleration turned on or off. It's super weird that I need to lift my middle finger from the mouse to use inertia scroll; if my middle finger is resting on the mouse, index finger scrolling doesn't have inertia. And of course, there's the famous charging port on the bottom. Other than that, it's quite nice, well built, and pleasing to use mouse. Oh, and it pinches fingers that I hold it with on the sides on every click, because entire top surface goes down."
"November 30, 2024",Mouse for MacBook Air
"November 29, 2024","I recently got my hands on the Apple Magic Mouse, and it has been a revelation! Here's why it deserves all five stars:Sleek Design: True to Apple's signature style, the Magic Mouse is a minimalist's dream. Its white, glossy finish is not just a visual treat but also complements my Mac and iPad perfectly.Seamless Connectivity: The Bluetooth connection is flawless. Pairing it with my devices took mere seconds, and the connection remains stable, ensuring uninterrupted productivity.Rechargeable Convenience: The built-in rechargeable battery is a huge plus. It charges quickly and lasts for weeks, eliminating the hassle and expense of constantly replacing batteries.Multi-Touch Surface: This feature is an absolute game-changer. The Multi-Touch surface allows for intuitive gestures like swiping between web pages and scrolling through documents. It makes navigation smooth and effortless, enhancing my overall workflow.Comfort and Precision: Despite its slim profile, the Magic Mouse is surprisingly comfortable to use for extended periods. The precision of the cursor movement is exceptional, making tasks like photo editing and graphic design a breeze.Delivered on April 30, 2024, near the front door or porch, my package arrived in acceptable used condition, but it functions like new. For $44.10, it was an incredible deal! Though the return window closed on May 16, 2024, I have no regrets.In summary, the Apple Magic Mouse is a perfect blend of style and functionality. Whether you're a professional or a casual user, this mouse is bound to elevate your computing experience. Highly recommended!"
"November 26, 2024",Purchased quite a while ago still hanging in there works perfect.
"November 26, 2024",Probably received as advertised. Good purchase.!
"November 21, 2024",It is very well made and functional. It is what one expects from Apple. The only reason I did not give it 5-stars is the way the charging port is located. The genius who designed the charging port on the bottom of the mouse should be fired or at least had his/her bonus taken away. How the hell can one used it when it is charged!
"November 20, 2024","This magic works great it just doesn't have a long battery life, have to charge every couple of days. This not tyical of Apple products."
"November 10, 2024",This mouse is heavy duty and does so much more than what an android mouse can do. Im amazed at its functions. Click quality can be managed for you as well as changing to a left click or right click. Best best for my money. Who knew a mouse could do so many things. Works great on my Mac Book Pro. Its weighty not a cheap plastic mouse. Extremely happy that I found this mouse for Apple computers.
"October 26, 2024","Last year I bought a new Mac Mini. Of course, it's just a box and requires a mouse, keyboard and monitor. My wife had an old, dead iMac, so I borrowed her keyboard (took it, actually lol). I had a monitor. But what I didn't have was a mouse. So my wife dug up an old Jolly Comb she'd been using on something else. One of those that requires you to plug in a dongle. Since it's battery powered, it also goes to sleep when you haven't used it for x minutes. Meaning you lose the cursor.And you lose a USB port. I do some music production, and that means I need USB ports, as many as I can get. So I finally got this Apple mouse, which I'd used years before.Un-plug the dongle, pair the Apple mouse once with a USB cable, and voila! I have a very responsive mouse, the cursor is always there (unless I'm typing etc.) and freed up that valuable USB port.Free of wires, another free USB port - life is good! :)"
"October 22, 2024","Apple products are such high quality it practically goes without saying but I said it anyway. The one thing I did not like about the Magic Mouse were the seemingly sharp edges on the top due to extreme cut over angle from top to sides. Therefore, I turned it off and pulled out a file and proceeded to gently file the edges down. I then used a fingernail emory board to finalize the rolled edge. Now it feels wonderful under my fingers. I have it four stars since I had to customize it before I felt comfortable using it."
"October 21, 2024","Nice mouse, functions fine, WAY too expensive as all apple products are for what it is."
"October 19, 2024","If you are a music producer, video editor, etc who uses a Mac, Get this! I cant explain how much it has improved my workflow using Logic Pro and Davinci Resolve. The battery life is actually insane as well, from the time of purchase to now I have not had to charge the mouse once so this perfectly makes up for the awkward position it has to be in while charging (which Ive never had to do yet; battery life 73%). Now Im not sure about other computers but I would absolutely vouch for this thing for anyone who uses Mac and needs to upgrade their workflow. The scrolling is elegant and better than any other mouse Ive ever used (specifically for Mac softwares); for example in Logic Pro I can finally scroll sideways instead of have to keep clicking back where I want to be while doing any editing/recording etc. This thing is a game changer. Not very ergonomic as other people said but its more subjective than not Id say, for me I dont mind the design at all and havent experienced any cramps or anything. That being said I wouldnt recommend for gaming but most certainly for editing/digital workflows on any Mac software."
"October 18, 2024",Took a little getting used to but now quite happy with the purchase. I am a first time MacBook Air user (had only used windows previously).Would recommend watching any tutorials you can find to use it to its max potential.
"October 18, 2024",Not the greatest functionality for the price.  Also disappointed the return window was only two weeks.  I went to return after really giving it a shot and was past window.
"October 16, 2024",Exactly what I expected
"October 4, 2024",It has taken me weeks to really be able to use it correctly. For younger users I'm sure no problem. I'm 84 tomorrow.
"September 12, 2024","This is a rechargeable mouse. I had one about 10 yers ago that uses batteries. This one is good because you just need to recharge it with lightening cable. If the charging port is C-type, would be even better."
"September 5, 2024","I like the mouse but the fact that it charges on bottom is obnoxious. You have to literally stop working. Kinda ruins this mouse for me because when you are focused and it goes dead with zero warning, it ruins your work focus."
"September 3, 2024","This is my second mac mouse. This one is smaller then the first one i had and really uncomfortable to hold.  I use the mouse all day and many times a day it won't track.  I tried everything, cleaning, turning bluetooth on and off.  Nothing works.  I am just going to get a 10$ mouse and hope it is better."
"August 14, 2024","Required full OS updates on M2 MacBook Air before full functionality was available (scrolling and swiping did not work until I updated). ""Auto"" connecting requires clicking the mouse before it will connect without going back into Bluetooth settings."
"August 7, 2024",It's too bad that even magic mice die.  Apple accessories are way overpriced but necessary.
"July 28, 2024",Plug n play. Excellent device.
"July 21, 2024","I like the fact that  it is made to do more than a traditional mouse.  It does take a minute to connect to the  computer.  I have found that if I turn it on first, it seems to connect faster."
"July 6, 2024","Connected to my new Mac Mini M4 lickity split. The new Mac knew I meant to pair it with this mouse, not the other Mac mouse 15 feet distant, paired with my M1 mini.So far, everything I'd expect from a magic mouse 2. I suspect it charges faster than my other (Lightening)  Mouse 2."
"June 26, 2024","Honestly it just feels weird to use, and it’s not exactly ergonomic."
"June 22, 2024","Based on the product information, the Apple Magic Mouse is designed to work with Mac computers and may have limited compatibility with non-Apple devices. It connects via Bluetooth and is optimized for use with macOS.frždrI was not able to use it.  I have Windows."
"April 26, 2024","On the positive side, buy the white one it works as well as the black one and is a lot cheaper!After using standard mice with batteries for years, I have a steep learning curve ahead of me. In fact when I use my MacBook sitting on the couch, I don’t use the mouse at all.I really can’t rate it properly until I have used it for some time. It feels good, looks good and coming from Apple should be fine until they produce another one every Apple lover needs to have🤑"
"February 27, 2024","The Magic Mouse is everything you’d expect from Apple—clean design and smooth functionality. The wireless connection is rock solid, and it pairs effortlessly with my Mac. The Multi-Touch surface is a game changer, making navigation feel intuitive and responsive. Plus, the rechargeable battery means no more digging for spare AA batteries. It’s a sleek addition to any setup, and it just works."
"October 22, 2023","If you have used one of these mice before then you don't really need a review. I'll just say it looks nice in black although it starts looking dirty slightly easier than the white one.If you haven't used this product before, these are some important considerations:a. It's the most Mac-compatible mouse that I know of, it being from the same company. So you'll have access to all the nice gestures and features. That is a huge plus if you're a fan of the MacOS interface.b. Its biggest flaw by far is the charging situation. The charging port is BELOW the mouse, making it physically impossible to charge the mouse WHILE using it. Battery lasts for a long time though, so it might be very rare that you cannot use it because it's charging--just remember to do so while you're away and you'll be good to go.c. As I mentioned, battery life is really good. You can also leave it sleeping without turning it off and nothing bad will happen. I think I charge mine every couple of months, with 3-5 days a week of usage.d. If you want this for gaming, DO NOT BUY, as you have no buttons, scroll wheel, and the sensor is totally tuned for everyday browsing and editing and not for precise movements, and its movement is very assisted (although I'm not sure to what extent that's on MacOS's side).e. About looks, it definitely looks nice both in white and black. Its wireless so it looks nice and elegant.f. On build quality, some units are not on par with the best of Apple's products, but it is still very solid. It definitely doesn't feel cheap although it's definitely pricey for what it does, considering that it hasn't been upgraded in many years.TL;DR: 4/5 stars. Negative: charging port, price. Positive: MacOS gestures, long battery life, looks a feels good."
"May 31, 2022","It's just like I purchased the mouse directly from Apple. It connected easily and works with my MacBook and iPad without issue. The battery life is AMAZING! I've had it for nearly a month and I only had to charge it once. Also, the feel in my hand is amazing. I also love the fact that it doesn't have the wheel but responds to fingers scrolling like on the screen. Totally worth the money I spent on it. I would buy another if I needed it."
"February 24, 2022","Very durable, the weight is good, Functionality is good, value for money, fits perfectly in hand. Thank you."
